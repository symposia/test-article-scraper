    "text": "Prosecutors in Washington state say Huawei stole trade secrets from T-Mobile, and that it offered bonuses to employees who were successful in obtaining technology from rivals. The 13-count indictment in Brooklyn, New York claims the company and two affiliates committed bank fraud and violated sanctions when it carried out business with Iran.

The engineers allegedly took photos and measurements of Tappy and stole parts to improve Huawei's own robot. In 2017, a Seattle jury awarded T-Mobile $4.8 million in a related suit against Huawei.\n\nLast month, Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Canada for allegedly committing fraud to bypass Iran sanctions. She was released on bail, though faces extradition to the US after she was charged in the Brooklyn indictment.\n\nThere are signs elsewhere that the US-China trade issue may rumble on, particularly with regards to telecoms. Earlier this month, congresspeople and senators introduced bills that seek to enforce export bans on Chinese telecoms convicted of violating US sanctions and export laws. One of the bills' co-sponsors said the likes of Huawei and ZTE are growing threats to US national security.\n\nMeanwhile, US and Chinese officials are scheduled to meet this week to work on a deal that could end a tariff war between the two nations. It's unclear if or how the Huawei charges will affect the talks, though Ross claimed they're \"wholly separate from trade negotiations.\""

    "title": "Huawei's Many Troubles: Bans, Alleged Spies, and Backdoors",
    "text": "Bad news keeps piling up for Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei. Last week an employee was arrested in Poland on espionage charges. This week, the company's products, which include both phones and network gear, were banned from Taiwanese government systems, the South China Morning Post reported, over concerns that Huawei could build backdoors into its products on behalf of the Chinese government. To top it off, US prosecutors have launched a criminal investigation into accusations that Huawei stole intellectual property from T-Mobile and other companies, The Wall Street Journal reports.\n\nTaiwan's decision follows Australia's announcement last year that it will ban the country's carriers from buying equipment for next-generation 5G networks from Huawei and other Chinese telecom companies over fears of government ties. Huawei is already effectively barred from selling equipment or phones in the US.\n\nBut things could still get worse. The UK, Canada, the Czech Republic, Norway, and Japan are all reportedly reconsidering their relationships with Huawei as well.\n\nHuawei\u2019s escalating troubles come amid sharply rising tensions between the US and China over trade, intellectual property, and geopolitics. Some of the suspicions about Huawei\u2019s connections to the Chinese government go back years, but the recent spate of arrests, bans, and complaints is new.\n\n\"These Huawei problems have been bubbling under the surface for quite a few years,\" telecom industry analyst Jeff Kagan says. \"Now they are at a rapid boil, and there is no hiding from it. And this rapid boil is only going to get worse.\"\n\nIn a rare press conference Tuesday, Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei said the company doesn't spy on behalf of the Chinese government. \"I support the Communist Party of China, but I will never do anything to harm any other nation,\" Ren said, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe big question is whether these are temporary setbacks, or if they mark a global retreat that will knock Huawei from its perch as the world's largest seller of telecommunications gear.\n\nSome of Huawei\u2019s problems stem not from countries deciding not to do business with it, but from allegedly selling equipment to Iran, which is forbidden by US sanctions. Last month, Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou, who is also Ren's daughter, was arrested in Canada for defrauding financial institutions about Huawei\u2019s relationship to an apparent subsidiary that sold equipment to Iran. She's awaiting extradition to the US.\n\nLEARN MORE The WIRED Guide to 5G\n\nThe consequences for violating sanctions against Iran can be severe. Last year, another Chinese telecom giant, ZTE, announced that it would halt its operations after the US Department of Commerce banned US companies from doing business with ZTE because of its sales to Iran. The US ultimately decided to drop the ban, saving ZTE, but the company still had to agree to pay a $900 million fine (on top of an earlier $1 billion fine), replace its entire board and senior leadership, and allow a team of US \"compliance coordinators\" to monitor its compliance with US trade laws.\n\nThe fact that the US wasn't willing to ban American companies from doing business with ZTE suggests it won't be willing to ban sales to Huawei either. But US officials appear to be taking a harder line against Huawei than ZTE: No ZTE executives were arrested.\n\nAnalysts say Huawei isn't as vulnerable as ZTE. \"Huawei is more financially stable than ZTE was,\" says industry consultant Chetan Sharma. \"And Huawei is less dependent on the handset business than ZTE.\" Plus, Huawei's handset business is less dependent on technology from US companies than ZTE is, Sharma says.\n\nFor example, Huawei is building its own alternative to Google's Android operating system; US-based Qualcomm dominates the market for high-end mobile chips, but Huawei could buy from other suppliers, such as Samsung in South Korea. Meanwhile, the Chinese government is trying to kick-start the domestic chip industry through its $20 billion Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund.\n\nBut being able to survive doesn't mean that tougher US sanctions against Huawei wouldn't damage the company, especially if more countries end up banning Huawei's equipment. Losing access to big markets like Germany or India would be particularly bad for the company.\n\nThe good news for Huawei is that even countries that block it from building new networks will likely still have to rely on the company to maintain their 4G networks under existing contracts, Sharma says. \"These things don't happen overnight, they happen over the space of years,\" he says.\n\nThe bad news is that it's going to be extremely hard for Huawei to repair its image abroad, and much of its future is in the hands of the Chinese government. There's little more Huawei itself can do to build trust. Huawei already allows the UK government to inspect its source code for backdoors, for example, but last month the chief of the UK's secret intelligence service, Alex Younger, said deciding whether to allow Huawei to build the country's infrastructure would be a difficult choice, The New York Times reported in December.\n\nSharma says a decline in cyberattacks originating from China, along with reform of the country's intellectual property rules\u2014a major concern in the Trump administration's trade negotiations with China\u2014could go a long way toward repairing the relationship between Chinese companies and the rest of the world. But Kagan isn't so optimistic.\n\n\"I don't think it can be corrected,\" Kagan says. \"The only way Huawei gets through this is if some customers and countries decide they don\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories"

    "text": "The US-China tension over Huawei is leaving telecommunications companies around the world at a crossroad, but one spoke out last week. Telus, one of Canada\u2019s largest phone companies showed support for its Chinese partner despite a global backlash against Huawei over cybersecurity threats.\n\n\u201cClearly, Huawei remains a viable and reliable participant in the Canadian telecommunications space, bolstered by globally leading innovation, comprehensive security measures, and new software upgrades,\u201d said an internal memo signed by a Telus executive that The Globe and Mail obtained.\n\nThe Vancouver-based firm is among a handful of Canadian companies that could potentially leverage the Shenzhen-based company to build out 5G systems, the technology that speeds up not just mobile connection but more crucially powers emerging fields like low-latency autonomous driving and 8K video streaming. TechCrunch has contacted Telus for comments and will update the article when more information becomes available.\n\nThe United States has long worried that China\u2019s telecom equipment makers could be beholden to Beijing and thus pose espionage risks. As fears heighten, President Donald Trump is reportedly mulling a boycott of Huawei and ZTE this year, according to Reuters. The Wall Street Journal reported last week that US federal prosecutors may bring criminal charges against Huawei for stealing trade secrets.\n\nAustralia and New Zealand have both blocked local providers from using Huawei components. The United Kingdom has not officially banned Huawei but its authorities have come under pressure to take sides soon.\n\nCanada, which is part of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network alongside Australia, New Zealand, the UK and the US, is still conducting a security review ahead of its 5G rollout but has been urged by neighboring US to steer clear of Huawei in building the next-gen tech.\n\nChina has hit back at spy claims against its tech crown jewel over the past months. Last week, its ambassador to Canada Lu Shaye warned that blocking the world\u2019s largest telecom equipment maker may yield repercussions.\n\n\u201cI always have concerns that Canada may make the same decision as the US, Australia and New Zealand did. And I believe such decisions are not fair because their accusations are groundless,\u201d Lu said at a press conference. \u201cAs for the consequences of banning Huawei from 5G network, I am not sure yet what kind of consequences will be, but I surely believe there will be consequences.\u201d\n\nLast week also saw Huawei chief executive officer Ren Zhengfei appear in a rare interview with international media. At the roundtable, he denied security charges against the firm he founded in 1987 and cautioned the exclusion of Chinese firms may delay plans in the US to deliver ultra-high-speed networks to rural populations \u2014 including to the rich.\n\n\u201cIf Huawei is not involved in this, these districts may have to pay very high prices in order to enjoy that level of experience,\u201d argued Ren. \u201cThose countries may voluntarily approach Huawei and ask Huawei to sell them 5G products rather than banning Huawei from selling 5G systems.\u201d\n\nThe Huawei controversy comes as the US and China are locked in a trade war that\u2019s sending reverberations across countries that rely on the US for security protection and China for investment and increasingly skilled \u2014 not just cheap \u2014 labor.\n\nCanada got caught between the feuding giants after it arrested Huawei\u2019s chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, who\u2019s also Ren\u2019s daughter, at the request of US authorities. The White House is now facing a deadline at the end of January to extradite Meng. Meanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Trump are urging Beijing to release two Canadian citizens who Beijing detained following Meng\u2019s arrest."

    "text": "Photo: Getty / Chip Somodevilla\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department on Monday announced two indictments against the Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei, which it said is accused of theft of trade secrets, obstructing justice, and lying to banks over its alleged non-compliance with U.S. sanctions against Iran.\n\n\n\nActing Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said a grand jury in Seattle had returned an indictment alleging 10 federal crimes on the part of two Huawei affiliates related to an alleged \u201cconcerted effort to steal information about a robot that T-Mobile used to test mobile phones.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhitaker said Huawei engineers had violated confidentiality agreements by \u201csecretly taking photos of the robot, measuring it, and even stealing a piece of it.\u201d The robot, nicknamed \u201cTappy,\u201d is used to perform durability tests on phones sold by T-Mobile, according to an earlier report by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nA grand jury in New York separately returned an indictment for 13 additional crimes allegedly committed by Huawei, a U.S. subsidiary (Huawei USA), and an Iranian affiliate (Skycom). Additionally, Huawei\u2019s chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, who was arrested in Canada in December at the U.S. government\u2019s request, was charged in what Whitaker described as criminal activity spanning more than a decade, going \u201call the way to the top of the company.\u201d\n\nSpecifically, Huawei and Skycom are charged with bank fraud and conspiracy to commit bank fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, violations of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and conspiracy to violate IEEPA, and conspiracy to commit money laundering, according to the DOJ. Further, as part of an investigation in the Eastern District of New York, Huawei and its U.S. subsidiary are charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhitaker said the U.S. is currently seeking an extradition order in Canada for Meng, who has said she is innocent of charges, which include bank fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracy to commit both.\n\n\u201cAs early as 2007, Huawei employees allegedly began to misrepresent the company\u2019s relationship with its Iranian affiliate, which is called Skycom,\u201d said Whitaker. \u201cHuawei employees reportedly told banking partners that Huawei had sold its ownership interest in SkyCom. But these claims were false. In reality, Huawei had sold Skycom to itself.\u201d\n\nThe reason for Huawei\u2019s deception, Whitaker said, was to conceal the fact that the company was not in compliance with American sanctions. \u201cThese alleged false claims led banks to do business with the company, and therefore to unknowingly violate our laws,\u201d he said, adding the one bank had \u201cfacilitated more than $100 million worth of Skycom transactions through the United States in four years.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHuawei is also accused of lying to the U.S. government and obstructing justice, he said, including by concealing and destroying evidence and moving potential witnesses back to China and therefore out of the reach of U.S. prosecutors.\n\n\u201cAs charged in the indictment, Huawei and its Chief Financial Officer broke U.S. law and have engaged in a fraudulent financial scheme that is detrimental to the security of the United States,\u201d said Homeland Security Kirstjen Secretary Nielsen. \u201cThey willfully conducted millions of dollars in transactions that were in direct violation of the Iranian Transactions and Sanctions Regulations, and such behavior will not be tolerated.\u201d\n\nHuawei did not immediately respond to Gizmodo\u2019s request for comment on the charges and related allegations."

    "title": "Canada's Ambassador to China Fired for Saying End of Huawei Extradition Case Would Be 'Great'",
    "text": "Photo: Mark Schiefelbein (AP)\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has fired the country\u2019s ambassador to China, John McCallum, for saying that the detained chief financial officer of Chinese tech giant Huawei could make a strong case to avoid extradition to the U.S.\u2014and that perhaps it would be really good if Canada just backed down on the matter, the Guardian reported on Saturday.\n\n\n\nMeng Wanzhou, the executive in question and the daughter of Huawei\u2019s founder Ren Zhengfei, was detained in Canada in late 2018 at the behest of U.S. authorities who accuse her of overseeing a labyrinthine scheme to evade nuclear sanctions imposed on Iran. The incident has greatly damaged relations between Canada and China, which has characterized the ongoing court battles over Meng as an abuse of power.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMcCallum told the Star on Jan. 25 that \u201cFrom Canada\u2019s point of view, if (the U.S.) drops the extradition request, that would be great for Canada.\u201d As the Star noted, he had previously told a group Chinese-language journalists that Meng has \u201cstrong arguments\u201d to prevent her extradition from Canada and that it \u201cwould not be a happy outcome\u201d if she was sent to the U.S. He later apologized and said he misspoke, though the Star noted:\n\nThose reading between the lines in Beijing as in Washington could reasonably conclude that, should the American extradition application pass a court examination, the government might be open \u2014 on some conditions \u2014 to use its political discretion to prevent it.\n\nCanadian authorities have been moving the case forward as the Jan. 30 deadline for the U.S. to formally request Meng\u2019s extradition looms. But as the New York Times noted, Trudeau\u2019s government is under great pressure not to politicize the case, and McCallum\u2019s remarks \u201cstunned seasoned diplomatic observers.\u201d The case may affect the fates of three Canadians currently in Chinese custody, two of whom were detained on the vague grounds of \u201cendangering national security\u201d and another sentenced to death for alleged drug smuggling, the Times wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA former member of Parliament, McCallum had also previously had top-level jobs as the minister of defense, veterans affairs, national revenue, and immigration, refugees, and citizenship. According to the BBC, his wife is ethnically Chinese and \u201che had a large Chinese-Canadian population in his former constituency in Ontario,\u201d factors which drove his original interest in the ambassadorship.\n\nTrudeau issued a statement on Saturday saying: \u201cLast night I asked for and accepted John McCallum\u2019s resignation as Canada\u2019s Ambassador to China. For almost two decades, John McCallum has served Canadians honourably and with distinction... I thank him and his family for his service over the past many years.\u201d\n\nMcCallum \u201creally made it untenable for the prime minister to sustain him [in his post] for any length of time and he had to go,\u201d Brock University professor and former diplomat Charles Burton told the Guardian.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIn private discussions with the Chinese he might be able to say those things,\u201d Canadian Global Affairs Institute vice president and former diplomat Colin Robertson told CBC News. \u201cTo say those things publicly is completely counter to what the prime minister and Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland have been saying\u2014that this is a judicial process based on the rule of law.\u201d\n\nMeng was granted bail in December 2018, though under conditions including a strict curfew, ankle GPS monitoring bracelet, and hiring a 24/7 security team at her Vancouver residence. The BBC wrote that the Chinese government is still lobbying to have the extradition request withdrawn, though the U.S. shows no sign of backing down. Chinese officials have also denied that the fate of the three Canadians is tied to the diplomatic showdown, the BBC added.\n\nHuawei faces other problems in the U.S., which is still in the middle of a trade war with China. Those include reports that the Department of Justice is preparing for a criminal case against the company over alleged trade theft and continued accusations (albeit without hard evidence) it could be spying on behalf of the Chinese military or intelligence agencies. Ren has publicly denied the espionage accusations, though the U.S. and several of its allies have imposed restrictions on its ability to do business, particularly in the field of telecommunications gear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[The Guardian]"

    "text": "Photo: Vincent Yu (AP)\n\nFederal prosecutors \u201care pursuing a criminal investigation\u201d of Chinese tech giant Huawei for allegedly stealing the trade secrets of U.S. firms, with the case in part based on allegations raised in civil lawsuits, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nInvestigators are particularly interested in a 2014 legal dispute between Huawei and T-Mobile\u2014which resulted in a Seattle jury finding the former liable for stealing designs and parts for a secret cell-phone testing robot last year. The device, nicknamed \u201cTappy,\u201d allegedly attracted Huawei\u2019s attention after T-Mobile hired the company to supply cell phones:\n\nIn one alleged instance, two Huawei employees slipped a third one into a testing lab to take unauthorized photos of the robot. One employee also tried to hide the fingerlike tip of \u201cTappy\u201d behind a computer monitor so that it would be out of view of a security camera, and then tried to sneak the tip out of the lab in his laptop-computer bag, according to the lawsuit. That employee later admitted that he took the component because Huawei\u2019s research and development office believed the information would improve its own robot, the lawsuit said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHuawei argued in court that \u201cTappy\u201d was not a secret, the Journal wrote, with videos of the robot present on YouTube and extensive technical information already \u201cpublished in numerous patents.\u201d However, Huawei lost the case to the tune of $4.8 million, with the jury deciding the incident constituted a breach of contract. T-Mobile has described itself as one victim in a series of similar attempts to steal technology.\n\nThe Journal wrote that sources familiar with the inquiry say it is at an advanced stage and nearing a possible indictment; neither the Justice Department or Huawei agreed to comment on the record to the paper. Bloomberg reported later on Wednesday that their own sources had confirmed the story.\n\n\n\nHuawei is already facing significant scrutiny from the U.S., which is currently still in the midst of a trade war with China. That includes having Canadian authorities detain its chief financial officer (and daughter of its founder, Ren Zhengfei) Meng Wanzhou for extradition on charges she oversaw a byzantine, fraudulent scheme to evade sanctions on Iran, a move that infuriated the Chinese government. Separate allegations that Huawei could be spying on the behalf of Chinese intelligence agencies have resulted in the U.S. prohibiting the use of its technology for government work, as well as barring it from installing telecom equipment in major markets. Other restrictions have been imposed by some U.S. allies.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, U.S. intelligence and cybersecurity officials have not released hard evidence implicating Huawei in spying (a fact recently noted by the chief of Germany\u2019s Federal Office for Information Security, Arne Schoenbohm.)\n\nAs the Journal noted, there is pressure growing in Congress to pass a law banning the export of U.S. products to companies that violate international sanctions\u2014with Huawei and fellow Chinese tech company ZTE clearly the target. Ren himself gave a \u201crare public appearance\u201d on Tuesday, the Journal separately reported, to issue a strong denial of the espionage allegations:\n\n\u201cNo law requires any company in China to install mandatory back doors,\u201d Ren Zhengfei said, according to the Journal. \u201cI personally would never harm the interest of my customers and me, and my company would not answer to such requests.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[WSJ]"

    "title": "FBI conducted sting operation on Huawei at CES: report",
    "text": "While companies were showcasing the latest technology at CES this year, the FBI was carrying out a sting operation on the world\u2019s second largest smartphone manufacturer.\n\nA small U.S. startup from Illinois, Akhan Semiconductor, reached out to the FBI when the company suspected that Huawei was attempting to steal its intellectual property, according to Bloomberg . After months of investigating, the FBI recruited Akhan founder Adam Khan and COO Carl Shurboff to meet with executives of the Chinese smartphone giant at last month\u2019s CES for a sting operation.\n\nIn 2018, Huawei ordered a sample of Akhan\u2019s Miraj Diamond Glass product, a screen that the company describes as nearly indestructible. Akhan says its 6 times stronger and 10 times more scratch-resistant than the industry standard Gorilla Glass. The two companies had been in discussions since 2016 after San Diego-based Huawei engineer, Angel Han, reached out.\n\nAkhan shipped a Miraj sample to Huawei\u2019s San Diego testing facility in March. Huawei was supposed to return the sample within 60 days. The smartphone company missed the May deadline and ignored most of Akhan\u2019s followup emails. Huawei finally returned the Miraj sample in August, broken in half, with shards of the glass missing.\n\nSuspecting that Huawei was attempting to steal his company\u2019s technology, Khan contacted the FBI. The agency took an interest in the case and spent months pouring over emails between the two companies and other documents. An FBI forensic gemology expert analyzed the broken Miraj sample and found that Huawei had likely blasted it with a 100-kilowatt laser.\n\nThis past December, with the FBI tapped into the call, Khan and Shurboff spoke to Huawei engineer Han who admitted the sample had been sent to China. This revelation put Huawei in violation of U.S. export laws. The company was specifically violating International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), which cover exported material with military application. Diamond coatings, like Akhan\u2019s product, fall under these regulations. Akhan had warned Huawei that the company had to abide by these rules when sending the company its sample.\n\nHan agreed to meet with Khan and Shurboff in Vegas during CES in January after the Huawei engineer continued to express interest in becoming a customer. The FBI sting was carried out at Prime Burger in the Venetian where a Bloomberg reporter listened in from a nearby gelato stand. Han and a Huawei senior supply manager both denied that the company violated ITAR and focused the conversation on a future working relationship between the two companies.\n\nWeeks later, the FBI raided Huawei\u2019s San Diego facility. Akhan is currently unaware of the status of the case.\n\nHuawei has long been a U.S. target due to spying concerns. Intelligence officials have accused the company of being a spy for the Chinese government. This past summer, President Donald Trump banned U.S. governmental use of Huawei products over these surveillance concerns."

Officials have long suspected Huawei of working to advance Beijing\u2019s global ambitions and undermine America\u2019s interests and have begun taking steps to curb its international presence.\n\nThe charges underscore Washington\u2019s determination to prove that Huawei poses a national security threat and to convince other nations that it cannot be trusted to build their next generation of wireless networks, known as 5G. The indictments, based in part on the company\u2019s internal emails, describe a plot to steal testing equipment from T-Mobile laboratories in Bellevue, Wash. They also cite internal memos, obtained from Ms. Meng, that prosecutors said link her to an elaborate bank fraud that helped Huawei profit by evading Iran sanctions.\n\nThe acting attorney general, Matthew G. Whitaker, flanked by the heads of several other cabinet agencies, said the United States would seek to have Ms. Meng extradited from Canada, where she was detained last year at the request of the United States."

She faces extradition to the US for allegedly evading sanctions on Iran.\n\nThe indictments, by the US Department of Justice, have only been partially unsealed, but here's what we know so far:\n\nThe Iranian connection\n\nUnder the first indictment, Huawei and Ms Meng are charged with misleading banks and the US government about their business in Iran.\n\nIt is alleged that, from 2009-14, the two deliberately dodged sanctions against Iran by dealing through a company called Skycom.\n\nMs Meng and other Huawei executives - including an unnamed \"founder\" - allegedly called Skycom a \"local partner.\"\n\nProsecutors, however, say Skycom was owned by Huawei through a subsidiary company.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Meng Wanzhou is the daughter of Huawei's founder\n\nMs Meng is also accused of lying to banks about her relationship with Skycom.\n\nIf found guilty of the charges against her, she faces up to 30 years in prison. Huawei would also be forced to pay financial penalties.\n\n'Stealing secrets' from T-Mobile\n\nIn the second indictment, Huawei has been landed with 10 criminal charges including obstruction of justice and the attempted theft of trade secrets.\n\nProsecutors say it deliberately tried to steal robot technology from network provider T-Mobile.\n\nThe robot, known as Tappy, mimicked human fingers to test phone durability and was kept in a secure lab in Washington state.\n\nThe technology behind it was a closely-guarded secret but T-Mobile allowed some phone manufacturers to use Tappy within the lab.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Huawei is now the second biggest smartphone-maker after Samsung\n\nIn 2012, engineers at Huawei's US branch were given access to Tappy after the two companies entered into a supply agreement.\n\nFor this access, Huawei had to sign a non-disclosure agreement. Prosecutors allege that it violated this agreement.\n\nCiting emails and phone calls, it is claimed that Huawei engineers in the US were directed by executives in China to take photos and share notes of Tappy's specifications.\n\nIn one instance, a Huawei engineer (referred to as AX) allegedly took the robot arm from T-Mobile's lab without permission. AX first denied stealing the arm but \"later claimed he found it in his bag\". According to the indictment, AX returned the arm but first emailed pictures and technical information to colleagues in China.\n\nAfter the incident, Huawei told T-Mobile that it had launched an internal investigation and found that the people involved had \"acted on their own\".\n\nDespite Huawei's attempts to distance itself, prosecutors say that - at the time of the report - Huawei's China branch launched a \"bonus programme to reward employees who stole confidential info from competitors\".\n\nIf found guilty of the charges Huawei will be fined up to $5m (\u00a33.8m), or three times the value of the stolen trade secret - whichever is greater.\n\nT-Mobile has already taken Huawei to court over the incident. It tried to claim $500m in damages and settled in 2017 for $4.8m. A jury ruled that Huawei misappropriated trade secrets but had not done so wilfully or with malice. Unlike the new indictment, it was tried as a civil case - not a criminal one.\n\nT-Mobile told the BBC it had no comment to make over the new indictment.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Huawei has come under fire from the US, Australia and New Zealand over security concerns\n\nWhat happens now?\n\nSeveral details of the investigation have been kept private, and it is not yet known what else is in the indictments.\n\nUnder US law a judge will be assigned for each case. The judges will then set deadlines for the next legal steps.\n\nThere is no set timeframe for a resolution and it can often take years for a dispute to make it to court. The matter may even be settled out of court.\n\nFollowing the indictment, the US sent Canada a formal request to extradite Ms Meng for violating US sanctions. Canada's Department of Justice now has 29 days to decide if an extradition hearing should take place.\n\nMs Meng has denied the accusations against her.\n\nIn a statement to the BBC, Huawei also denied any wrongdoing and said it was \"disappointed\" by the charges.\n\nThe firm added that - after Ms Meng's arrest - it had tried meeting with the US Department of Justice to talk about the investigation. It claims this request \"was rejected without explanation\".\n\nChina's foreign ministry has also weighed in on the indictments. It's accused the US of using \"state power to discredit and crack down on specific Chinese companies in an attempt to strangle the enterprises' legitimate and legal operations\"."

    "text": "Image copyright Reuters Image caption Justin Trudeau (R) appointed John McCallum ambassador to China in 2017\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau has fired Canada's ambassador to China, John McCallum.\n\nIt follows controversial comments Mr McCallum made about an extradition case involving a senior executive from the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei.\n\nMr Trudeau said in a statement he had asked John McCallum to step down, but did not offer a reason.\n\nThe detention of Meng Wanzhou, at the request of the US, angered China and soured Canada's relations with Beijing.\n\nMs Meng, Huawei's chief financial officer, is accused by the US of evading sanctions on Iran. Both she and Huawei deny those allegations.\n\nWhat did Justin Trudeau say?\n\nIn a statement, the Canadian prime minister said: \"Last night I asked for and accepted John McCallum's resignation as Canada's ambassador to China.\"\n\nThe veteran diplomat, Mr Trudeau added, had served Canadians honourably and with distinction with many positions in cabinet.\n\nHe also thanked the diplomat and his family for their service.\n\nWhat about the ambassador's remarks?\n\nMr McCallum caused controversy on Tuesday when he publicly argued that the US extradition request for Ms Meng was seriously flawed.\n\nThe next day he issued a statement saying that he \"misspoke\" and regretted that his comments had created \"confusion\".\n\nBut on Friday he was quoted as saying it would be \"great for Canada\" if the US dropped the request.\n\nMr McCallum was appointed Canada's ambassador to China in 2017, stepping down as the immigration minister.\n\nCanadian media say he was eager to take over the posting because of his strong personal connection to China.\n\nMr McCallum's wife is ethnically Chinese, and he had a large Chinese-Canadian population in his former constituency in Ontario.\n\nMr McCallum also served as Canada's defence minister in 2002-03.\n\nWhat's the latest on Meng Wanzhou's case?\n\nShe was arrested on 1 December in Canada's western city of Vancouver at the request of the US.\n\nShe was later granted a C$10m (\u00a35.7m; $7.6m) bail by a local court. But she is under surveillance 24 hours a day and must wear an electronic ankle tag.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Meng Wanzhou denies all the allegations against her\n\nEarlier this month, US officials confirmed they planned to pursue the extradition of Ms Wanzhou.\n\nWashington has 60 days to file a formal demand for extradition, a deadline that will be reached 30 January.\n\nChina's foreign ministry has urged US officials to withdraw the arrest order and refrain from moving ahead with the extradition request.\n\nMs Meng's case has led to rising diplomatic tensions between Canada and China.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Canadian nationals Michael Spavor (left) and Michael Kovrig have been put under \"compulsory measures\"\n\nEarlier this month, a Canadian man was sentenced to death in China after a court said a jail term of 15 years was too lenient.\n\nTwo other Canadians - businessman Michael Spavor and former diplomat Michael Kovrg - were arrested following the detention of Ms Meng.\n\nSome China analysts believe that the arrests were a tit-for-tat response to her detention, a claim Chinese officials have denied."

    "text": "Image copyright AFP Image caption The company launched its 5G network technology at a special event in Beijing\n\nHuawei has a public relations problem - to put it mildly.\n\nLast week, Oxford University said it had decided to decline new research grants from the giant Chinese telecoms company.\n\nThis week, it was Queen's University Belfast.\n\nAnd then it was the Prince's Trust. The charity founded by Prince Charles said it would no longer accept donations from Huawei.\n\nThese are just a few small UK examples of the wider international political controversy in which the company now finds itself engulfed.\n\nBut at the glitzy launch event for its 5G network technology in Beijing, there was no sign that the company was feeling the pressure.\n\nQuite the opposite in fact.\n\nExecutives lined up in front of the big screen to trot out sets of impressive results - consumer business revenue up 50 percent on last year - for example, and ambitious forecasts.\n\nWhile worldwide sales of smartphones look to be falling, Huawei sold over 200 million handsets last year and has set its sights on taking the number one spot from South Korea's Samsung in the next year or so.\n\nHuawei, the audience was told, has so far won a total of 30 foreign contracts to install its 5G network equipment - 18 of them in Europe.\n\nThe message was clear; it is business as usual and any concern about the security of its 5G networks - and their vulnerability to Chinese state espionage - is a sideshow.\n\n\"Only the political guys are making some noise,\" Richard Yu, the CEO of Consumer Business, told journalists after the main presentation.\n\nThat too might be putting it mildly.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Richard Yu is Huawei's CEO of Consumer Business\n\nThe United States, Australia and New Zealand have already stopped Huawei from working on their next generation 5G mobile networks.\n\nGermany is debating whether to do the same.\n\nBritain's BT, the leading telecoms provider, has said it will remove Huawei equipment from its existing 3G and 4G infrastructure and keep it out of the core parts of 5G too.\n\nMeanwhile, Meng Wanzhou, the CFO and daughter of company founder Ren Zhengfei, is under house arrest in Canada, facing a US extradition request over allegations that she defrauded banks in order to sell equipment to Iran, in violation of US sanctions.\n\nThe Chinese government has reacted furiously, claiming the charges against her are politically motivated - all part of the wider strategy to unfairly blunt Huawei's competitive edge.\n\nIt has been threatening serious consequences for both Canada and the US as a result.\n\nWithin days of Ms Meng's arrest, China detained two Canadian citizens, a former diplomat now working as an academic, Michael Kovrig, and a businessman, Michael Spavor.\n\nHuawei is now caught up in an escalating war on three fronts; security, trade and diplomacy.\n\nIt's a place no company would wish to be.\n\nAnd no amount of glitz, glamour and positive numbers at a media presentation can mask the fact that these are serious issues with potentially serious implications.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Vancouver last December\n\nAt the press briefing, I tried to ask Richard Yu whether the company's insistence that it is not beholden to the Chinese government was being undermined by the forthright Chinese diplomatic offensive on its behalf, and the detention of the two Canadians.\n\nA press officer intervened - today was not the day for such questions, he insisted - before Mr Yu repeated earlier assurances that the company was not a pawn of the Chinese state.\n\n\"We will try our best to safeguard the interest of our customers,\" he said. \"We will not do anything which would hurt or harm our customers.\"\n\nI asked again about the strategy - whether it was helpful, given those assurances, to have the Chinese state wade in so hard.\n\n\"I am not in a position to answer that question,\" he replied. \"Sorry.\"\n\nNo technical evidence has yet been produced to show that Huawei gives the Chinese military or intelligence agencies access to its hardware.\n\nIn fact, the concern of the US and its allies appears to be a broader one; given the nature of China's one-party state, if such access were to be requested, no Chinese company could refuse it.\n\nAnd although Huawei's founder has recently been on record recently saying that he would do exactly that, in reality, there's not a court in China and not a single line in the constitution that can constrain the power of the state if it wanted him to break that promise.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Canadians Michael Spavor (L) and Michael Kovrig are being detained in China\n\nIn the end, Huawei is unlikely to find much to convince sceptics on the issue of its independence.\n\nIts only strategy can be to hope that the strength of its products and the competitiveness of its pricing keeps most of the world open for business.\n\nMeanwhile, the extradition case over its CFO rumbles on in Canada, in relation to which Richard Yu did offer one interesting detail at the press briefing.\n\nAs part of its case for the extradition of Ms Wanzhou, the US Justice Department says that, although she was once a frequent visitor to the US, she stopped travelling to the country in the spring of 2017.\n\nThe implication is that she was aware of the US criminal investigation into the company.\n\nHad Mr Yu's travel plans been similarly circumscribed during that period, I asked him?\n\n\"Personally myself I travelled to the US even last year, many times. This year we are just in the beginning. I haven't been to the US yet. But I travelled to the US several times last year. \"\n\n\"And you'll continue to do so?\"\n\n\"Yeah. For us we are doing so, continually. For me, I am doing this,\" he replied.\n\nThat message again - business as usual."

    "title": "US indicts Huawei for stealing T-Mobile robot arm, selling US tech to Iran",
    "text": "US prosecutors unsealed a pair of indictments against Huawei on Monday, escalating the Trump administration's battle with the Chinese smartphone giant. One of the indictments also names Meng Wanzhou\u2014Huawei's chief financial officer and the daughter of the company's founder\u2014and accuses her and the company of selling US technology to Iran in violation of US sanctions laws.\n\nThe other indictment charges Huawei with stealing cell phone testing technology from T-Mobile. And Huawei is accused of stealing the technology in the most literal sense: according to the indictment, a Huawei employee entered a T-Mobile testing lab, put a proprietary robot arm into his laptop bag, and walked out. The heist was the final step in Huawei's increasingly aggressive efforts to learn how T-Mobile's smartphone testing system works.\n\nUS prosecutors argue that the two indictments reveal a culture of deception at the Chinese smartphone giant.\n\n\"Huawei and its senior executives repeatedly refused to respect the laws of the United States and standard international business practices,\" said FBI Director Christopher A. Wray. So the US government has taken the extraordinary step of filing not one but two indictments against a major Chinese company.\n\nThe great testing-robot-arm heist\n\nTo ensure the quality of smartphones it resold to customers, T-Mobile developed a robot called \"Tappy.\" It had a mechanical \"finger\" that could simulate hours of real-world use. The robot was designed to catch flaws in new smartphones before they were sold to customers, helping T-Mobile to raise customer satisfaction levels and reduce returns. Smartphone vendors like Huawei were given access to a lab containing robots they could use to test their own smartphones.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Huawei desperately wanted a testing robot of its own\u2014both to help it pass T-Mobile's tests and to test phones they sold to other carriers around the world. T-Mobile had granted a handful of specific Huawei USA employees access to the testing lab under strict non-disclosure agreements. In mid-2012, people from Huawei China began to pressure these employees to gather more information about how T-Mobile's phones work.\n\nAt first, these efforts were limited to asking T-Mobile employees for more information about the robot. But by January 2013, T-Mobile had grown tired of Huawei employees badgering them for details about how Tappy worked.\n\n\"We CAN'T ask TMO any questions about the robot,\" one US Huawei employee wrote in an email back to headquarters. \"TMO is VERY angry about the questions that we asked. Sorry we can't delivery any more information to you.\" By April, T-Mobile was threatening to ban Huawei employees from the lab if they didn't stop asking questions about the robot.\n\nRather than backing off, Huawei allegedly escalated its industrial-espionage efforts. Huawei allegedly flew an engineer from China to Seattle, where the testing laboratory was located, to personally inspect the T-Mobile robot. The T-Mobile-cleared employees helped the engineer sneak into T-Mobile's lab. A T-Mobile employee discovered that he was in the lab and told him to leave.\n\nUndeterred, they returned to the lab the next day. Once again, the authorized Huawei employees allegedly used their badges to grant access to the Chinese engineer. The engineer \"took numerous unauthorized photographs of Tappy and otherwise gathered technical information about the robot.\" Once again, a T-Mobile employee discovered what was going on and ordered the group to leave.\n\nA furious T-Mobile banned most Huawei personnel from its lab, allowing a single employee to continue testing Huawei phones that were already slated for release by T-Mobile. A couple of weeks later, that employee stole the arm from one of the T-Mobile robots from the lab.\n\n\"As he was preparing to leave the laboratory,\" the employee \"surreptitiously placed one of the Tappy robot arms into his laptop bag and secretly removed it from the laboratory,\" the indictment charges.\n\nOvernight, according to prosecutors, the Chinese engineer performed a detailed technical analysis of the robot arm and took a lot of photographs. \"Some of the photographs depicted the precise width of certain parts of the robot arm by showing a measuring device next to the parts,\" the indictment says.\n\nThe employee returned the robot arm the next morning, saying he had taken it home by accident. T-Mobile wasn't impressed and banned all Huawei personnel from its lab.\n\nHuawei became worried that this incident could anger T-Mobile and ruin Huawei's hopes of breaking into the lucrative US market\u2014T-Mobile had been the first major US carrier to start selling Huawei's phones. So the indictment charges that Huawei went to great lengths to mislead T-Mobile about what happened.\n\nHuawei allegedly had a bonus program for stolen secrets\n\nHuawei allegedly conducted a fraudulent \"internal investigation\" and then wrote a report claiming that the thefts of secrets had been carried out by \"two individuals who acted on their own\" and who \"violated our company's policies and thus were both terminated for cause.\" In reality, prosecutors say, many people at Huawei knew about and supported the employees' actions.\n\nProsecutors say that one Huawei program illustrates just how deep Huawei's culture of stealing secrets went. In July 2013, \"Huawei China launched a formal policy instituting a bonus program to reward employees who stole confidential information from competitors,\" the indictment states. \"Under the policy, Huawei established a formal schedule for rewarding employees for stealing information from competitors based on the confidential value of the information obtained.\" The policy \"emphasized that no employees would be punished for taking actions in accordance with the policy.\"\n\nObviously, the existence of this program could become awkward for Huawei's US subsidiary, which was trying to convince T-Mobile that the Seattle lab incident had been an isolated one. So a Huawei USA official sent out an email to all employees acknowledging that employees may have felt they were \"being encouraged and could possibly earn a monetary award for collecting confidential information regarding our competitors.\"\n\nThe email acknowledged that \"in some foreign countries and regions, such a directive and award program may be normal and within the usual course of business in that region.\" However, the official wrote, \"here in the USA, we do not condone [or] engage in such activities, and such behavior is expressly prohibited by company policies.\"\n\nFederal prosecutors say that a wealth of internal emails shows that this was nonsense\u2014that Huawei's US subsidiary actively participated in efforts to steal secrets about T-Mobile's testing robots.\n\nHuawei\u2019s CFO allegedly lied to US banks about Huawei\u2019s activities in Iran\n\nProsecutors unsealed a second indictment alongside the one alleging theft of T-Mobile's robot trade secrets. This one accused Huawei\u2014and specifically CFO Meng\u2014of lying to Western financial institutions about Huawei's dealings in Iran.\n\nUS law prohibits US companies from selling technology to Iran, and it also prohibits companies in third-party countries like China from re-selling US-made technology to Iran. Companies that flout that ban risk losing access to US-made technology altogether\u2014a punishment the Trump administration briefly imposed on another Chinese smartphone giant, ZTE, over similar issues.\n\nUS financial institutions are also not supposed to provide service to companies doing illicit business in Iran. So when Reuters reported that Huawei was selling technology to Iran via a shell company in 2012, it put Huawei's Western banking partners in an awkward position. In June 2013, Meng met with one financial executive at a bank that was doing business with Huawei.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, she lied about Huawei's dealings in Iran. She claimed that Huawei was complying with US law and denied that the shell company\u2014on whose board she sat\u2014had been created to evade US sanctions. She visited the US in early 2014 and made similar claims, according to talking points obtained by US prosecutors. Prosecutors say that Meng's lies convinced the bank to continue doing business with Huawei.\n\nThese and related charges are apparently at the core of the US effort to extradite Meng, who was seized while she was changing planes in Vancouver. She is now under house arrest in Canada, and the Canadian government has faced pressure from China to free her. After Meng's arrest, China seized two Canadians on charges related to national security. The Chinese government claimed that these actions had nothing to do with Meng's arrest\u2014but that's a little hard to believe.\n\nCorrection: My headline initially said Huawei was indicted for stealing a robot, rather than a robot arm."

    "text": "VANCOUVER (Reuters) - Huawei Technologies Co Ltd\u2019s chief financial officer, the central figure in a high-stakes dispute between the world\u2019s two largest economies, made her first appearance in a Canadian court in more than a month on Tuesday as Ottawa weighs extraditing the Chinese executive to the United States.\n\nMeng Wanzhou, daughter of the Chinese telecommunications company\u2019s founder, attended the hearing in British Columbia Supreme Court during which Justice William Ehrcke approved her request for a change in who is financially responsible for her bail.\n\nCanada arrested Meng on Dec. 1 at the request of the United States, which on Monday brought sweeping charges against Huawei and Meng that paint the company as a threat to U.S. national security. Meng was charged with bank and wire fraud to violate American sanctions against Iran.\n\n\u201cI can confirm that the United States has filed a formal request with my department for the extradition of Ms. Meng,\u201d Justice Minister David Lametti told reporters in Ottawa.\n\nCanada\u2019s government now has a month to decide whether the U.S. extradition request is strong enough to be presented in the British Columbia court. Lametti, asked whether a decision could come sooner than 30 days, said officials \u201cwill take the time that they need to make an enlightened decision based on the evidence in front of them.\u201d\n\nNeither Lametti nor Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland gave any hints on whether Canada would back the extradition request. Freeland told reporters Meng \u201chas been afforded access to Canada\u2019s impartial and objective judicial system.\u201d\n\nEhrcke on Dec. 11 approved Meng\u2019s release on C$10 million ($7.5 million) bail, and she has stayed at a family residence in Vancouver. Canada\u2019s government agreed to her request concerning bail at Tuesday\u2019s hearing, which the judge granted. Ehrcke also postponed Meng\u2019s next scheduled court appearance by a month, to March 6, which comes after the 30-day extradition decision deadline.\n\nBefore the hearing, Meng, who is fighting extradition, spoke with her lawyer David Martin, holding a notepad.\n\nHer arrest further aggravated U.S.-Chinese tensions at a time when the two economic powerhouses are locked in a trade war. President Donald Trump said in December he could intervene in Meng\u2019s case if it would serve U.S. national security interests or help close a trade deal with China.\n\nFollowing Meng\u2019s arrest, China arrested two Canadians on national security grounds. A Chinese court later retried a Canadian man who had been jailed for drug smuggling and sentenced him to death.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Saturday fired his ambassador to China, who had said Meng could make a strong argument against being sent to the United States.\n\n\u2018A HOSTAGE\u2019\n\nIn a previous sworn affidavit, Meng said she is innocent and would contest the allegations at trial in the United States if she is extradited. Her lawyer Reid Weingarten said Meng \u201cshould not be a pawn or a hostage\u201d in \u201ccomplex\u201d Sino-U.S. relations.\n\nHuawei is the world\u2019s largest supplier of telecommunications network equipment and second-biggest maker of smartphones. It derives nearly half of its total revenue outside China.\n\nIn Ottawa, Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said Canada\u2019s decision on whether to ban Huawei from supplying equipment to 5G networks is \u201csome ways off into the future.\u201d\n\nGoodale\u2019s comments were the most specific indication yet from Ottawa on the timing of the politically sensitive announcement. Officials are studying the security implications of 5G networks, the latest generation of cellular mobile communications. The United States and other Canadian allies have already imposed restrictions on Huawei equipment, citing the risk of espionage.\n\nU.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin said on Tuesday he expected significant progress in Washington trade talks with Chinese officials, set for Wednesday and Thursday. Mnuchin said the U.S. security concerns raised by the Huawei case were separate from the trade issue.\n\nChina\u2019s foreign ministry has urged the United States to drop the arrest warrant against Meng and end \u201cunreasonable suppression\u201d of Chinese companies. China has demanded the executive\u2019s immediate release.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Meng Wanzhou, Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's chief financial officer (CFO), is seen in this undated handout photo obtained by Reuters December 6, 2018. Huawei/Handout via REUTERS\n\nHuawei\u2019s global reach has come under attack from the United States, which is trying to prevent U.S. companies from buying Huawei equipment and is pressing allies to do the same. U.S. security experts are worried the gear could be used by China\u2019s government for espionage, a concern Huawei calls unfounded.\n\nU.S. intelligence and national security officials expressed fresh national security concerns about Huawei during a U.S. Senate committee hearing in Washington on Tuesday.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray told lawmakers the lines between \u201cthe Chinese government and ostensibly private companies\u201d are blurred if not totally erased and \u201cespecially the lines between lawful behavior and fair competition and lying and hacking and cheating and stealing.\u201d"

If granted, Meng\u2019s case would be sent to the British Columbia Supreme Court for a hearing, which could take weeks or months.\n\nThe development is likely to upset talks between Beijing and Washington this week as part of negotiations intended to walk back trade tensions between the globe\u2019s two largest economies.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump said in December he could intervene in Meng\u2019s case if it would serve national security interests or help close a trade deal with China.\n\nU.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the charges are \u201cwholly separate\u201d from the trade negotiations.\n\nMARKET RESTRICTION\n\nHuawei makes equipment including base stations, switches and routers, as well as consumer products such as smartphones, and derives nearly half of its total revenue outside China.\n\nIts global reach has come under attack from the United States, which is trying to prevent U.S. companies from buying Huawei equipment and is pressing allies to do the same. U.S. security experts are concerned the gear could be used by China\u2019s government for espionage - a concern Huawei calls unfounded.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Meng Wanzhou, Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's chief financial officer (CFO), is seen in this undated handout photo obtained by Reuters December 6, 2018. Huawei/Handout via REUTERS\n\nAustralia and New Zealand followed the U.S. lead in restricting market access over the past year. On Tuesday, TPG Telecom Ltd canceled the Huawei-based mobile phone network it was building, in the first commercial casualty of Australia\u2019s move.\n\nHuawei nevertheless said it is the world\u2019s leading provider of 5G technology, winning 30 contracts globally - more than any of its competitors - including 18 in Europe.\n\nIt is unclear how the U.S. charges would impact its business. Last year, Chinese peer ZTE Corp was prevented from buying essential components from U.S. firms after pleading guilty to similar charges, crippling its operations.\n\nZTE resumed normal business after paying up to $1.4 billion in fines and replacing its entire board, on top of a near $900 million penalty paid in 2017.\n\nBANKING RELATIONS\n\nU.S. Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said the alleged criminal activity at Huawei \u201cgoes back at least 10 years and goes all the way to the top of the company.\u201d The charges against Meng and Huawei cite the Reuters stories that said Huawei\u2019s Skycom unit sought to sell goods to Iran.\n\nThe indictment noted that denials from Huawei in the stories were relied upon by financial institutions \u201cin determining whether to continue their banking relationships with Huawei and its subsidiaries.\u201d\n\nThe indictment featured a meeting in August 2013 between Meng and an executive from an unidentified bank. Sources told Reuters the bank is HSBC Holdings PLC, which paid $1.92 billion in 2012 for violating U.S. anti-money-laundering and sanctions laws.\n\nDuring the meeting, Meng misrepresented Huawei operations in Iran and ownership and control of Skycom, the indictment showed.\n\nSlideshow (13 Images)\n\nThe Justice Department has confirmed that HSBC is not under investigation in this case, HSBC said in a statement last month.\n\nAlso according to the indictment, in July 2007, the FBI interviewed Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei and U.S. authorities said he falsely told them Huawei did not violate U.S. export laws.\n\nThe indictment concerning trade secret theft alleged that Huawei had a formal policy instituting a bonus program to reward employees who stole confidential information from competitors.\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray said the Huawei cases, filed in New York and Washington state, \u201cexpose Huawei\u2019s brazen and persistent actions to exploit American companies and financial institutions, and to threaten the free and fair global marketplace.\u201d"

Huawei/Handout via REUTERS\n\nCanadian envoy John McCallum\u2019s comments to Chinese-language media, which were broadcast on Wednesday, are the most explicit sign yet from a Canadian official that Meng Wanzhou, Huawei\u2019s chief financial officer, may not be sent to the United States.\n\nMeng was detained on Dec. 1 in Vancouver at the request of the United States reut.rs/2HuT3WE over alleged violations of U.S. sanctions on Iran.

    "text": "WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers introduced bills on Wednesday that would ban the sale of U.S. chips or other components to Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], ZTE Corp or other Chinese telecommunications companies that violate U.S. sanctions or export control laws.\n\nThe proposed law drew sharp criticism from China where Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying called the U.S. legislation \u201chysteria\u201d, intensifying a bitter trade war between Beijing and Washington.\n\nThe bills were introduced shortly before the Wall Street Journal reported federal prosecutors were investigating allegations that Huawei stole trade secrets from T-Mobile U.S. Inc and other U.S. businesses.\n\nThe Journal said that an indictment could be coming soon on allegations that Huawei stole T-Mobile technology, called Tappy, which mimicked human fingers and was used to test smartphones.\n\nHuawei said in a statement the company and T-Mobile settled their disputes in 2017 following a U.S. jury verdict that found \u201cneither damage, unjust enrichment nor wilful and malicious conduct by Huawei in T-Mobile\u2019s trade secret claim\u201d.\n\nHua urged U.S. lawmakers to block the bills.\n\n\u201cI believe the action of these few representatives are an expression of extreme arrogance and an extreme lack of self-confidence,\u201d Hua said.\n\n\u201cActually the whole world can see very clearly that the real intent of the United States is to employ its state apparatus in every conceivable way to suppress and block out China\u2019s high-tech companies,\u201d she added.\n\nThe legislation is the latest in a long list of actions taken to fight what some in the Trump administration call China\u2019s cheating through intellectual property theft, illegal corporate subsidies and rules hampering U.S. corporations that want to sell their goods in China.\n\nPRESSURE MOUNTING\n\nIn November, the U.S. Department of Justice unveiled an initiative to investigate China\u2019s trade practices with a goal of bringing trade secret theft cases.\n\nAt that time, Washington had announced an indictment against Chinese chipmaker Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co Ltd for stealing trade secrets from U.S. semiconductor company Micron Technology relating to research and development of memory storage devices.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The Huawei logo is pictured outside their research facility in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, December 6, 2018. REUTERS/Chris Wattie\n\nJinhua, which has denied any wrongdoing, was put on a list of entities that cannot buy goods from U.S. firms.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Senator Tom Cotton and Representative Mike Gallagher, both Republicans, along with Senator Chris Van Hollen and Representative Ruben Gallego, both Democrats, introduced the bills that would require the president to ban the export of U.S. components to any Chinese telecommunications company that violates U.S. sanctions or export control laws.\n\nThe bills specifically cite ZTE and Huawei, both of which are viewed with suspicion in the United States because of fears that their switches and other gear could be used to spy on Americans. Both have also been accused of failing to respect U.S. sanctions on Iran.\n\n\u201cHuawei is effectively an intelligence-gathering arm of the Chinese Communist Party whose founder and CEO was an engineer for the People\u2019s Liberation Army,\u201d Cotton wrote in a statement. \u201cIf Chinese telecom companies like Huawei violate our sanctions or export control laws, they should receive nothing less than the death penalty - which this denial order would provide.\u201d\n\nThe proposed law and investigation are two of several challenges that Huawei, the world\u2019s biggest telecommunications equipment maker, faces in the U.S. market.\n\nIn addition to allegations of sanctions-busting and intellectual property theft, Washington has been pressing allies to refrain from buying Huawei\u2019s switches and other gear because of fears they will be used by Beijing for espionage.\n\nHuawei\u2019s founder, Ren Zhengfei, denied this week that his company was used by the Chinese government to spy.\n\nChina's ZTE Corp logo is seen at its offices in Caracas, Venezuela October 4, 2018.

    "text": "BEIJING/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Chinese authorities are holding an Australian writer, who used to be a Chinese citizen, on suspicion of endangering state security, China said on Thursday, and his lawyer said he was suspected of espionage.\n\nAustralian officials said Yang Hengjun was detained shortly after he flew in to the southern city of Guangzhou from New York last week, but it did not believe his detention was the result of rising tension between China and the West.\n\nChinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said that Australia was officially notified after Yang was placed under \u201ccoercive measures\u201d - a euphemism for detention - in Beijing.\n\n\u201cThe Australian citizen Yang Jun, due to being suspected of engaging in criminal acts that endangered China\u2019s national security, was recently placed under coercive measures and is being investigated by the Beijing city State Security Bureau,\u201d Hua told reporters.\n\nYang\u2019s rights and interests were being protected in accordance with the law, she told a regular news briefing in Beijing, using a slightly different name for him.\n\nAustralian Defence Minister Christopher Pyne, who arrived in Beijing on Thursday for scheduled talks, said Australia would normally expect to be told of such a case within three days under existing diplomatic conventions.\n\nYang went missing on Friday and Australia was not told until four days later. Pyne said the late notification was disappointing and he would be raising it in his talks with Chinese officials.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s being held in residential surveillance,\u201d Pyne told reporters.\n\nThe Australian government was first alerted that Yang had gone missing after friends said he had been out of contact for several days.\n\nYang\u2019s lawyer, Mo Shaoping, told Reuters that his client was suspected of \u201cespionage\u201d, and was being held under \u201cresidential surveillance at a designated location\u201d.\n\nThe special detention measure allows authorities to interrogate suspects for six months without necessarily granting access to legal representation. Rights groups say that the lack of oversight raises concern about abuse by interrogators.\n\nMo said he had been retained by Yang\u2019s wife but because the case involved state security, he would need approval from the authorities before he would be able to meet Yang.\n\nWARNING\n\nTensions have risen in recent weeks between China and some Western countries after two Canadians, a diplomat on unpaid leave and a consultant, were arrested in China on suspicion of endangering state security.\n\nThose arrests were widely seen in the West as retaliation by China for Canada\u2019s arrest of Meng Wanzhou, a senior Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] executive, on Dec. 1 at the request of the United States for allegedly violating U.S. sanctions on Iran.\n\nAustralia joined international condemnation of the arrest of the two Canadians, but Yang has long been in the sights of Chinese authorities.\n\nHe has criticized what he described as Chinese interference in Australia.\n\nFeng Chongyi, an academic at the University of Technology in Sydney, said he asked Yang not to go to China because of the tension.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think it would be safe for him because of the situation with Huawei but he believed that he would be fine as he had been there so many times,\u201d Feng said.\n\nAustralian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said staff from Australia\u2019s embassy met Chinese officials on Thursday and, while details were limited, she said there was no evidence Yang\u2019s case was linked to Australia\u2019s criticism of the detention of the Canadians.\n\nYang Hengjun, author and former Chinese diplomat, who is now an Australian citizen, gestures in an unspecified location in Tibet, China, sometime in mid-July, 2014 in this social media image obtained by REUTERS\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be concerned if there was an indication of that,\u201d Payne told reporters in Sydney.\n\n\u201cWe are calling on the Chinese authorities to ensure this matter is dealt with transparently and fairly.\u201d\n\n\u2018CAN\u2019T HIDE\u2019\n\nYang was also reported missing for several days while in China in 2011. Two sources familiar with the details said he had been detained but agreed to say he had been unwell.\n\nHowever, Yang is not seen as a radical dissident.\n\nHe became famous in the 2000s for his political essays, which earned him the nickname \u201cdemocracy peddler\u201d. In recent years, he had published little commentary, instead writing more fiction, including a trilogy of spy novels.\n\nDeng Yuwen, a Beijing-based political analyst who knows Yang, told Reuters that he did not know the reason for Yang\u2019s detention but that his WeChat accounts had been deleted.\n\n\u201cHe has basically not publicly released any political essays in recent years,\u201d Deng said.\n\nChinese President Xi Jinping has presided over a crackdown on dissent since coming to power in 2012, with hundreds of rights lawyers and activists detained. Dozens have been jailed.\n\nRelations between Australia and its largest trading partner have been strained in recent years and Pyne\u2019s trip was arranged in a bid to repair ties damaged by Australian accusations in 2017 that China was meddling in its affairs.\n\nAnalysts said Yang\u2019s arrest would add to pressure on Australia to take a stand, and it would prolong tension.\n\nSlideshow (10 Images)\n\n\u201cAustralia can\u2019t hide from this.

    "text": "BEIJING/SYDNEY (Reuters) - A Chinese-born Australian writer detained by authorities in Beijing for suspected espionage has long been a divisive figure among overseas Chinese dissidents and activists.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Yang Hengjun, author and former Chinese diplomat, who is now an Australian citizen, gestures in an unspecified location in Tibet, China, sometime in mid-July, 2014 in this social media image obtained by REUTERS\n\nTo his supporters, Yang Hengjun is a dedicated democracy activist who believed that China\u2019s autocratic system would, with time, necessarily liberalize. His detractors say he had long since abandoned criticizing the ruling Chinese Communist Party in favor of protecting his personal and business interests.\n\nYang, 53, whose legal name is Yang Jun, was detained in southern China\u2019s Guangzhou while waiting for a transfer to Shanghai earlier this month, after flying in from New York.\n\nHe was taken to Beijing, where China has said the city\u2019s State Security Bureau is holding him under \u201ccoercive measures\u201d, a euphemism for detention, as he is investigated on suspicion of \u201cendangering state security\u201d.\n\nYang\u2019s lawyer, Mo Shaoping, told Reuters his client was suspected of \u201cespionage\u201d, and was being held under \u201cresidential surveillance at a designated location\u201d, a special detention measure that allows authorities to interrogate suspects without necessarily granting access to legal representation.\n\nAlthough his recent writing has mostly avoid Chinese politics, Yang first became prominent in the early 2000s when he earned the nickname of \u201cdemocracy peddler\u201d.\n\nBefore censorship of China\u2019s microblogs intensified, Yang\u2019s essays on topics ranging from Chinese nationalism to the fate of ethnic minorities in Tibet, made him a popular commentator. He also wrote a trilogy of spy novels set in China.\n\nMore recently, Yang had largely steered clear of issues deemed sensitive by the Communist Party, only occasionally writing about U.S. politics, and instead had thrown his energy into a \u201cdaigou\u201d business, procuring overseas products for Chinese buyers.\n\nHis store on China\u2019s popular mobile platform WeChat sold U.S.-made luxury bags, vitamins, baby formula and watches.\n\nAn employee of the store, who declined to be named, said that Yang started the store at the request of his readers, who wanted to buy real and fairly priced goods. Asked what would happen to the store now, he said he was waiting for instructions.\n\n\u201cKEEPS TO HIMSELF\u201d\n\nFor the last two years, Yang, who friends describe as an affable, jocular but academic figure, had been living in New York as a visiting scholar at Columbia University.\n\n\u201cHe was quite aloof from politics and tended to keep his personal news to himself,\u201d Yang\u2019s former landlord, New York-based businessman Yi Gai, told Reuters.\n\n\u201cAbout 75 percent of his energy and time was spent on his daigou work,\u201d added Yi, who is also a friend of Yang\u2019s.\n\nAnother friend, who hadn\u2019t spoken to Yang in several months, said the Australian writer believed his views were not a challenge to China\u2019s rulers.\n\n\u201cHe played within the system. He had never called for the bottom to rise up. He wants reform only,\u201d said the friend, who declined to be named for fear for his safety.\n\nFeng Chongyi, an academic at the University of Technology in Sydney, who was himself detained during a 2017 visit to China, said he believed Yang\u2019s detention was related to his international connections.\n\nTensions have risen in recent weeks between China and some Western countries after two Canadians, a diplomat on unpaid leave and a consultant, were arrested in China on suspicion of endangering state security.\n\nThose arrests were widely seen in the West as retaliation by China for Canada\u2019s arrest of Meng Wanzhou, a senior Huawei Technologies executive, on Dec. 1 at the request of the United States for allegedly violating U.S. sanctions on Iran.\n\nAustralian officials have called on China to handle the matter \u201ctransparently and fairly\u201d, but have downplayed the connection between Yang\u2019s case and those of the Canadians.\n\n\u201cHe is well-connected in China and internationally. He knows high-profile people in the Communist Party and he believed that meant he could travel to China with relative impunity,\u201d Feng said.\n\nPOOR BACKGROUND\n\nYang came from a poor background in China, but studied political economy at Shanghai\u2019s prestigious Fudan University, according to his own accounts of his time there.\n\nYang had often told friends that, before his writing career, he worked for China\u2019s Foreign Ministry. But ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told Reuters that Yang had never been employed there.\n\nHe would also tell friends that he knew Wang Huning, the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s chief of ideology, while at Fudan, according to two sources.\n\nFriends say he became an Australian citizen in the early 2000s.\n\nXia Yeliang, a former professor at Peking University who now lives in Virginia, said Yang was a controversial figure among China\u2019s overseas dissident community.\n\nYang was believed in recent years to have married a well-known nationalist blogger, Yuan Ruijuan, souring his reputation among overseas democracy activists, Xia told Reuters by phone.\n\nAt times Yang had said his spy novels, which were serialized on his website, were based on his abundant personal experience within the Chinese system, Xia added.\n\nThe novels pit China\u2019s spy agency against the CIA and FBI and include double-agents, clones, and a main character who, like Yang, wrote fictional spy novels and attended Fudan University.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Yang Hengjun, author and former Chinese diplomat, who is now an Australian citizen, is pictured in an unspecified location in Tibet, China, sometime in Tibet, China, mid-July, 2014 in this social media image obtained by REUTERS\n\nYi, the landlord and friend, said Yang \u201cwas not willing to keep in close contact with radical dissidents, and definitely wouldn\u2019t cooperate with them, so it\u2019s natural that radical dissidents would be suspicious and speculate about him\u201d.\n\nBefore Yang left for China this month, Yi and some friends met him and the topic of his security came up, but everyone thought he would be fine.\n\n\u201cIt looks like we misjudged,\u201d he said."

In an indictment totaling 13 counts, the DoJ says that Huawei lied to banking institutions and the U.S. government about the China headquarters business relations with subsidiaries Skycom Tech and Huawei Device USA so it could conduct trade with and in Iran.\n\nMeng is currently detained in Vancouver by Canadian authorities while the U.S. attempts extradition. The U.S. has given Canada a deadline of January 30 to hand over Meng, who prosecutors say knowingly violated trade sanctions against Iran through a Hong Kong shell company. Acting U.S. Attorney General Matt Whitaker has said the DoJ will continue with extradition efforts; both he and FBI Director Christopher Wray also express their thanks to Canadian officials for their assistance in the matter. Meng denies all charges.\n\nOfficial charges were also announced today against Huawei for stealing trade secrets from T-Mobile US. The indictment lists wire fraud, obstruction of justice and theft of trade secrets stemming from three Huawei employees allegedly taking photos of T-Mobile's testing robot \"Tappy\" during a visit to the company's Bellvue, Washington automated test lab. Huawei has been to court over these allegations twice before: in a civil suit filed in 2014 and another trial in 2017 where T-Mobile was awarded $4.8 million."

Huawei also allegedly offered bonuses to employees who stole confidential information from companies. In addition, a 13-count indictment charged four defendants, including Huawei and Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou, with financial fraud.

The US has already banned Huawei from selling networking equipment here, but a number of other countries have either already ceased working with the company, or are considering a ban. The Chinese government and Huawei have said the moves could have ramifications since the company contributes to industry-standard wireless technologies like 5G.\n\nNow playing: Watch this: 5G smartphones are coming\n\nBoth the US and China are jockeying for leadership in the next-generation of cellular technology, which promises higher speeds and the ability to handle more connected devices.

Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat who's vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.\n\nHuawei, meanwhile, denied any wrongdoing.\n\n\"Huawei is disappointed to learn of the charges brought against the company today,\" the company said in an emailed statement.\n\n\"After Meng's arrest, the company sought an opportunity to discuss the Eastern District of New York investigation with the Justice Department, but the request was rejected without explanation,\" Huawei continued. \"The allegations in the Western District of Washington trade secret indictment were already the subject of a civil suit that was settled by the parties after a Seattle jury found neither damages nor willful and malicious conduct on the trade secret claim.\"\n\nT-Mobile declined to comment.\n\nTwo charges\n\nAccording the first set of indictments, Huawei began stealing information about a phone-testing robot from T-Mobile called Tappy. Huawei engineers allegedly violated confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements by taking pictures of Tappy, taking measurements of parts of the robot and stealing a piece of it. When T-Mobile found out and threatened to sue, Huawei falsely said the theft was done by rogue actors within the company, according to the indictment.\n\nT-Mobile sued anyway, and in 2017 won its case against Huawei, with a jury awarding it $4.8 million.\n\nDespite Huawei's insistence that the action was a one-off affair, the Justice Department says emails obtained during the investigation found that the theft of secrets from T-Mobile was a companywide effort.\n\nIt has been clear for some time that Huawei poses a threat to our national security. Sen. Mark Warner\n\nHuawei could face a fine of up to either $5 million or three times the value of the stolen trade secret, for conspiracy and attempt to steal trade secrets. The company could also face a fine of up to $500,000 for wire fraud and obstruction of justice.\n\nIn the second set of indictments, Meng was charged with bank fraud, wire fraud and conspiracies to commit bank and wire fraud. Huawei and Huawei USA are charged with conspiracy to obstruct justice. Huawei and Skycom are charged with bank fraud and conspiracy to commit bank fraud, wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud, violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act and conspiracy to violate IEEPA, and conspiracy to commit money laundering.\n\nThe charges are related to the company's alleged efforts to evade US sanctions and do business with Iran. Last month, Meng was detained in Canada at the behest of the Justice Department over those claims. While in a Vancouver courthouse to discuss her bail, a lawyer with Canada's Justice Department alleged she defrauded US banks into making transactions that violated those sanctions, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe founder's daughter\n\nNotably, Meng isn't just the CFO of Huawei. She's the daughter of the founder and president, Zhengfei Ren. And her arrest doesn't just have ripple effects across the tech industry; it threatens to blow up an already precarious relationship between the US and China over trade talks.\n\nBeyond trade, others see Huawei as a national security issue.\n\n\"It has been clear for some time that Huawei poses a threat to our national security, and I applaud the Trump Administration for taking steps to finally hold the company accountable,\" Warner said.\n\n[The case] puts every aspect of Huawei's business in jeopardy in the US and EU. Maribel Lopez, analyst\n\nHuawei has consistently denied any wrongdoing by Meng. At the World Economic Forum at Davos, Huawei Chairman Liang Hua called for a quick resolution of the case and the release of Meng, according to Reuters.\n\nMeng's lawyer, Reid Weingarten, told Reuters on Tuesday that she was a victim of \"complex\" China-US relations.\n\n\"Our client, Sabrina Meng, should not be a pawn or a hostage in this relationship.\" he said, using one of her Western names. \"Ms. Meng is an ethical and honorable businesswoman who has never spent a second of her life plotting to violate any US law, including the Iranian sanctions.\"\n\nHuawei also told Reuters that it had sought to discuss the charges with US authorities, \"but the request was rejected without explanation.\"\n\nOver the past few months, Huawei has endured a wave of negative sentiment. UK carrier BT said it'd pull Huawei equipment out of its 4G network and ban it from any future 5G deployments. Japan reportedly banned government purchases from Huawei. Also last month, Andrus Ansip, the EU's technology chief, warned that Huawei and other Chinese companies pose a risk to the bloc's industry and security, according to Reuters.\n\nAll of the negativity could have a trickle-down effect on the company.\n\n\"[The case] puts every aspect of Huawei's business in jeopardy in the US and EU, including consumer sales,\" said Maribel Lopez, an analyst at Lopez Research. \"Instead of being known for innovation, the company is positioned as criminal.\"\n\nFirst published Jan. 28 at 2:09 p.m. PT\n\nUpdate Jan. 29 at 2:59 a.m. PT: Added Reuters comments from Meng's lawyer and Huawei.\n\nUpdate at 5:08 a.m. PT: Added comment from Huawei.\n\nNASA turns 60: The space agency has taken humanity farther than anyone else, and it has plans to go further.\n\nTaking It to Extremes: Mix insane situations -- erupting volcanoes, nuclear meltdowns, 30-foot waves -- with everyday tech.

    "text": "Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nThe US will formally request the extradition of Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou from Canada, according to a Monday report.\n\nCanada's ambassador to the US, David MacNaughton, discussed the impending request with the Toronto-based Globe and Mail but didn't say when it'll happen.\n\nThe Canadian Department of Justice said in an email that it hasn't received an extradition request from the US, and noted that the deadline for filing is Jan. 30 -- 60 days after Meng's Dec. 1 arrest. It'll then have another 30 days to decide whether or not to proceed.\n\nChina reportedly demanded that the US drop its request, with Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying saying Canada's extradition treaty with the US infringed on the \"safety and legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens.\"\n\nMeng is both an executive of Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei and the daughter of company founder Ren Zhengfei. She was arrested in Vancouver at US request over alleged violations of Iran sanctions. She was released on bail last month and has a Feb. 6 court date in Vancouver.\n\nRen Zhengfei made his first public statements to foreign media since 2015 last week to deny allegations that his company had a role in Chinese spying. He also used the opportunity to praise President Donald Trump, who was apparently unaware of the plan to arrest Meng.\n\nTensions between Canada and China have grown since the arrest, with China reportedly warning last week of repercussions if the Canadian government banned Huawei from supplying technology for the country's 5G rollout.\n\nChina also detained two Canadians -- diplomat Michael Kovrig and entrepreneur Michael Spavor -- in the days following Meng's arrest, and a Chinese court sentenced Canadian Robert Lloyd Schellenberg to death in a sudden retrial of a drug smuggling case.\n\nHuawei Chairman Liang Hua spoke out against the extradition request at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. \"We are following this issue closely but haven't had direct contact with the authorities,\" Liang said during a speech. \"We will call for a quick conclusion for Ms. Meng so that Ms. Meng can have her personal freedom.\"\n\nDuring the same speech, Liang vaguely warned that the company may avoid doing business western countries in the future. Specifically Huawei suggested it would take its technology to \"countries where we are welcomed,\" rather than struggle with regulatory restriction. It's an odd statement, but it can be seen as a vague threat to companies looking to move into 5G.\n\nHuawei echoed Liang's comments in an emailed statement.\n\n\"We are aware of the report in question and are closely monitoring the situation,\" it wrote.\n\n\"Huawei complies with all applicable laws and regulations in the countries and regions where we operate, including export control and sanction laws of the UN, US, and EU. We have every confidence that the Canadian and US legal systems will reach a just conclusion.\"\n\nLike many other telecom equipment suppliers, Huawei contributes some of its intellectual property to the global standard for 5G wireless technology. As such, the company holds a lot of influence on what 5G looks like and has developed a number of patents for the technology. Huawei packing up and sticking to only a select number of countries could mean some companies would lose access to its technology.\n\nThat could also hurt countries that have traditionally worked with Huawei, but are considering banning the company from future projects due to security concerns. But it's unclear how big of an impact that would have on countries like the US, which have long banned Huawei from its networks.\n\nLast summer, Huawei overtook Apple to become the world's No. 2 phone seller (behind Samsung), despite many of its devices being unavailable in the US. The US government and its contractors are also restricted from buying certain telecommunications and video surveillance equipment from Huawei and a handful of other Chinese communications companies.\n\nThe US Justice Department didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nFirst published Jan. 22, 7:03 a.m. PT.\n\nUpdated, 11:29 a.m. PT: Adds more background on Huawei.\n\nUpdated 3:22 p.m. PT: Added comments from Huawei chairman.\n\nUpdated Jan. 23, 2:54 a.m. PT: Adds details from Canadian Department of Justice and Huawei comment.\n\n\n\nCES 2019: See all of CNET's coverage of the year's biggest tech show.\n\nBlockchain Decoded: CNET looks at the tech powering bitcoin -- and soon, too, a myriad of services that will change your life."

Huawei already overtook Apple in the second quarter of 2018.\n\n\"This year at the soonest, next year at the latest, we will become No. 1,\" Richard Yu, CEO of Huawei's consumer business, told reporters in Beijing, according to CNN.\n\nHuawei didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nHuawei set a record for itself by shipping more than 200 million phones in 2018, driven by sales of its P20, Honor 10 and Mate 20 models. In December, when it reported the numbers, Huawei said it aimed to become the world's largest phone vendor by the end of 2019. Samsung currently holds that title, but warned earlier this month it expects a dramatic decline in its fourth-quarter profit due in part to intensifying competition in the smartphone market.\n\nHowever, Huawei's journey to the top faces obstacles. Last month, Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Canada at the request of US authorities. Also the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, Meng faces extradition to the US over alleged Iran sanctions violations.\n\nEarlier this month, a Huawei employee was arrested in Poland for allegedly spying for China. Huawei then dismissed the arrested staffer. Also in January, US federal prosecutors launched an investigation into Huawei over allegations that it stole trade secrets from T-Mobile following a lawsuit in 2014 between the two."

The probe is \"at an advanced stage\" the Journal said, citing people familiar with the matter.\n\nAn indictment could come soon, the Journal added.\n\nThe Justice Department didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. Huawei declined to comment.\n\nThe allegations are reportedly related to a 2014 lawsuit between China's Huawei and T-Mobile. A jury in 2017 ruled that Huawei misappropriated T-Mobile's trade secrets and awarded $4.8 million to T-Mobile, according to FierceWireless. Although Huawei lost the case, the jury reportedly didn't find Huawei's misappropriation as \"willful and malicious\" as T-Mobile alleged.\n\nThe probe comes at a tense time for the US and the Chinese telecom giant. Huawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, last month was arrested in Canada at the request of US authorities. Also the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, Meng faced extradition to the US over alleged Iran sanctions violations.\n\nEarlier this month, a Huawei employee was arrested in Poland for allegedly spying for China. The employee is the company's sales director for public-sector clients in Poland. He was arrested with a former Polish security agent who worked for Orange Polska, the local branch of a French telecom. Huawei dismissed the arrested sales director following the incident."

Huawei also intentionally and systematically sought to steal valuable intellectual property from an American company so it could circumvent hard-earned time consuming research and gain an unfair market advantage. [...]\n\n\n\nAs Americans, we should all be concerned about the potential for any company beholden to a foreign government - especially one that doesn't share our values -- to burrow into the American telecommunications market. Today's charges serve as a warning that the FBI does not - and will not -- tolerate businesses that violate our laws, obstruct our justice, and jeopardize our national security.\n\nNote: Due to the political nature of the discussion regarding this topic, the discussion thread is located in our Politics, Religion, Social Issues forum. All forum members and site visitors are welcome to read and follow the thread, but posting is limited to forum members with at least 100 posts.\n\nThe United States Justice Department today announced a series of criminal charges against Chinese smartphone maker Huawei for stealing trade secrets, bank fraud, wire fraud, and obstructing justice.In the first of two indictments unsealed this afternoon, the Justice Department accuses Huawei, Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, and two affiliates of bank and wire fraud.Huawei is said to have misled a global bank and U.S. authorities about its relationship with subsidiaries Skycom and Huawei Device USA to conduct business in Iran despite sanctions, conducting millions of dollars in business. Huawei is accused of lying to the government, destroying documents, and attempting to move key Huawei employees back to China to impede the investigation.A second indictment accuses Huawei of stealing trade secrets, wire fraud, and obstructing justice for stealing robotic technology from T-Mobile U.S. for testing smartphone durability.Huawei violated confidentiality agreements with T-Mobile when it stole information on \"Tappy,\" a T-Mobile robot designed to mimic human fingers to test smartphones back in 2012. Huawei employees secretly took photos of the robot, measured it, and stole components. T-Mobile won a $4.8 million lawsuit against Huawei in 2017 over the dispute.All in all, the U.S. filed 10 charges related to trade secrets for the T-Mobile theft and 13 charges related to sanction violations against Huawei. The U.S. is seeking the extradition of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou from Canada, where she was arrested in December FBI Director Christopher Wray said that the charges levied against Huawei \"expose brazen and persistent actions to exploit American companies and financial institutions and threaten the free and fair global marketplace.\"The charges filed today against Huawei will likely escalate U.S.-China tensions, though the Department of Justice said that the indictments are \"wholly separate\" from trade negotiations with China, which are set to continue this week.The U.S. has already banned government employees and contractors from using devices from Huawei and ZTE, and legislation has been introduced that would ban the export of U.S. parts and components to Chinese telecommunications companies in violation of U.S. export control or sanction laws.Huawei is the largest smartphone manufacturer in China and a major Apple competitor in the country. Few Huawei products are available in the U.S., however, because of the aforementioned cybersecurity concerns."

That date is 60 days after Meng was taken into custody at Vancouver's international airport.\n\n\"Relations between China and Canada soured after the arrest,\" NPR's Rob Schmitz reports from Shanghai, \"with China detaining two Canadian citizens and sentencing to death a Canadian man previously found guilty of drug smuggling.\"\n\nSchmitz adds, \"A group of 143 scholars and former diplomats have signed an open letter to Chinese leader Xi Jinping demanding the release of the two Canadians.\"\n\nMeng, who is also the daughter of the Chinese tech behemoth's billionaire founder and CEO, was arrested Dec. 1. U.S. officials suspect her of committing bank fraud while trying to circumvent U.S. sanctions on Iran.\n\nMeng was freed on bail of $10 million Canadian ($7.5 million U.S.) last month, after surrendering her passports and agreeing to wear a GPS monitor. She is currently living in one of the two houses she owns in the Vancouver area; her next court date is set for Feb. 6.\n\nResponding to news that the U.S. will move ahead with the extradition request, a Chinese government spokeswoman said it was a mistake to have arrested Meng.\n\n\"China will take action in response to measures taken by the U.S.,\" the Chinese Foreign Ministry's Hua Chunying was quoted as saying by the South China Morning Post. \"Everyone has to be held responsible for their own actions. Both the U.S. and Canada should be aware of the seriousness of the case and take steps to rectify the mistake.\"\n\nIn an interview with the Globe and Mail, MacNaughton said that when he discussed the case with U.S. officials, he made it clear that Canada doesn't relish its role in the international drama around Meng.\n\n\"We don't like that it is our citizens who are being punished,\" the newspaper quoted MacNaughton saying. \"[The Americans] are the ones seeking to have the full force of American law brought against [Meng] and yet we are the ones who are paying the price. Our citizens are.\"\n\nDays after Meng's arrest, China detained three Canadian citizens Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor as well as Sarah McIver. And just last week, a Canadian man named Robert Lloyd Schellenberg who had appealed a 15-year prison sentence in China for drug smuggling was instead received a death sentence.\n\n\"Canadian diplomatic experts believe those detentions are related to Meng's. And on Monday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau denounced the sentence handed down in Schellenberg's case,\" as NPR has reported.\n\nThe dispute is also playing out against a backdrop of large-scale business decisions \u2014 including whether Canada will opt to block Huawei's technology in building out a new 5G communications network. U.S. officials have repeatedly warned other countries that they should not include Huawei in their 5G networks, citing the company's possible ties to Chinese intelligence.\n\nChina's ambassador to Canada, Lu Shaye, recently warned that there would be \"repercussions\" if Canada excludes Huawei from the 5G work.\n\nHuawei has been under U.S. suspicion since at least 2012. The Justice Department says Meng, who was once a frequent visitor to the U.S., stopped traveling to the country in the spring of 2017, after her company became aware of a U.S. criminal investigation into Huawei.\n\nLast week, Huawei founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei held a rare briefing with the media in which he denied that his company helps China's government gather information on its customers. His company operates independently from the government and is owned by its employees, Ren said."

Huawei has long denied such charges.\n\nOn Monday, the US Department of Justice named Huawei and Wanzhou as national security threats, and announced that it had indicted the company, the exec, and two affiliates with bank and wire fraud, and charged Huawei with crimes including theft of intellectual property.\n\nRead more:US calls Huawei and CFO Meng Wanzhou national-security threats, indicts company and exec on fraud and IP theft charges\n\nThe indictment alleges in part that Huawei stole information pertaining to robotic technology used for testing smartphones from a T-Mobile facility in Washington.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Huawei employees violated confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with T-Mobile beginning in 2012 when its employees took photos, gathered measurements, and even stole a piece of T-Mobile's testing robot, dubbed \"Tappy.\" The stolen information was sent back to Huawei by the employees through an encrypted email address, according to the indictment.\n\nWhen T-Mobile originally discovered that its trade secrets were allegedly being compromised and raised concerns, Huawei claimed the employees involved in the theft were working as \"rogue actors,\" the indictment alleges. Huawei has said that it settled its differences with T-Mobile in 2017.\n\nLate Monday evening, a Huawei spokesperson told Business Insider: \"The Company denies that it or its subsidiary or affiliate have committed any of the asserted violations of U.S. law set forth in each of the indictments, is not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms. Meng, and believes the U.S. courts will ultimately reach the same conclusion.\"\n\nThe US Department of Justice did not responded to Business Insider's request for comment on Monday night."

    "text": "As the deadline to reach a deal rapidly approaches, officials from the Trump administration and the Chinese government are set to meet in Washington on Wednesday to try to end the US-China trade war.\n\nThe Trump team, led by US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, is set to sit down with a Chinese delegation led by Vice Premier Liu He, the country's top economic official.\n\nThe two sides are facing down a March 1 deadline to find an agreement that would put a permanent pause on the escalation of a trade war that has seen tariffs slapped on $360 billion worth of goods sent between the two nations.\n\nBut with a large agenda of economic issues to discuss and a growing number of noneconomic complications, the US and Chinese teams will have to thread a small needle to get a deal done.\n\nPressure on both sides to make a deal\n\nUS Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer is meeting with China's top economic official, Liu He, on Wednesday. Thomson Reuters\n\nThe talks between Lighthizer and Liu are the second major meeting scheduled between the two countries since President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping hashed out a temporary truce at the G20 summit in December. Midlevel officials from the two countries met in China earlier this month.\n\nAs part of the agreement, the two sides agreed to not escalate the trade fight for 90 days, setting up the March 1 deadline. After that date the US is scheduled to increase its 10% tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods to 25%, and Trump has threatened to hit the remaining $255 billion of Chinese imports with tariffs, too.\n\nSuch an increase would most likely cause major ripple effects in the US economy. Close to half of economists The Wall Street Journal surveyed in December cited the trade war as the biggest threat to the US economy.\n\nRead more: A simple chart shows the winners and losers from Trump's trade war with China\n\nWith the prospect of a major escalation just 30 days away, both the US and China have a lot of reasons to get a deal done.\n\nFor Beijing, the trade war is weighing on an already slowing economy. Internal factors such as high indebtedness are putting major strains on the Chinese economy, and the tariffs are not helping the situation.\n\nThe Trump administration is also facing economic concerns, and distaste for the trade war among key political groups puts the president in a tough spot.\n\n\"Republicans in Congress aren't going to find additional tariffs really a winner back home, and they are already facing concern in large parts of the country over the impact of the partial government shutdown,\" Mary Lovely, an economics professor at Syracuse University, told The Wall Street Journal on Wednesday. \"More tariffs and failure to get a deal will ultimately seem to people like further failure of the government.\"\n\nA long way to go\n\nTrump with Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and Boeing's chairman and CEO, Dennis Muilenburg. Reuters\n\nBut despite the pressure on the two countries to get a deal done, major differences still remain.\n\nThe US is likely to insist that China make significant changes to the way the country does business, such as eliminating subsidies for favored companies and cracking down on the theft of US intellectual property.\n\nBut the team from Beijing is expected to offer merely superficial changes to its economic system, while committing to purchasing large quantities of US goods to help lower the US-China trade imbalance.\n\nThere are, however, some encouraging signs the Chinese government is already taking some of the reforms that the US requested seriously. On Wednesday, Beijing moved up the timetable for a new law that would strengthen intellectual-property protections and, in theory, increase market access for non-Chinese companies.\n\nWhile the move is part of a broader internal reform plan, whether China is truly committed to its promises is a key sticking point in the trade negotiations.\n\nAlso adding to the difficulties is the lack of cohesion on the Trump team. Lighthizer has generally been more hawkish toward China, while the administration's free-trade advocates \u2014 most notably Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin \u2014 have supported a short-term deal to lift the tariffs.\n\nThese opposing ideas have previously complicated talks, and Susan Aaronson, a senior fellow at the Centre for International Governance Innovation, has warned they could do so again.\n\n\"The Trump administration still lacks any clear objectives, strategy, or metrics for success in its trade talks with China,\" Aaronson said in a statement. \"Without such a plan, they are sending confusing messages to Chinese bureaucrats and mocking what trade is about: mutual benefit.\"\n\nThe Huawei problem\n\nHuawei's chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, arriving at a parole office with a security guard in Vancouver, British Columbia. Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press via AP\n\nComplicating matters further is the ongoing argument over the US's charges against the Chinese tech giant Huawei.\n\nThe US officially submitted an extradition request for Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou on Tuesday, about two months after the executive was arrested in Canada on suspicion of fraud and of violating of American sanctions on Iran. The request came the day after the US also charged Huawei with the theft of trade secrets. Meng and Huawei have denied the allegations.\n\nBeijing immediately condemned the move.\n\n\"We call on the US side to immediately withdraw the arrest warrant for Meng Wanzhou as well as the official extradition request,\" the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told reporters Tuesday.\n\nWhile both sides have insisted that Meng's arrest is separate from the trade talks, the move appears to be part of a broader strategy by the Trump administration to combat China's growing influence in everything from economics to technology to international security.\n\nTrump linked the two issues in December, suggesting that he could \"intervene\" in Meng's case if doing so would help seal a trade deal.\n\nTrump is expected to attend a dinner with Liu on Wednesday night."

The company's phones are essentially locked out of the US market, as it suspects that the company could be a backdoor for the Chinese government. More recently, the US has been aggressively lobbying its allies to reject Huawei's 5G network plans.\n\nThe US has ratcheted up the pressure on Huawei in recent months against the backdrop of its trade war with China. Huawei's CFO, Meng Wanzhou, was arrested in Canada in December, and the US formally requested her extradition in January. The US also charged Huawei with trying to steal trade secrets from T-Mobile.

    "text": "The US on Monday charged the Chinese phone giant Huawei, Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou, and a couple of affiliates with bank and wire fraud and theft of trade secrets.\n\nThe two indictments are the latest development in a saga that exploded when the Canadian government arrested Meng in December at the request of US authorities.\n\nRead more: US calls Huawei and CFO Meng Wanzhou national-security threats, indicts company and exec on fraud and IP theft charges\n\nWhile the situation for Huawei is grave, the indictment outlining the charges of trade-secret theft makes for slightly comical reading, particularly where it touches on allegations that the Chinese firm attempted to obtain T-Mobile's trade secrets starting in 2012.\n\nAt the time, T-Mobile was touting a device-testing robot called Tappy, which comprised a robotic arm and camera that tapped new phones to test their responsiveness and catch any software bugs.\n\nThe image below shows what Tappy looks like, and this T-Mobile video features the robot in action.\n\nTappy, T-Mobile's device-testing robot. Tappy\n\nAt one point, T-Mobile considered licensing Tappy to phone makers like Huawei who might use the robot to catch software bugs earlier in development. In 2012, it allowed these prospective partners limited access to Tappy in its lab, where engineers could play around with the robot. That included Huawei, whose US engineers were able to test Tappy.\n\nThis quickly spiraled into Huawei trying to gather a bunch of information about the robot, as detailed in internal emails included in the indictment. Prosecutors characterized Huawei's efforts as an attempt to \"steal\" data on Tappy to develop its own robot, called xDeviceRobot.\n\nRead more: Chinese electronics giant Huawei allegedly offered bonuses to any employee who stole trade secrets\n\nProsecutors say the emails describe Huawei's Chinese engineers working on their equivalent to Tappy and pressuring their US counterparts to steal as much information as possible \u2014 and the US engineers trying to avoid doing any such thing.\n\nHuawei engineers pressured into information gathering\n\nAt the beginning of 2013, Huawei's Chinese engineers came up with a list of questions about Tappy for T-Mobile engineers. They also asked their US colleagues, who had access to Tappy, to take some photos of the robot and send them back, the indictment said.\n\nT-Mobile quickly grew suspicious. The indictment said a Huawei US employee wrote to colleagues: \"We CAN'T ask TMO any questions about the robot. TMO is VERY angry the questions that we asked.\"\n\nHuawei's Chinese engineers continued to pester their US colleagues for more information through the spring of 2013, repeatedly requesting photos of the robot and measurement data, the indictment said. A Huawei US employee bluntly replied that Huawei China should question Tappy's manufacturer, not T-Mobile.\n\nEventually, the US employee suggested that the Chinese engineers come out to see Tappy for themselves.\n\n\"I suggested HQ to send an engineer to TMO for a hands-on experience by playing the robot system,\" the employee said. \"I believe this would give HQ robot team a huge benefit in understanding TMO robot system from hardware and software, as well as operation.\"\n\nAt this point, Huawei's US engineers had asked so many questions that T-Mobile had complained. Here's an excerpt from an email from the US employee included in the indictment:\n\nUS Justice Department\n\nHuawei China persisted, flying out an engineer to sneak his way into T-Mobile's lab, the indictment said.\n\nThough the engineer had no clearance to visit the lab, two US colleagues snuck him in, the indictment said. The Chinese engineer was asked to leave, but he returned the next day and took photos and gathered information. He was once again discovered and booted, but he returned to China with the information.\n\nDeeply suspicious at this point, T-Mobile revoked access to Tappy, allowing only one US Huawei engineer, referred to in the indictment as \"A.X.,\" to test the robot. Huawei China continued to pester this engineer to send photos and information.\n\n\"No need for home to keep reminding me,\" A.X. replied to their email at one point, per the indictment.\n\nOn May 29, 2013, after Huawei China asked A.X. to provide detailed measurements of Tappy's robot arm, A.X. walked into T-Mobile's lab, took one of Tappy's arms, and put it in his bag, the indictment said. When T-Mobile discovered the arm was missing, A.X. gave it back, but the damage had been done.\n\nThe indictment alleges that Huawei China did everything it could to cover up the coordinated effort, saying that A.X. and the Chinese engineer had \"acted on their own\" and that the pair had been fired.\n\nHuawei says the T-Mobile case is settled\n\nHuawei said this whole episode was settled in an earlier civil lawsuit, and it denied any wrongdoing in a statement to Business Insider:"

    "title": "Unpacking Trump's 'American AI Initiative'",
    "text": "(Photo by Aude Guerrucci-Pool/Getty Images)\n\nPresident Trump today signed an executive order establishing the \"American AI Initiative\" to guide AI development in the United States.\n\nThe Trump administration released details about the initiative ahead of the announcement, and outlined five \"key pillars\" of the overarching US AI strategy, but details are scant on funding, timelines, and the larger geopolitical forces at play behind America's long-awaited move to establish official policy overseeing and governing AI development.\n\nThe Obama administration released a report in 2016 that covered factors such as automation and economic transformation, cybersecurity, research, and foreign policy, but stopped short of providing anything beyond a potential regulatory framework. The American AI Initiative is currently broken down into five core areas:\n\nFunding: The government will direct federal agencies to \"prioritize investments\" in AI research and development, but there are no specifics yet regarding how much funding will be requested and who gets it.\n\nThe government will direct federal agencies to \"prioritize investments\" in AI research and development, but there are no specifics yet regarding how much funding will be requested and who gets it. Government Resources: The initiative will give AI researchers access to federal data and resources such as machine learning algorithms and models to boost development and help researchers train advanced deep learning models and neural networks. The initiative commits to providing computing power in the form of cloud-compute resources to AI-related applications and research projects. No details are provided regarding where those apps will be hosted, i.e. on the government's own servers or through some sort of public-private partnership allocating resources from cloud platform vendors such as Amazon or Microsoft.\n\nThe initiative will give AI researchers access to federal data and resources such as machine learning algorithms and models to boost development and help researchers train advanced deep learning models and neural networks.

No details are provided regarding where those apps will be hosted, i.e. on the government's own servers or through some sort of public-private partnership allocating resources from cloud platform vendors such as Amazon or Microsoft. Automation: Massive changes to the workforce are an inevitability as AI replaces more human jobs and creates new ones. The initiative will direct federal agencies to prepare federal workers for changes in the job market and spearhead retraining programs such as apprenticeships, fellowships, and skill-based technial education. No specifics are given regarding specific industries or job types, or which federal bodies will oversee retraining efforts, but the executive order specifically mentions the importance of STEM education in building future workforce with AI-relevant skills.\n\nMassive changes to the workforce are an inevitability as AI replaces more human jobs and creates new ones.

International Engagement: The initiative calls for the US to work with other nations on collaborative AI development, but do so in a way that protects American \"values and interests.\" This point is all about reading between the lines, where you'll find a big neon sign flashing the word CHINA.\n\nThe initiative calls for the US to work with other nations on collaborative AI development, but do so in a way that protects American \"values and interests.\" This point is all about reading between the lines, where you'll find a big neon sign flashing the word CHINA. Standardization: Creating standards is an oft-discussed topic in AI, but internet standards bodies like the ISO and IEEE have only begun developing technical standards in the past few years. Otherwise, companies have largely been left to their own devices to determine what is considered an ethical use of AI. This initiative positions the US to begin dictating standardization policies around developing \"reliable, robust, trustworthy, secure, portable, and interoperable AI systems,\" through agencies including the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.\n\nWe got some more details on the administration's thinking in a Wired op-ed written by Michael Kratsios, the White House Deputy Assistant to the President for Technology Policy. Kratsios talked about an AI future of autonomous cars, industrial robots, and disease diagnosis, framed in terms of American industrial-type dominance over its development.\n\n\"As a result of our long-term emphasis on fundamental research and development, America has been the leader in AI from its inception,\" wrote Kratsios. \"The American AI Initiative will build on this success by leveraging our R&D ecosystem of industry, academia, and government and prioritizing federal investments of cutting-edge ideas that can directly benefit the American people. An integral part of the initiative will include federal agencies developing AI R&D budgets to support their core missions.\"\n\nKratsios said federal agencies will work with industry and educational institutions through the National Council for the American Worker and the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.\n\nOne factor not mentioned is how Trump's anti-immigrant policies are affecting research talent available in key tech fields such as AI, where professionals are flocking elsewhere in the midst of ongoing uncertainty with visa programs such as H1B. In 2017, 97 tech companies filed an order opposing Trump's immigration ban.\n\nThen there's China. Kratsios talked about \"winning the race for AI,\" but none of the US government's official messaging on the American AI Initiative have explicity named the world's other AI powerhouse, which launched a broad AI funding and development plan in 2017. Eighteen countries including Canda, Denmark, France, Mexico, Singapore, and South Korea currently have fully funded AI strategies in place, but none have the public-private infrastructure and hardware/software pipeline that exists in China.\n\nChinese software giants Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent have a combined market capitalization of more than a trillion dollars, and are only investing more heavily in AI. The big American tech corporations (Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, IBM, and Microsoft) stop the market capitalization charts and remain market leaders in AI investing billions of dollars each year in R&D, but China's state-run goverment allows for an unparalleled level of supply chain control. To reduce reliance on semiconductor importing and feed the demand created by its AI software companies, China is investing $47 billion in semiconductor production to meet the country's future goals.\n\nAmidst the ongoing trade war between the US and China, AI is one of the key tech frontiers\u2014alongside 5G telecomunications infrastructure and quantum computing\u2014on which the battles are already underway. The US has already taken definitive action against Chinese telco manufacturer Huawei, charging the company with dozens of counts of financial fraud and intellectual property theft. And Huawei execs including CFO Meng Wanzhou have been detained.\n\nThe President's executive order calls out China and Huawei in even more explicit terms, with a bullet point that reads: \"The President is also protecting our National Security Innovation Base against those who illicitly acquire America's hard-earned intellectual property.\"\n\nThe administration is also reportedly gearing up to institute a ban on Huawei technology in US wireless networks. The company continues to launch its own 5G tech, which the government is determined to keep far away from the 5G network deployments beginning to roll out across the US this year.\n\nHow the AI race plays out between China and the US has implications not in the global economic power dynamic, but for issues including cybersecurity, military-grade applications of AI, and ethical implications of tech like facial recognition and surveillance systems on civil liberties and privacy."

    "text": "Photo: The Canadian Press Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice is formally levelling 23 criminal charges against Chinese tech juggernaut Huawei Technologies, multiple subsidiaries and chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou.\n\nThe charges allege, among other things, that the company misrepresented its ownership of a Hong Kong-based subsidiary to circumvent American sanctions against Iran, and stole telecommunications technology, trade secrets and equipment from U.S. cell provider T-Mobile USA.\n\nActing Attorney General Matt Whitaker says the department is proceeding with its extradition efforts against Meng, who was detained Dec. 1 at the request of the U.S. upon arriving at the airport in Vancouver.\n\nWhitaker and FBI director Christopher Wray both thanked Canadian officials for their help.\n\nMeng's arrest almost two months ago touched off an ongoing diplomatic furor that resulted Sunday in the firing of John McCallum as Canada's ambassador to China after he publicly expressed confidence in her ability to fight extradition to the United States.\n\nNews of the charges comes just as the White House is making plans for a team of high-level economic advisers to meet a delegation from China later this week to talk trade between the two countries.\n\nU.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will take part in the two days of talks beginning Wednesday, along with the president's economic adviser Larry Kudlow and trade adviser Peter Navarro.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders says the two developments are unrelated."

    "title": "U.S. accuses Huawei of stealing trade secrets, defrauding banks",
    "text": "U.S. prosecutors filed criminal charges against Huawei Technologies Co., China\u2019s largest technology company, alleging it stole trade secrets from an American rival and committed bank fraud by violating sanctions against doing business with Iran.\n\nHuawei has been the target of a broad U.S. crackdown, including allegations it sold telecommunications equipment that could be used by China\u2019s Communist Party for spying. The charges filed Monday also mark an escalation of tensions between the world\u2019s two largest economies, which are mired in a trade war that has roiled markets.\n\nIn a 13-count indictment in Brooklyn, New York, the government alleged Huawei, two affiliated companies and Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou engaged in bank and wire fraud as well as conspiracy in connection with business in Iran. Separately, charges filed in Washington state accuse the company of stealing trade secrets from T-Mobile USA Inc. and offering bonuses to employees who succeeded in getting technology from rivals.\n\nThe cases \u201cexpose Huawei\u2019s brazen and persistent actions to exploit American companies and financial institutions, and to threaten the free and fair global marketplace,\u201d Christopher Wray, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said at a press conference in Washington announcing the charges. Separately, Canada\u2019s justice department confirmed it received a formal request to extradite Meng to the U.S.\n\nHuawei issued a statement that it had done nothing wrong in either case.\n\n\u201cThe company denies that it or its subsidiary or affiliate have committed any of the asserted violations of U.S. law set forth in each of the indictments, is not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms. Meng, and believes the U.S. courts will ultimately reach the same conclusion,\u201d Huawei said in an email. The company also said it had attempted to open discussions with the U.S. Justice Dept., but the request was rejected.\n\nThe Chinese government, which has defended the company and accused the U.S. of trying to curtail the rise of its technology industry, demanded Washington immediately revoke her arrest warrant.\n\n\u201cWe strongly urge the U.S. to stop unreasonably targeting Huawei and other Chinese enterprises,\u201d the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. \u201cWe again urge the U.S. to revoke Meng Wanzhou\u2019s arrest warrant and refrain from issuing a formal extradition request, to avoid going further and further down a path of mistakes.\u201d\n\nU.S. prosecutors said that Huawei concealed its relationship with Skycom Tech Co., a Hong Kong-registered company with operations in Iran, in violation of U.S. laws. Meng \u201cpersonally made a presentation in August 2013 to an executive of one of Huawei\u2019s major banking partners in which she repeatedly lied about the relationship,\u201d prosecutors said in a statement announcing the charges. Skycom was also charged.\n\nMeng, 46, the daughter of the company\u2019s founder, was arrested Dec. 1 in Canada on allegations that she committed fraud to sidestep sanctions against Iran. Meng\u2019s next court date is set for Feb. 6 in Vancouver, where she is out on bail following her detainment while in transit at the Vancouver airport. She is fighting extradition to the U.S. to face criminal charges.\n\nCanada\u2019s justice minister now has up to 30 days to assess the U.S. request and issue an \u201cauthority to proceed\u201d with hearings. The country has little leeway to refuse, assuming the alleged crimes she committed also violate Canadian law. A hearing could still be months away, and Meng will have several opportunities to appeal. The final decision on extradition is up to Canada\u2019s justice minister.\n\nCanadian judges end up approving about 90 per cent of extradition requests because the system makes it nearly impossible to mount a defense, says Gary Botting, a Vancouver-based lawyer who\u2019s been involved in hundreds of extradition cases.\n\nIn the Brooklyn indictment, the U.S. says Huawei misrepresented its business with Iran to the U.S. government and various financial institutions since 2007. That year, FBI agents interviewed Huawei\u2019s founder, identified in the indictment as Individual 1, according to the U.S. During the interview, Individual 1 falsely stated that Huawei didn\u2019t conduct any activity in violation of U.S. export laws, and that it didn\u2019t deal directly with any Iranian company, the U.S. said. Huawei was founded by Ren Zhengfei.\n\nCharges in the Brooklyn indictment include bank and wire fraud, conspiracy and violations of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. In addition, Huawei and Huawei USA are accused of conspiring to obstruct justice.\n\nTrade Secrets\n\nProsecutors also alleged that Huawei began a \u201cconcerted effort\u201d in 2012 to steal information from a phone-testing robot developed by T-Mobile USA Inc. and even offered bonuses to employees who could get their hands on the technologies of rivals.\n\nIn the indictment filed in Seattle, the government alleged Huawei violated confidentiality agreements with T-Mobile in an effort to build their own robot to test phones. A Huawei engineer secretly took photos of T-Mobile\u2019s robot, called Tappy, took measurements of parts of the robot and, in one instance, stole a piece of the robot, prosecutors said. Huawei then blamed \u201crogue actors\u201d within the company when T-Mobile threatened to sue, the U.S. said.\n\nT-Mobile sued Huawei and its U.S.-based unit, Huawei Device USA Inc., in 2014. Three years later, a federal jury in Seattle found Huawei liable for both breach of contract and misappropriation of trade secrets. First Assistant U.S. Attorney Annette Hayes of the Western District of Washington, whose office is handling the trade-secrets case, said Huawei\u2019s actions showed a pattern by the company.\n\n\u2018Steal Technology\u2019\n\n\u201cHuawei wanted to build its own robot, and rather than engineer its own device, it decided to steal T-Mobile\u2019s technology,\u201d Hayes said.\n\nThe Chinese company also obstructed justice by preparing a report claiming to be an investigation of rogue employees, even though \u201cHuawei clearly knew that the thefts were part of an organized effort by the company,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cDuring the time period of the alleged crime, Huawei announced a bonus for stealing confidential information from competitors.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how Huawei will respond. The company could appear in court and defend itself against the charges, as any criminal defendant might. Or it could challenge the U.S. jurisdiction to bring charges against the Chinese company, though there\u2019s no question that prosecutors have authority over domestic units, said Harry Sandick, a former federal prosecutor now with Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler LLP.\n\nIgnoring the case won\u2019t be an option, Sandick said, as that could result in a company becoming a \"fugitive\" entity that\u2019s unable to do business in the U.S."

    "title": "John McCallum: Huawei Executive Meng Wanzhou Has 'Strong' Arguments To Avoid Extradition To U.S.",
    "text": "OTTAWA \u2014 Canada's envoy to China faced criticism Wednesday for opining on how a Huawei executive might avoid extradition to the United States, fuelling speculation his remarks were a political ploy to end the government's diplomatic crisis with China.\n\nThe candid remarks by John McCallum, Canada's ambassador to China, marked a radical departure from the Trudeau government's firm public line that the extradition proceedings of Meng Wanzhou are an independent \u2014 and apolitical \u2014 legal process that must be respected.\n\nSpeaking to Chinese-language reporters Tuesday in the Toronto area, McCallum listed several arguments the legal team representing Huawei's chief financial officer can make in her defence. Meng was arrested Dec. 1 in Vancouver, at the request of United States authorities who alleged she used a Huawei subsidiary to evade sanctions against Iran.\n\nWatch: Prime Minister Trudeau pressed on his ambassador's remarks\n\nTopping McCallum's list was the possibility of political interference stemming from last month's comments by U.S. President Donald Trump that he might intervene in Meng's case if it would help him strike a trade deal with China.\n\nMcCallum also said she can argue against the extra-territorial aspect to her case and the fact the fraud allegations against Meng are related to Iran sanctions, which Canada did not sign onto.\n\n\"I think she has some strong arguments that she can make before a judge,\" McCallum told Chinese-language reporters in Markham, Ont.\n\nMeng was released on bail and is to live with an ankle monitor and a curfew in her family's Vancouver mansion pending the extradition process.\n\nErin O'Toole, the Conservative foreign affairs critic, said he believes McCallum's comments were approved by the Trudeau cabinet given they were his first public statements after briefing the Trudeau cabinet about the fallout from the Meng case at a cabinet retreat in Quebec last week.\n\nHe said the only outcome he can see from McCallum's comments is that doubt has been raised for the case against Meng.\n\nWatch John McCallum's full presser:\n\n\"That's pretty bad form for a Canadian ambassador,\" he said. \"I do think it was a political direction if you look at the timing of it.\"\n\nO'Toole noted McCallum didn't mention any of it when he briefed an all-party committee of MPs last Friday, the day after the cabinet briefing.\n\nMeng's arrest has left Canada politically wedged between China and the U.S., its two largest trading partners. The Canada-China relationship has plunged to new lows amid warnings from Beijing of serious consequences unless she is released.\n\nIf a Canadian court rules against extraditing her to the U.S., it would take the political pressure off the Trudeau government because it would lessen the need for Justice Minister David Lametti, who has the final sign off on the extradition, to take any action that could be seen as contradictory to the will of the courts.\n\n\"As criminal lawyers, we often say we've seen just about everything, well I haven't seen this before,\" said Ottawa lawyer Ian Carter, who represented Ottawa professor Hassan Diab in his controversial terrorism extradition case with France.\n\nTrudeau ducks questions\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau sidestepped questions about McCallum's comments, saying Meng will have the opportunity to \"mount a strong defence.\"\n\n\"We have always highlighted that Canada is a country of the rule of law, and we will make sure that the rule of law is properly and fully followed,\" Trudeau told reporters in Saskatchewan.\n\n\"The strength of our justice system is people get to mount their own defence. I know she will do that.\"\n\nA spokesman for Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland reiterated Canada's commitment to \"conducting a fair, unbiased and transparent legal proceeding,\" and said there has been no political involvement in the execution of Canada's extradition treaty with the U.S.\n\nLast month, after Trump's musing in a Reuters interview about intervening in the Meng case, Freeland travelled to Washington where she said such comments could prove useful to her defence. Canadian government officials who briefed journalists last month in Ottawa said the same thing.\n\nBut Carter said McCallum's remarks went much further.\"\n\nWatch: John McCallum says Canadian detainees in China a 'top priority'\n\nWhat's so different here is that this is a representative of the Canadian government that is essentially siding with the defence. It's just unprecedented,\" said Carter.\n\nIn the days that followed Meng's arrest, China detained two Canadians, Michael Kovrig, a Canadian diplomat on leave, and Michael Spavor, an entrepreneur, on allegations of endangering China's national security. China also sentenced another Canadian, Robert Lloyd Schellenberg, to death in a sudden retrial of his drug-smuggling case.\n\nThe Chinese government has insisted Meng has done nothing wrong \u2014 and has pointed out that she hasn't broken any Canadian laws.\n\nMcCallum was addressing Chinese foreign correspondents in an event that was not promoted to Canadian journalists. He said he was aware the Meng case had personally upset Chinese President Xi Jinping but he didn't know exactly why.\n\n\"Maybe it's because Huawei is a national flagship company of China,\" he said. It's not just any company, it's a special Chinese company. So, maybe that is why he is so angry.\""

Supreme Court in Vancouver on Dec. 7, 2018. Rafal Gerszak\n\nLawyers for Meng Wanzhou, the Chinese executive whose extradition is being sought by the United States, say they are actively exploring a defence based partly on abuse of the Canadian legal process, in which they would allege a political motive behind the U.S. charges.\n\nIn that defence strategy, and a second one \u2013 questioning whether Ms. Meng\u2019s alleged conduct would be deemed criminal under Canadian law \u2013 the lawyers say they will likely echo John McCallum, the Canadian ambassador to China fired last month after saying Ms. Meng has strong arguments to make against extradition.\n\n\u201cHe [Mr. McCallum] mentions some of the potential defences \u2013 and certainly, I think any person that knows this area would see the potential for those defences arising,\u201d Richard Peck, the lead counsel for Ms. Meng, told The Globe and Mail in a telephone interview from his Vancouver office.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cThe political overlay of this case is remarkable. That\u2019s probably the one thing that sets it apart from any other extradition case I\u2019ve ever seen. It\u2019s got this cloud of politicization hanging over it.\u201d\n\nThere was no immediate response from the office of Justice Minister David Lametti to a request for comment on Sunday.\n\nTwo Canadians have since been detained by the Chinese government, and a third, previously detained, has received a death sentence.\n\nMr. Peck, 70, who has practised law for 45 years, said the case is more politicized than that of former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, for whom Spain sought extradition 20 years ago from Britain for human-rights violations.\n\nOpen this photo in gallery Richard Peck, the lead counsel for Ms. Meng, leaves the court house in Victoria in 2008. JONATHAN HAYWARD\n\nUnder both Canada\u2019s Extradition Act and the country\u2019s extradition treaty with the United States, extradition proceedings are not to be used for a political purpose.\n\nThe question being raised by commentators in the media, Mr. Peck said, is, \u201c\u2019Is this case really about this allegation against the client or is it bigger than that \u2013 is it more of a politically driven case?\u2019 That could form in theory part of an abuse-of-process argument.\u201d\n\nThe theory is being actively explored by Ms. Meng\u2019s legal team.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe team has four core Canadian members, including Eric Gottardi, a partner in Mr. Peck\u2019s law firm; David Martin, also of Vancouver; and Scott Fenton of Toronto. They are supplemented by Reid Weingarten, of New York and Washington, and three of his colleagues at Steptoe & Johnson, a 500-lawyer international firm, which includes an office in Beijing.\n\nEach member has been assigned a task, Mr. Gottardi explained. \u201cOne person might be looking at double criminality [whether the charges would be crimes in Canada]. Someone else is looking at the political character aspect and some of these other issues people have talked about in the media, like Ambassador McCallum. I\u2019m trying to run those issues to ground right now, and bring them back to the group to decide which ones will be viable going forward.\u201d\n\nMost extradition cases are straightforward and result in Canada surrendering the person sought. The U.S. government, acting through the Canadian Justice Department, needs only to show that there is evidence on which to convict \u2013 a low bar \u2013 and that the underlying conduct would be criminal in Canada.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very limited process,\u201d Mr. Peck said. \u201cThe threshold is very low and the judge\u2019s ability to measure any type of evidence is minimal.\u201d\n\nBut in this case, Mr. Gottardi said, \u201cwe\u2019ve got quite arguable factual issues that go to some of the core principles of the Extradition Act. Whether or not the essence of the conduct that we\u2019re looking at, which is tied into sanctions violations, is even illegal in Canada.\u201d\n\nOpen this photo in gallery Defence attorneys Michael Magner, left, and Reid Weingarten talk to reporters outside Federal Court in New Orleans in 2015. Rebecca Santana\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has commented that he would drop the charges against Ms. Meng if it would help in his country\u2019s trade dispute with China. His comments drew attention to the political implications of the proceedings and raised questions about the willingness of U.S. authorities to use judicial proceedings for political purposes.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cSome of the comments by the executive of the United States we have to look at very closely in terms of how they impact the fairness of the Canadian extradition hearing and how easy it will be for Canada to adhere to the rule of law,\u201d Mr. Gottardi said.\n\nHe mentioned a news conference last week featuring the acting U.S. attorney-general, the director of the FBI and the U.S. Commerce Secretary as they announced the charges being filed against Ms. Meng.\n\n\u201cLooking at the press conference and the indictment and starting to gather evidence in the United States and Canada, we\u2019re starting to get the sense that this isn\u2019t a run-of-the-mill prosecution.\"\n\nMr. Peck noted that the news event came just before the United States met for trade talks with Chinese officials. \u201cYou shake your head and you wonder what\u2019s going on here. But then of course as a lawyer you think, is there anything here of value to the defence of Ms. Meng?\u201d\n\nNo date has been set for the extradition hearing. The next step is for the Canadian government to decide whether it will issue an authority to proceed. It has 30 days to do so."

Supreme Court judge and is due back in court on Feb. 6.\n\nU.S. authorities alleged she used a Huawei subsidiary to evade sanctions against Iran. She has denied the allegations through her lawyer in court, promising to fight them if she is extradited."

Kevin Frayer/Getty Images\n\nThe 53 pages of legal indictments released by U.S. prosecutors Monday sketch out evidence for charges against tech giant Huawei and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, the woman whose arrest in Canada at the request of the United States has brought intense attention to accusations of corporate wrongdoing by a Chinese national champion.\n\nBut between the pages of detailed allegations \u2013 e-mailed directives from China to steal U.S. technology; a corporate bounty offered to Huawei employees for the theft of competitors\u2019 confidential information; false statements from the company\u2019s founder to the FBI more than a decade ago claiming Huawei had not directly dealt with an Iranian company \u2013 lay the subtext of a shift with generational consequences.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty undeniable that the West, properly defined, has turned its sights on Huawei, and it\u2019s basically going to be shut out of most of those markets,\u201d said Andrew Polk, founding partner of Trivium, a Beijing-based business advisory firm.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cAnd the Huawei story is a very tangible example of the sort of deglobalization of technology, and the breakdown into Western and Chinese spheres.\u201d\n\nThe Dec. 1 arrest of Ms. Meng at Vancouver International Airport thrust Canada into a pitched diplomatic tiff with China, which has detained two Canadians and sentenced to death a third. U.S. prosecutors accuse Ms. Meng of fraudulently misrepresenting Huawei\u2019s business with Iran, saying the company violated sanctions against the country and, as a result, caused banks with U.S. business to participate in illegal acts.\n\nU.S. prosecutors have yet to secure the extradition of Mr. Meng, let alone marshal arguments in court.\n\nThe release of the indictment documents has brought new clarity to the U.S. case, in a series of charges against Huawei, several affiliated companies and Ms. Meng herself \u2013 23 in total. But it also marks a notable moment in a broader reconsideration by Washington of its economic and diplomatic relationships with Beijing that has global implications.\n\n\u201dYou absolutely have to think of it as the U.S. versus China,\u201d said Christopher Balding, a scholar at Fulbright University Vietnam who is an expert on the Chinese economy.\n\n\u201cThe very issues that are at the heart of this case are at the heart of the trade dispute between the U.S. and China \u2013 state-owned entities, intellectual property theft, subsidies.\u201d\n\nThe company has denied all the allegations against it, saying in a statement Tuesday that it \u201cis not aware of any wrongdoing by Ms. Meng, and believes the U.S. courts will ultimately reach the same conclusion.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nHuawei is already the world\u2019s largest telecommunications company and, some analysts believe, will soon be the largest smartphone maker as well.\n\nThe company can sustain its immense size through the enormity of consumer markets elsewhere, from dozens of developing nations where Beijing has gained influence, to the increasingly large middle class in its own home territory.\n\nOpen this photo in gallery Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, seen here arriving at a parole office in Vancouver, is accused of personally misleading banks about the company's violation of Iran sanctions. DARRYL DYCK/The Canadian Press\n\n\u201cHuawei doesn't just provide outstanding service, it provides stuff that's affordable. Why would anyone want to give up cheap, good service?\u201d said Zhou Xibing, a Chinese researcher who has written extensively on the internationalization of the country\u2019s companies.\n\nStill, the indictments were seen in China as part of a grand conspiracy.\n\n\u201dThe U.S. has smeared\u201d Chinese companies, \u201cand attempted to suppress the normal operation of Chinese enterprises. There is a political motivation and manoeuvring behind this,\u201d said Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang on Tuesday.\n\nHe dismissed the notion that the U.S. has now demonstrated evidence for the arrest of Ms. Meng who, according to the indictment documents, was personally involved in misleading banks about Huawei\u2019s violation of sanctions against Iran, through its dealings with a company it controlled called Skycom. Skycom used a bank with a U.S. subsidiary to move in excess of US$100-million through the United States., according to the indictment.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nInstead, Ms. Meng has come to be seen in China as such a victim of broader trends that Mr. Zhou described as a phenomenon he called \u201cMeng Wanzhou doom.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe U.S. has successfully shown the world the kind of destiny an entrepreneur is doomed to after entering the U.S. market,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening is \u201cwar,\u201d Mr. Zhou said, the opening volleys of a conflict between a superpower and its rising challenger that he expects to continue for decades.\n\nStill, the U.S. indictments offer an extraordinary look into allegations of wrongdoing by a Chinese company considered a national icon.\n\nThe allegations demonstrate U.S. concern about Huawei, particularly its activities in Iran, that long predates the election of U.S. President Donald Trump, or the massive imposition of tariffs on Chinese goods under his presidency.\n\nIn July, 2007, according to one document, FBI investigators \u201cinterviewed the founder of Huawei\u201d \u2013 Ren Zhengfei, the father of Ms. Meng \u2013 in New York. The personal involvement of Mr. Ren in answering FBI questions about Iran more than a decade ago had not previously been widely known. But Mr. Ren, according to the indictment, \u201cfalsely stated, in substance and in part, that Huawei had not dealt directly with any Iranian company.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe indictments also use detailed e-mail records to allege that superiors in China directed Huawei employees in the United States to collect information about Tappy, a proprietary phone-testing device created by T-Mobile. Huawei was struggling to build a similar testing device \u2013 called xDeviceRobot \u2013 and the engineers on that project sought highly detailed information about Tappy, according to the indictment. It quotes e-mails showing repeated requests for pictures and measurements, even though Huawei had promised T-Mobile it would not photograph or attempt to copy Tappy.\n\nAt one point, a Huawei employee smuggled home one of Tappy\u2019s robot arms, and took detailed photographs, the indictment says. At another point, it says, a Chinese Huawei employee travelled to the United States. and twice sneaked into the Tappy facility, using a pass for a U.S. Huawei employee, to photograph the T-Mobile robot.\n\nMonths later, Huawei launched a companywide \u201cbonus program to reward employees who stole confidential information from competitors,\u201d according to the indictment. Days later, the executive director of human resources at Huawei\u2019s U.S. subsidiary sent an e-mail saying that \u201cin the U.S.A. we do not condone nor engage in such activities and such a behaviour is expressly prohibited\u201d by local companies policies.\n\nStill, \u201cthe e-mail did not state that the bonus program had been suspended by Huawei China,\u201d the indictment notes. Indeed, the e-mail said \u201cin some foreign countries and regions such a directive and award program may be normal.\u201d\n\n\u201cChinese companies have been very eager to learn about Western technology in lots of different ways, and the Chinese government has helped them to do this,\u201d said George Yip, a scholar at Imperial College Business School in London who co-authored China\u2019s Next Strategic Advantage: From Imitation to Innovation.\n\nThe Western response to Huawei, he said, comes as Beijing starts to see fruit from its long-standing efforts to encourage domestic innovation. \u201cChinese companies are now challenging the West on innovation,\u201d he said. He believes the resulting frictions will endure for years.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201dWe\u2019re not going to have a military war between the West and China. But there will be trade wars.\u201d\n\nStill, he\u2019s optimistic that an accommodation can be reached. He expects China to further open its market to Western firms.\n\n\u201cTechnology affects everything,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I just do not see us having a commercial Iron Curtain between a Chinese sphere and a Western sphere.\u201d\n\nWith reporting by Alexandra Li"

    "text": "\n\nThe Canadian Press\n\n\n\n\n\nOTTAWA -- American authorities are facing a key deadline at the end of the month to formally request the extradition of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou from Canada to the United States.\n\nFriday, a spokesman for Canada's Justice Department said the U.S. had yet to file the required paperwork in the Meng case and stated the Americans have until Jan. 30 to do so. If the U.S. misses the deadline, lawyers with expertise in extradition cases say the door could open for Meng's eventual release.\n\nCanadian police arrested Meng at Vancouver's airport Dec. 1 at the request of American authorities, who are seeking her extradition on fraud allegations. They say she lied to American banks as part of a scheme to get Huawei business around United States sanctions against Iran.\n\nHer arrest has infuriated Beijing and the case is at the centre of an increasingly testy diplomatic dispute between Canada and China. The Chinese government says Meng has done nothing wrong and has demanded her release, warning Canada of severe consequences if it doesn't free her.\n\nUnder Canada's extradition law, the U.S. was given 60 days from the date of Meng's arrest to make its formal extradition request.\n\n\"The formal request for extradition (including the supporting documents) has not yet been made by the United States,\" Ian McLeod, a spokesman for Canada's Justice Department, wrote in an email Thursday.\n\n\"They have until Jan. 30, 2019 to submit this request. Canada then has a further 30 days to determine whether to issue an authority to proceed.\"\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice declined to say very much about the Meng case except that it's not affected by the partial shutdown of the federal government there. Thousands of federal workers have been sent home without pay because of a budget stalemate between Congress and President Donald Trump.\n\n\"We have no comment other to say that the current operating situation has no impact on our filing preparations,\" the department's public-affairs office said.\n\nGary Botting, a Vancouver lawyer with significant experience in extradition cases, said recently appointed federal Justice Minister David Lametti would have an obligation to discharge Meng if the U.S. misses the deadline.\n\n\"If it hasn't arrived in the 60 days then every journalist in town should be jumping up and down to insist that Meng get discharged according to the act,\" Botting said in an interview. \"That's what the act says... The minister must discharge them according to the rule.\"\n\nMeng's case, Botting added, remains in a \"political stage\" and won't go before the courts -- and into the \"legal stage\" -- until Lametti makes the decision to introduce an authority to proceed.\n\nMeng, Huawei's chief financial officer, is out on $10 million bail and is staying at her Vancouver home. She has been ordered to appear in a Vancouver courtroom on Feb. 6 to fix a date for further proceedings.\n\nLawyer Donald Bayne, who represented Ottawa professor Hassan Diab as he fought extradition on French terrorism charges for years, said it's not particularly unusual that U.S. authorities had yet to submit the formal request for Meng so late in the 60-day period.\n\nHe thinks they'll make the deadline.\n\n\"The Americans... having caused all of this so far -- would never be able to say with a straight face, 'Yeah, we've decided not to go ahead' or 'Gosh, there was nothing to our case,' \" said Bayne, who's based in Ottawa.\n\nIn the days that followed Meng's arrest, China detained two Canadians. Michael Kovrig, a Canadian diplomat on leave, and Michael Spavor, an entrepreneur, were taken in on vague allegations of engaging in activities that have endangered China's national security.\n\nChina also sentenced another Canadian, Robert Lloyd Schellenberg, to death in a sudden retrial of his drug-smuggling case. He was originally sentenced in 2016 to a 15-year term, but the court delivered the new sentence after reconsidering his case.\n\nWestern analysts believe the arrests and the death sentence are part of an attempt by Beijing to pressure Canada into releasing Meng.\n\nBayne said he doesn't think Meng's case would end even if the Americans missed their deadline -- but comments by Trump might do it.\n\nHe noted how last month the U.S. president raised questions about the basis of the extradition request by musing in an interview with Reuters about interfering in Meng's case if it would help him strike a trade deal with China.\n\nMeng's legal team could argue Trump's remarks, which essentially made her a \"human bargaining chip,\" indicated an abuse of process.\n\nOn the U.S.-China trade front, the deadline in the Meng case will coincide with high-level negotiations between Washington and Beijing, said the Chinese Ministry of Commerce.\n\nChina's Vice-Premier Liu He, the country's economic point person, is scheduled to travel to meet with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer in Washington on Jan. 30 and 31 for a round of talks. They will meet as their two countries are locked in a tariff conflict that's rattled the global economy.\n\nWith files from James McCarten in Washington and The Associated Press."

    "text": "\n\nThe Canadian Press\n\n\n\n\n\nWASHINGTON -- Canada's extradition of detained Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou to the United States to face allegations of violating sanctions against Iran will do little to ease China's diplomatic ire towards either country any time soon, a former U.S. diplomat says.\n\nWhile granting a U.S. extradition request would take some direct heat off Canada, the Trump administration's foreign policy of \"bullying and being bragadocious\" will only continue to erode relations over the long haul, said Brett Bruen, the White House director of global engagement during the final years of the Obama administration.\n\n\"The Trump administration has practiced -- not only with the indictment of this Huawei executive, but also with a number of intelligence officials and other foreign actors -- this policy of aggressively pursuing the enemies of the United States,\" Bruen said.\n\nThe repercussions, which so far appear to include the detention in China of two Canadians and a death sentence in the case of another who was convicted of drug smuggling, will only continue, he added.\n\n\"There is a boomerang effect -- there are American officials, American business executives and, clearly, Canadians who become the collateral damage, the consequences from this policy.\"\n\nChina again urged the U.S. on Tuesday to abandon its request for the extradition of Meng, who remains under house arrest in Vancouver -- including formal documentation that is due by Jan. 30 and which is forthcoming, American officials have reportedly told their Canadian counterparts.\n\nForeign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying did not mince words Tuesday as she excoriated both countries for what she called an arbitrary and unjust abuse of the extradition agreement between Canada and the U.S. that \"infringes upon the security and legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens.\"\n\n\"Anyone with normal judgment can see that the Canadian side has made a serious mistake on this issue from the very beginning,\" Hua said as she urged both countries to stand down.\n\n\"We all need to shoulder responsibility for what we do. The same is true for a country. Be it Canada or the U.S., they need to grasp the seriousness of the case and take measures to correct their mistakes.\"\n\nThe demand comes a day after 140 international China experts -- including five former Canadian ambassadors -- urged President Xi Jinping to free the two detained Canadians. The letter praises former diplomat Michael Kovrig and entrepreneur Michael Spavor as bridge-builders between China and the world, and said their detentions will make its authors \"more cautious\" about travelling to China.\n\n\"Kovrig and Spavor's detentions send a message that this kind of constructive work is unwelcome and even risky in China,\" the letter says. \"That will lead to less dialogue and greater distrust, and undermine efforts to manage disagreements and identify common ground. Both China and the rest of the world will be worse off as a result.\"\n\nChina detained the pair on Dec. 10 in an apparent attempt to pressure Canada to release Meng, who was arrested Dec. 1 at the request of U.S. authorities. A Chinese court also sentenced Canadian Robert Lloyd Schellenberg to death last week for a previous drug-smuggling conviction.\n\nMeng is Huawei's chief financial officer and the daughter of its founder, Ren Zhengfei. Huawei has close ties to China's military and is considered one of the country's most successful international enterprises, operating in the high-tech sphere where China hopes to establish dominance.\n\nMeng is living under house arrest in her Vancouver mansion while her case is under deliberation. Kovrig and Spavor are being held in Chinese jails and have yet to be granted access to lawyers, according to those who have contact with them.\n\nThe detentions and deteriorating relations have spilled over into talks on Huawei's push to build Canada's next-generation wireless networks.\n\nChina's ambassador to Canada warned last week of repercussions if the federal government bars Huawei from supplying equipment for faster, more resilient communications systems than cellphone users have now.\n\nWhen asked Monday about the government's ongoing national-security review of Huawei's potential involvement, federal Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale said there are other suppliers besides Huawei that can set up Canada's 5G networks.\n\nA Chinese foreign-ministry spokeswoman attempted to play down the earlier remarks by Chinese Ambassador Lu Shaye, who told reporters in Ottawa last Thursday that there would be \"repercussions\" if Canada bans Huawei from 5G work."

ALICE CHICHE/AFP/Getty Images\n\nCanada\u2019s envoy to China, John McCallum, apologized on Thursday for offering his opinion on how a senior executive of a Chinese telecommunications company could avoid extradition to the United States \u2013 a view welcomed in Beijing.\n\nThe ambassador\u2019s remarks to Chinese-language journalists on Tuesday drew calls for his resignation from Opposition MPs and criticism from former Canadian diplomats. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau did not directly address the issue on Wednesday, and on Thursday rejected the calls to replace Mr. McCallum.\n\nMr. McCallum had said Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd. chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou had a good chance of persuading a Canadian court to reject a request for her extradition to the United States on allegations of banking fraud relating U.S. sanctions against Iran.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nHe even suggested the Trump administration might cut a deal with Beijing to end the diplomatic crisis and allow Ms. Meng to return home in exchange for the release of two Canadians detained in China.\n\nMr. McCallum\u2019s speculation about the U.S. dropping its extradition request of Ms. Meng as part of a possible U.S.-China trade deal was taken seriously by top officials in the Trudeau government.\n\nAfter U.S. President Donald Trump suggested in December that Ms. Meng could be used as a pawn in the trade talks, Canada asked the Americans to ensure that two Canadians detained in China would be freed as well, according to a senior Canadian official, who was not allowed to speak publicly about the delicate discussions.\n\nThe insider said U.S. officials listened to the Canadian request but insisted that the Meng case was not part of U.S.-China trade talks and her extradition was a matter that should be left to the Canadian and U.S. legal and judicial systems to resolve.\n\n\u201cI regret that my comments with respect to the legal proceedings of Ms. Meng have created confusion,\" Mr. McCallum said in a statement late Thursday afternoon. \"I misspoke. These comments do not accurately represent my position on this issue.\u201d\n\nMr. Trudeau and his government had defended Mr. McCallum on Wednesday, declining to disavow what his envoy had said. One senior official, speaking on background, had even argued Mr. McCallum was trying to demonstrate to Beijing\u2019s rulers that Canada\u2019s justice system is fair and impartial and Ms. Meng would have the opportunity to vigorously defend herself.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau says firing Canada\u2019s ambassador to China would not help detained Canadians in the country. Earlier this week, John McCallum opined on how Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou might avoid extradition to the U.S. The Canadian Press\n\nBut commentators who are friendly to the Chinese government seized on Mr. McCallum\u2019s remarks on Thursday to bolster Beijing\u2019s assertion that Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest was politically motivated and aimed at harming Huawei, which the United States says is a threat to national security.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s obvious that Canada is taking a pro-China stance on Meng\u2019s case at this time,\u201d said Lin Hongyu, dean of the College of International Relations at Huaqiao University. \"The potential outcome mentioned by McCallum illustrates that, from the perspective of Canada, this is purely a political matter.\u201d\n\nThere are no indications Mr. Trudeau will seek the resignation of Mr. McCallum, a former Liberal cabinet minister who the Prime Minister named envoy to China in 2017 to pursue a free-trade deal with Beijing.\n\nHours before Mr. McCallum issued the mea culpa, the Prime Minister was asked if he intended to recall or sanction the ambassador. He did not answer that question.\n\nMr. Trudeau replied that his government\u2019s focus is on getting detained Canadians Michael Kovrig, a diplomat on leave, and businessman Michael Spavor home safely from China and ensuring their rights are respected.\n\n\u201cMaking a change would not help release those Canadians a day sooner,\u201d Mr. Trudeau told reporters on Thursday in Quispamsis, N.B.\n\nAfter Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest in Vancouver, China detained Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor on allegations of endangering China\u2019s national security.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe Conservatives demanded Mr. McCallum be fired, accusing him of intervening in a judicial process and bolstering the legal case of Ms. Meng, who is considered a member of China\u2019s corporate royalty.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable that Justin Trudeau will not hold his ambassador accountable for his interference in what should be an independent judicial process,\" said Brock Harrison, spokesman for Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer. \"Standing by the actions of his ambassador is in keeping with his weak leadership when it comes to China.\u201d\n\nDavid Mulroney, a former Canadian ambassador to China, said Mr. McCallum had eroded the Liberal government\u2019s claim to zero interference in the Meng case.\n\nMr. McCallum, who last year stated that Canada has more in common with China than the United States under Donald Trump, said on Tuesday that the extradition request has three serious flaws, including the U.S. President\u2019s suggestion last month that he could intervene in the Meng case if it helped trade talks with Beijing.\n\nIn addition to political involvement, he cited extraterritorial application of justice, and an argument that Canada itself had no interest in sanctions against Iran as potential defences Ms. Meng could use against extradition. He incorrectly stated that Canada was not a signatory to the Iran sanctions during the period of the U.S. investigation of Ms. Meng.\n\nNDP MP Nathan Cullen said Mr. McCallum had lost all credibility in Canada, and \u201cI would imagine now that he has apologized, in China as well, because, can he clearly say he speaks for the government with the Prime Minister\u2019s confidence?\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nGuy Saint-Jacques, who was Canada\u2019s most recent ambassador to China, said the Prime Minister must replace Mr. McCallum and find a way to resolve what he described as the \u201cworst crisis\u201d with China since Canada established diplomatic relations in 1970.\n\n\u201cOne solution would be to start the process for a new ambassador, but it takes a while for the process to select a new ambassador,\u201d he said. \u201cBut what is possible for the Prime Minister is to send a special envoy to China with a mandate to try to defuse this crisis.\u201d\n\nIn his statement, Mr. McCallum said: \u201cCanada respects its international legal commitments, including by honouring its extradition treaty with the United States.\u201d\n\nMr. Trudeau reiterated on Thursday that Canada is following the law and the Meng case will have no political interference.\n\n\u201cWe will always stay grounded in defence of the rule of law and the integrity of our justice system, which of course includes the capacity for people to defend themselves enthusiastically, which will be fully afforded to Ms. Meng and in her rights within the Canadian justice system,\u201d he said.\n\nSince Ms. Meng\u2019s arrests, China also sentenced Canadian Robert Schellenberg to death in a sudden retrial of his drug-smuggling case. He was sentenced in 2016 to 15 years behind bars. Canada has asked for clemency and called his death penalty inhumane.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nBeijing appeared to welcome Mr. McCallum\u2019s original remarks. Earlier on Thursday, Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Beijing has noted the comments, \u201cand I believe that anyone with normal judgment would see what lies at the core of this incident.\u201d Yet Ms. Hua showed no sign that China is prepared to deviate from the tone it has taken toward Canada in recent weeks, saying Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest is \u201ca serious political issue.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has been a serious mistake since the beginning,\u201d Ms. Hua added. \u201cWe hope that Canada and the U.S. can realize the seriousness of the problem and take actions to correct it as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nMr. McCallum\u2019s comments will \u201ccertainly be taken by the Chinese government as evidence to support its long-standing argument that Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest was a politically motivated one,\u201d said Sida Liu, an expert on Chinese law and criminal justice at the University of Toronto.\n\nThat carries a \u201cdangerous\u201d risk of validating China\u2019s response, added Peter Jennings, the executive director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, who has previously served in senior strategic and advisory roles to Australian political leaders.\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s all part of political strategy, it\u2019s perfectly legitimate for them to retaliate in kind \u2013 take a few hostages \u2013 because that\u2019s how things are done,\u201d he said.\n\nStill, at least one Chinese political scholar raised doubts over who Mr. McCallum was speaking for.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\"This ambassador in past years has always been nice to China and he is unhappy with the Trump administration,\u201d said Shi Yinhong, director of the Center on American Studies at Renmin University, who until recently also served as a counselor to China\u2019s State Council, the country\u2019s cabinet. \u201cBut look at the ambassador\u2019s words \u2013 he\u2019s contradicting his boss.\u201d\n\nJerome Cohen, an expert on Chinese law at New York University, said he would not be surprised if Mr. McCallum\u2019s words are repeated in the extradition proceedings against Ms. Meng.\n\nWith reporting by Alexandra Li"

    "text": "\n\nMike Blanchfield and Andy Blatchford, The Canadian Press\n\n\n\n\n\nOTTAWA -- Canada's envoy to China faced criticism Wednesday for opining on how a Huawei executive might avoid extradition to the United States, fuelling speculation his remarks were a political ploy to end the government's diplomatic crisis with China.\n\nThe candid remarks by John McCallum, Canada's ambassador to China, marked a radical departure from the Trudeau government's firm public line that the extradition proceedings of Meng Wanzhou are an independent -- and apolitical -- legal process that must be respected.\n\nSpeaking to Chinese-language reporters Tuesday in the Toronto area, McCallum listed several arguments the legal team representing Huawei's chief financial officer can make in her defence. Meng was arrested Dec. 1 in Vancouver, at the request of United States authorities who alleged she used a Huawei subsidiary to evade sanctions against Iran.\n\nTopping McCallum's list was the possibility of political interference stemming from last month's comments by U.S. President Donald Trump that he might intervene in Meng's case if it would help him strike a trade deal with China.\n\nMcCallum also said she can argue against the extra-territorial aspect to her case and the fact the fraud allegations against Meng are related to Iran sanctions, which Canada did not sign onto.\n\n\"I think she has some strong arguments that she can make before a judge,\" McCallum told Chinese-language reporters in Markham, Ont.\n\nMeng was released on bail and is to live with an ankle monitor and a curfew in her family's Vancouver mansion pending the extradition process.\n\nErin O'Toole, the Conservative foreign affairs critic, said he believes McCallum's comments were approved by the Trudeau cabinet given they were his first public statements after briefing the Trudeau cabinet about the fallout from the Meng case at a cabinet retreat in Quebec last week.\n\nHe said the only outcome he can see from McCallum's comments is that doubt has been raised for the case against Meng.\n\n\"That's pretty bad form for a Canadian ambassador,\" he said. \"I do think it was a political direction if you look at the timing of it.\"\n\nO'Toole noted McCallum didn't mention any of it when he briefed an all-party committee of MPs last Friday, the day after the cabinet briefing.\n\nMeng's arrest has left Canada politically wedged between China and the U.S., its two largest trading partners. The Canada-China relationship has plunged to new lows amid warnings from Beijing of serious consequences unless she is released.\n\nIf a Canadian court rules against extraditing her to the U.S., it would take the political pressure off the Trudeau government because it would lessen the need for Justice Minister David Lametti, who has the final sign off on the extradition, to take any action that could be seen as contradictory to the will of the courts.\n\n\"As criminal lawyers, we often say we've seen just about everything, well I haven't seen this before,\" said Ottawa lawyer Ian Carter, who represented Ottawa professor Hassan Diab in his controversial terrorism extradition case with France.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau sidestepped questions about McCallum's comments, saying Meng will have the opportunity to \"mount a strong defence.\"\n\n\"We have always highlighted that Canada is a country of the rule of law, and we will make sure that the rule of law is properly and fully followed,\" Trudeau told reporters in Saskatchewan.\n\n\"The strength of our justice system is people get to mount their own defence. I know she will do that.\"\n\nDavid MacNaughton, Canada's ambassador to the United States, expressed no interest in weighing the merits of Meng's case.\n\n\"That's a legal process. It's not a political process. It's not up to me to make that kind of a judgement,\" he told reporters in Washington.\n\nA spokesman for Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland reiterated Canada's commitment to \"conducting a fair, unbiased and transparent legal proceeding,\" and said there has been no political involvement in the execution of Canada's extradition treaty with the U.S.\n\nLast month, after Trump's musing in a Reuters interview about intervening in the Meng case, Freeland travelled to Washington where she said such comments could prove useful to her defence. Canadian government officials who briefed journalists last month in Ottawa said the same thing.\n\nBut Carter said McCallum's remarks went much further.\n\n\"What's so different here is that this is a representative of the Canadian government that is essentially siding with the defence. It's just unprecedented,\" said Carter.\n\nConservative Leader Andrew Scheer called on Trudeau to fire McCallum for the remarks.\n\n\"As a spokesperson of the Government of Canada, Ambassador McCallum's comments raise grave concerns about the politicization of this case,\" Scheer said in a statement.\n\n\"I call on Justin Trudeau to immediately clarify if Ambassador McCallum's comments reflect his government's position.\"\n\nIn the days that followed Meng's arrest, China detained two Canadians, Michael Kovrig, a Canadian diplomat on leave, and Michael Spavor, an entrepreneur, on allegations of endangering China's national security. China also sentenced another Canadian, Robert Lloyd Schellenberg, to death in a sudden retrial of his drug-smuggling case.\n\nThe Chinese government has insisted Meng has done nothing wrong -- and has pointed out that she hasn't broken any Canadian laws.\n\nMcCallum was addressing Chinese foreign correspondents in an event that was not promoted to Canadian journalists. He said he was aware the Meng case had personally upset Chinese President Xi Jinping but he didn't know exactly why.\n\n\"Maybe it's because Huawei is a national flagship company of China,\" he said. \"It's not just any company, it's a special Chinese company. So, maybe that is why he is so angry.\"\n\n-- with files from James McCarten in Washington\n\nWATCH: Canadian Ambassador to China, John McCallum, thinks Meng Wanzhou has strong arguments to avoid extradition to the United States. #cdnpoli https://t.co/CLZejTM9j0 pic.twitter.com/QhoWAdrJLT \u2014 Michel Boyer (@BoyerMichel) January 23, 2019\n\nWe just got a statement from @cafreeland's office about John McCallum's comments yesterday.

    "text": "Despite criminal charges in the United States and an ongoing diplomatic spat over Canada's arrest of its CFO Meng Wanzhou, Chinese telecom giant Huawei will probably continue to be an important player in telecom around the world, according to tech journalist Louise Lucas.\n\nThe Asia technology correspondent for Financial Times, Lucas says that while the United States and Five Eyes markets are important, they're by no means the only regions where Huawei has deals.\n\nChina-based Huawei has been under increasing scrutiny in the West over allegations of spying. On Monday, Department of Justice officials filed 13 charges of fraud against the company, Meng Wanzhou, and its affiliates in the U.S. and Hong Kong.\n\nOfficials at Canada's Justice Department confirmed that they received an official extradition request for Meng Wanzhou who is currently free on bail in Vancouver.\n\nAs the case heats up, Lucas told Day 6 host Brent Bambury how Huawei could overcome the challenges.\n\nHuawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou talks with a member of her private security detail, after they went into the wrong building while arriving at a parole office, in Vancouver on Dec. 12, 2018. (Darryl Dyck/Canadian Press)\n\nDoes Huawei need Canada, the U.S. and Europe?\n\nNot necessarily.\n\nHuawei infrastructure is used sparingly among U.S. telecoms, and in Canada it forms a part of Bell Canada and Telus's 4G cell network.\n\nHowever, Huawei has major deals with carriers in Asia, Africa and Latin America where it provides infrastructure and sells devices.\n\nWhat's more, the company has never been as dependent on the West as some might expect, Lucas says.\n\n\"In a sense, it's already effectively been blocked from the U.S. It hasn't been able to sell its kit to any of the major carriers,\" she said.\n\n\"The danger now of course is what the U.S. has been saying with the Five Eyes of Australia, New Zealand, Canada.\" The U.S. has recommended not buying Huawei equipment for fear China could use it to spy.\n\nThe U.K. and certain European companies have made some comments against Huawei, but they haven't sided completely.\n\nThe complicating factor is that European companies own or invest in some telecoms in emerging markets where Huawei is embraced. European sanctions could mean a move away from the Chinese company for those partners.\n\nEven if the U.S. shuts them out ... I certainly don't think they're going to disappear - Louis Lucas, Financial Times Asia technology correspondent\n\nWhat about parts?\n\nWhile Huawei isn't completely self-sufficient, they've opened a subsidiary, HiSilicon, to design their own chipsets, reducing reliance on companies like American-owned Qualcomm.\n\nBut, Lucas said, \"it still needs to go to a [fabricator], whether it's TSMC or whoever else, to actually make the chips.\"\n\nHuawei also continues to license patents from Qualcomm, meaning they require business deals with foreign companies.\n\nHuawei has their name everywhere. What's up with that?\n\nThe company has struck up many strategic deals to promote its name and brand.\n\nIt sponsors soccer teams, fashion shows and is a banner sponsor of Mobile World Congress, the biggest mobile technology trade show in the world, Lucas says.\n\nIt even sponsors university research \u2014 including some in Canada \u2014 and those deals can be murky.\n\n\"It's not always clear, because they say these things are private, what sort of agreements they have on patents,\" Lucas said.\n\n\"So, if there is an invention who does that belong to?\"\n\nA mobile phone made by Chinese telecom equipment maker Huawei is displayed in a store in Beijing on August 3, 2015. (Greg Baker/AFP/Getty)\n\nAre we at the start of a technological cold war?\n\nPerhaps.\n\nCountries around the world, including Canada, are currently soliciting bids for future fifth generation networks.\n\nWith Huawei a leader in 5G technology, it is vying to build technology in major markets \u2014 if countries don't bar the company.\n\nHow the U.S. charges play out may be a key indicator of Huawei's future.\n\n\"But even if the U.S. shuts them out, even if they [the U.S.] succeed in encouraging some places, or some places in Europe decide to drop them, I certainly don't think they're going to disappear,\" Lucas said.\n\nTo hear the full interview with Louise Lucas, download our podcast or click 'listen' at the top of this page."

The development comes after a joint Conservative and NDP motion gained Liberal support in a committee meeting Thursday.\n\n\u201cWe are requesting that an emergency meeting of the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and International Development be held to consider the current state of Chinese- Canadian relations and to hear directly from the Canadian ambassador to China,\u201d the motion reads.\n\nBut the Liberals had one caveat: that the meeting be closed to the public. Opposition MPs pushed back by requesting that a small portion of the meeting be made public. However, the Liberal majority on the committee quashed that option and ensured the meeting will be hidden from the public eye.\n\n\u201cWe should err on the side of caution. Lives are at risk,\u201d Liberal MP Borys Wrzesnewskyj said.\n\nChina detained two Canadians, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, in apparent retaliation for Canada\u2019s December arrest of Chinese telecom executive Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver. Meng\u2019s arrest was undertaken at the behest of the United States, which has an extradition order against her.\n\nThe Canadian Press reported in late December that the lights are kept on constantly and Kovrig is questioned three times a day, according to a source who is aware of the conditions of Kovrig\u2019s detention. The two are also allegedly being denied access to lawyers and have only had consular visits once a month since being detained in December.\n\nMeanwhile, experts have warned the China dispute is likely to drag on for at least a year.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that China will hold the two Canadians for at long as Meng is held in Canada, former foreign affairs minister John Manley and former CSIS director Richard Fadden told CTV Question Period host Evan Solomon during a panel on Sunday.\n\nAnd that process is slow, the former top-ranking officials said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s optimistic to think that our processes are going to actually resolve this for Meng in a year,\u201d Manley said.\n\nMeng is scheduled to appear before a Canadian court on Feb. 6."

    "text": "The government of Canada launched John McCallum\u2019s posting as ambassador to China with a fanfare fitting the country\u2019s first political appointee to the world\u2019s second-largest economy. Mr. McCallum is \u201cvery close to the Prime Minister and to me,\u201d Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland told a Chinese audience in August, 2017. \u201cAnd he is here so that you can have a direct connection to Canada at all times.\u201d\n\nNow, in dramatic fashion, Canada has reverted to the way things have long been in Beijing, with a career foreign service officer as its top man in China, after Mr. McCallum was suddenly removed Saturday following a series of remarks seen as sympathetic to the Chinese position on Meng Wanzhou, the Huawei executive currently on bail in Vancouver.\n\nJim Nickel, 59, becomes Canada\u2019s acting ambassador, a Saskatchewan-born diplomat described as a \u201csteady hand at the tiller\u201d by former colleagues. He arrived in Beijing last August as the deputy head of mission, but will now be thrust into a leadership role at a time of extraordinary tension with one of Canada\u2019s most important economic and diplomatic partners.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nFollowing Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest, Chinese authorities have detained two Canadians and sentenced to death a third, sparking a fierce row between Beijing and Ottawa. Beijing has loudly demanded Ms. Meng\u2019s immediate release, calling the case against her a political attempt by the United States and Canada to constrain a Chinese technological powerhouse. Prosecutors in the U.S. accuse Ms. Meng of fraud related to the violation of sanctions against Iran, and have sought her extradition, and officials in both countries have said the case against her is purely a legal one.\n\nBut Mr. McCallum last week publicly described what he called strong legal arguments Ms. Meng could make against extradition, including political interference by the Trump administration. He then told StarMetro Vancouver it \u201cwould be great for Canada\u201d if the U.S. dropped its extradition request.\n\nIn China, his removal stirred anger among those who saw the former Liberal cabinet minister as a connected and co-operative figure, a promoter of a \u201cgreat new era\u201d between the two countries and willing to say to Canadians what Beijing itself has been saying.\n\n\u201cMcCallum was merely stating the truth when he observed that Meng has a strong case against extradition, which he rightly said was politically motivated,\u201d China Daily wrote in an editorial posted Sunday night. \u201cAlthough what he said is 100 per cent true, his words seem to have fallen on deaf ears at home. Those who had attacked McCallum should feel ashamed of themselves,\u201d the paper added. It said \u201cthe political mess that Ottawa is floundering in could get a lot worse if it chooses to accede to the U.S. request for Meng\u2019s extradition despite the problems with the case that McCallum, among others, has pointed out.\u201d\n\nPushing Mr. McCallum from his post \u201cis really adding salt to the injury\u201d for Chinese authorities, said Victor Gao, vice-president of the Center for China and Globalization, a prominent Beijing-based think tank.\n\n\u201cIt basically reveals that the Canadian authorities right now are at the end of their wits, and do not know how to effectively deal with the Meng Wanzhou situation in a very honourable and decent way.\u201d\n\nCanada is better served to seek peace with Beijing than to pursue extradition of Ms. Meng to the U.S., he argued. \u201cHistory may actually prove that Ambassador McCallum has served the fundamental interests of the Canadian people very well, very straight-forwardly and very bravely in speaking out his mind,\u201d he said.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIn Beijing, meanwhile, the turbulent undoing of Mr. McCallum was met with shock and concern to the diplomatic community, raising questions over whether the departure could further poison Canada\u2019s relations with China, or whether Beijing might, as punishment, delay approval of Mr. McCallum\u2019s permanent successor.\n\nFor some Canadians in China, however, Mr. McCallum\u2019s departure brought a sense of cautious relief.\n\n\u201cHopefully diplomats can get back to diplomacy and de-escalate a challenging situation rather than creating more additional confusion,\u201d said Colin Bogar, vice-chair of the advisory board to the Canadian Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai.\n\nMr. Nickel, for his part, isn\u2019t saying much.\n\nOn Sunday, his first full day as acting ambassador, he declined an interview request at the instruction of Ottawa, showing a caution in his public stature that had in recent days eluded Mr. McCallum.\n\nBorn in Regina, Mr. Nickel grew up in various places in Saskatchewan, where his father served in the RCMP. Mr. Nickel first came to China in 1987 to teach English at Hunan College of Tradition Chinese Medicine. The following year he moved to the capital, to the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, where his teaching position afforded him a front-row seat to the student protests that erupted at Tiananmen Square. He was still in Beijing when soldiers opened fire on June 4, 1989.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nMr. Nickel joined the foreign service in 1991, and has been posted to Tokyo, Jakarta, and New Delhi, where he was Deputy High Commissioner. Before being dispatched to Beijing, he was Director General for North America at Global Affairs Canada in Ottawa.\n\nIn temperament, he matches the classic Canadian conception of a diplomat \u2014 low-key and diligent, said friends and former colleagues.\n\n\u201cHe is a steady hand at the tiller, with significant Asia experience and management experience at missions abroad and headquarters,\u201d said Gordon Houlden, director of the China Institute at the University of Alberta.\n\nHe\u2019s a \u201cvery capable guy: smart, level headed and approachable,\u201d said Stewart Beck, the president of the Asia-Pacific Foundation who worked with Mr. Nickel for four years while he was High Commissioner to India.\n\nAnd though he remains early in his posting to China, Mr. Nickel has been involved in some of the highest-profile Canadian files. He personally attended the Jan. 14 retrial of Robert Schellenberg, when the British Columbia man was sentenced to death after a single day of court proceedings.\n\nStill, observers questioned how much difference an individual ambassador can make in a country whose leadership regularly repulses foreign interventions by telling others not to interfere in its internal business. Even when Mr. McCallum last week echoed arguments from China about the politicization of the case against Ms. Meng, Beijing responded only by reiterating its demand for her release.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cWith or without McCallum, I don\u2019t think it makes a difference as I don\u2019t think he had any effect on the situation,\u201d said Michael Yen, a Canadian business consultant who has lived in China for three years.\n\nFor Mr. Yen, watching the events of recent weeks has been a dispiriting experience.\n\n\u201cThe public threats from the Chinese government regarding Huawei and these arbitrary arrests have shown me that China isn\u2019t an option for long-term business, nor for settling down,\u201d he said."

    "text": "China\u2019s ambassador to Canada warned that excluding Huawei Technologies Co. from its next-generation wireless network will have repercussions.\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Ottawa, Ambassador Lu Shaye said there is no evidence that Huawei represents a national security risk and he hopes the Canadian government will make a \u201cwise decision\u201d in allowing the company\u2019s equipment to be used in so-called 5G networks.\n\nThe comments came at a rare press briefing by China\u2019s top diplomat in Canada amid escalating tensions between the two countries. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s envoy to Beijing said Wednesday that China\u2019s international reputation is suffering as a result.\n\n\u201cIf the Canadian government does ban Huawei from participating in the 5G network then -- as for what kind of repercussions there will be I am not sure -- but I believe there will be repercussions,\u201d Lu said, through a translator.\n\nCanada is navigating what Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland has described as a \u201cdifficult moment\u201d with China, six weeks after the arrest of Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver on a U.S. extradition request. China has since detained two Canadians over alleged national security threats, moved to execute another for drug smuggling and mocked Trudeau in daily news briefings.\n\nLu said that Meng -- who is living a comfortable life while out on bail -- is innocent and the case is politically motivated. He also defended the detentions of Canadians, saying they weren\u2019t retaliatory and that China is a rule-of-law nation.\n\nBut the Chinese ambassador warned the feud was having an impact on trade relations between the two countries, though he expressed optimism talks on the file could resume once the conditions improve. The two countries had been holding exploratory talks on a potential free trade agreement.\n\nLu said he believes Meng\u2019s case should be resolved soon, and the Huawei executive will be released. In an email to Bloomberg, a Canadian justice ministry spokesman said the U.S. has yet to make a formal request for extradition and has until Jan. 30 to do so.\n\nHuawei already faces bans of varying degrees in Japan, Australia, New Zealand and the U.S. over fears that China\u2019s government could use its systems to spy on other countries. British officials are said to have concluded in their latest review that the telecom giant has failed to improve its equipment and software, putting U.K. national security at risk.\n\nTrudeau, asked in December about Huawei\u2019s potential access to 5G networks, said the Canadian government would exercise diligence in its decision.\n\n\u201cIt shouldn\u2019t at all be a political decision made on how we engage, but a decision made by experts and a decision based on recommendations by our intelligence and security agencies,\u201d the prime minister told reporters in Ottawa."

    "text": "\n\nThe Canadian Press\n\n\n\n\n\nOTTAWA -- Canada's strategy for navigating growing tensions with China is in disarray after Justin Trudeau fired his ambassador to Beijing.\n\nThe prime minister's office announced Saturday that ambassador John McCallum had been told to hand in his resignation -- just hours after he weighed in on a high-stakes extradition case for the second time in less than a week.\n\nMcCallum was quoted in a Vancouver newspaper as saying it would be \"great for Canada\" if the United States dropped its extradition request for Meng Wanzhou, the Huawei executive who was detained in Vancouver last month.\n\n\u2022 WATCH: Why is Huawei controversial?\n\nHe told StarMetro Vancouver on Friday that if the U.S. and China reach an agreement on Meng's case, the deal should include the release of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, two Canadians currently detained in China for what many analysts say is revenge for the detention of Meng.\n\n\"We have to make sure that if the U.S. does such a deal, it also includes the release of our two people. And the U.S. is highly aware of that,\" McCallum told the Star.\n\nThat comment followed a statement McCallum issued Thursday, saying he misspoke earlier in the week when he discussed Meng's case with a group of Chinese-language journalists in Toronto, listing several arguments he thought could help her legal fight against extradition.\n\nAt first, Trudeau stood by his former minister. But McCallum's statements put the Liberal government in a touchy position. Trudeau has spent considerable effort and political capital over the past month telling world leaders that because of Canada's inherent respect for the rule of law, Canadian authorities had no choice but to detain Meng, and that the extradition process was not political.\n\nMcCallum's dismissal was too little too late for Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, who had called on Trudeau to fire the ambassador as early as Wednesday, on the grounds that McCallum's remarks raised concerns about the politicization of the Meng case.\n\n\"Justin Trudeau should have fired his ambassador the moment he interfered in this case. Instead, he did nothing and allowed more damage to be done. More weakness and more indecision from Trudeau on China,\" Scheer tweeted Saturday.\n\n\"It should never have come to this.\"\n\nPaul Evans, a China expert at the University of British Columbia, said this is the \"most difficult and emotional moment in Canada-China relations in 30 years\" -- since the Tiananmen Square aftermath.\n\nThe arrest of Meng may have been the immediate trigger but damage to Canada was almost inevitable because the country was already at the mercy of two much larger global forces: The clash between Chinese president Xi Jinping's growing authoritarianism and U.S. President Donald Trump's aggressive America First agenda.\n\n\"We're going deeper into the rabbit hole of Canada-China interactions. We are at a moment when we really don't know how deep that hole will get,\" Evan said in an interview the day before McCallum was fired.\n\nTrust and respect have been thrown into question, and there's no more benefit of the doubt between Canada and China, he said.\n\nBy appointing McCallum to the Beijing post in the cabinet shuffle in 2017 Trudeau appeared to have the right person in place to push Canada's trade agenda with China even further.\n\nAlready an experienced cabinet minister, his biggest achievement was in the immigration portfolio in delivering on Trudeau's promise to bring tens of thousands of Syrian refugees into Canada.\n\nMcCallum also had strong personal ties to China. His wife has Chinese ethnicity and his three sons have Chinese spouses, something McCallum was fond of pointing out.\n\nHe also had a large Chinese constituency in his former federal riding in Markham, Ont.\n\nNow that political investment is gone.\n\n\"In this hypersensitive era, we're all hyperventilating. Every twist and turn in this story, every comment just seems to put a little more salt in a wound that is getting deeper and not healing,\" Evans said.\n\nIn a brief scrum in Ottawa, Scheer accused the prime minister of damaging not only Canada's international reputation, but its chances of securing the release of Kovrig and Spavor.\n\nHe said McCallum's initial comments raised the spectre of political interference in the Meng case, and that by failing to act immediately, Trudeau undercut his own assurances that the case would be handled independently by the courts.\n\n\"This is, I think, part of a bigger problem. And that is Justin Trudeau's approach to diplomacy, where he thought he could conduct image-over-substance foreign affairs. And now Canadians are paying for his mistakes,\" Scheer said.\n\n\"Canadians' treatment in China is being affected by this.\"\n\nThe PMO declined to comment on exactly what led to the prime minister's change of heart about McCallum's fate.\n\nIn a news release announcing the ambassador's resignation, Trudeau thanked McCallum for nearly two decades of service. He noted that McCallum served as minister of immigration and refugees between 2015 and 2017, during the height of Canada's effort to resettle Syrian refugees.\n\nIn the wake of McCallum's resignation, Jim Nickel, deputy head of mission at the Embassy of Canada in Beijing, will represent the country in China as charge d'affaires effective immediately, the prime minister said.\n\nWith files from Mike Blanchfield"

    "text": "The United States has backed Canada\u2019s claim that the death sentence awarded to Robert Schellenberg is \u201cpolitically motivated\u201d as China continues to accuse the Canadian government of being soft on drug crime.\n\nForeign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland and U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo spoke Tuesday about Schellenberg\u2019s case, according to a statement from the U.S. State Department.\n\nThe statement says the discussion included Freeland and Pompeo expressing \u201ctheir concerns about the arbitrary detentions and politically motivated sentencing of Canadian nationals.\u201d\n\nSchellenberg was sentenced to death Monday, following a second trial in China for being an accessory to drug smuggling. His first trial resulted in a 15-year prison sentence.\n\nThe timing and speed of the second trial have led to widespread suggestions that Schellenberg was being punished as part of an escalating domestic dispute between China and Canada.\n\nTwo Canadians, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, have been detained in China since the Dec. 1, 2018 arrest in Vancouver of Meng Wanzhou. Wanzhou, who is the chief financial officer of tech company Huawei, was arrested because of an extradition request from the U.S., which accuses her of violating American sanctions against Iran.\n\nMeng\u2019s case was also raised by Freeland and Pompeo, with the U.S. State Department saying they \u201cnoted their continued commitment to Canada\u2019s conduct of a fair, unbiased, and transparent legal proceeding.\u201d\n\nFreeland and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have been attempting to garner global support for Canada, and have repeatedly noted that they have received public backing in the dispute from the United Kingdom, France, Germany and other nations. Trudeau spoke about the issue with the leaders of Argentina and New Zealand earlier this week.\n\n\u201cOur government has been energetically reaching out to our allies and explaining that the arbitrary detentions of Canadians are not just about Canada,\u201d Freeland said Wednesday, while speaking to reporters in Repentigny, Que.\n\n\u201cThey represent a way of behaving that is a threat to all countries.\u201d\n\nFreeland said the cases of Schellenberg, Kovrig and Spavor will be \u201ctop of the agenda\u2019 for her next week when she travels to Davos, Switzerland to attend the World Economic Forum.\n\nCanada\u2019s courting of allies does not appear to have impressed the Chinese government. Speaking to reporters Wednesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said China is \u201cnot worried at all\u201d about mounting international support against the country\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cYou can count by the fingers of your hand the few allies of Canada that chose to side with it on this issue,\u201d she said, according to an English translation of her remarks published by the ministry.\n\nHua also reiterated the Chinese government position that Schellenberg\u2019s sentence is appropriate given his crime. China regularly executes citizens and foreigners convicted of drug-related offences.\n\nAsked about Australia\u2019s support of Canada\u2019s position, Hua said she found it \u201crather odd\u201d because Schellenberg was convicted of helping people who were planning to move methamphetamine from China to Australia.\n\n\u201cDoes the Australian side wish to see this large batch of drugs arrive in its land and endanger its people?\u201d she said.\n\nHua also pointed to online comments by Canadians which, she said, suggested that Canadian public sentiment was against provoking an international incident over a person convicted of a drug offence.\n\n\u201c[It] seems to imply that some Canadians are even more sensible than their leader,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cIf Schellenberg\u2019s sentence to death penalty for smuggling 222kg of drugs is inhumane and inappropriate, does that mean it\u2019s humane and appropriate to allow drugs to deprive more people\u2019s lives?\u201d"

BEN NELMS\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s weekend firing of Canada\u2019s ambassador to China, John McCallum, is drawing anger in Beijing from those who saw the former Liberal cabinet minister as a connected, co-operative figure and promoter of a \u201cgreat new era\u201d between the two countries.\n\nMr. McCallum was removed from his job Saturday after twice wading into the legal case surrounding Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, who was detained in Vancouver on an extradition request from the U.S. government.\n\nMr. McCallum\u2019s departure is another twist in the continuing diplomatic row between Ottawa and Beijing that began with Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest on Dec. 1 and the subsequent detention of former diplomat Michael Kovrig and entrepreneur Michael Spavor. Chinese authorities have loudly demanded Ms. Meng\u2019s immediate release, calling the case against her a political attempt by the United States and Canada to constrain Huawei, a Chinese technological powerhouse. Prosecutors in the United States accuse Ms. Meng of fraud related to the violation of sanctions against Iran, and have sought her extradition, and officials in both Canada and the United States have said that the case against her is purely a legal one.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nA senior government official said Mr. McCallum has undermined Canada\u2019s efforts to build an international coalition of countries to press Beijing to respect the rule of law and release the two Canadian detainees. The official was granted anonymity by The Globe and Mail because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly.\n\nThe controversy unfolded on Tuesday when Mr. McCallum first publicly described what he called strong legal arguments that Ms. Meng could make against extradition, including political interference by the Trump administration. He apologized on Thursday then told StarMetro Vancouver on Friday that it \u201cwould be great for Canada\u201d if the United States dropped its extradition request.\n\nMr. Trudeau initially resisted calls to fire Mr. McCallum and later accepted his apology. But in the wake of Friday\u2019s comments, the Prime Minister made the move. \u201cLast night, I asked for and accepted John McCallum\u2019s resignation as Canada\u2019s Ambassador to China,\u201d Mr. Trudeau said Saturday in a statement.\n\nOn Sunday, Mr. Trudeau continued to reach out to foreign leaders to seek their support to win the release of Mr Kovrig and Mr. Spavor and clemency for Robert Schellenberg, who China hastily imposed the death sentence on after he had earlier received a 15-year prison term for drug smuggling.\n\nMr. Trudeau spoke with Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nThe Prime Minister\u2019s Office said the leaders discussed the \u201carbitrary detention of two Canadians in China, as well as the arbitrary imposition of the death penalty on a third Canadian and the importance of the rule of law.\u201d\n\nMr. Trudeau has not given a reason for Mr. McCallum\u2019s firing and the PMO did not respond to a request for comment Sunday on the issue. However, Liberal MP Marco Mendicino, the parliamentary secretary to the Infrastructure Minister, defended the government\u2019s decision during an appearance on CTV\u2019s Question Period.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cOver the last number of days, John made a number of statements which were both unhelpful and did not reflect the position of the government. That\u2019s why the Prime Minister asked for his resignation,\u201d he said Sunday.\n\nIn an editorial posted Sunday night, the state-run China Daily criticized Ottawa\u2019s McCallum decision and defended the former ambassador.\n\n\u201cMcCallum was merely stating the truth when he observed that Meng has a strong case against extradition, which he rightly said was politically motivated,\u201d the China Daily wrote. \u201cAlthough what he said is 100 per cent true, his words seem to have fallen on deaf ears at home. Those who had attacked McCallum should feel ashamed of themselves... the political mess that Ottawa is floundering in could get a lot worse if it chooses to accede to the U.S. request for Meng\u2019s extradition despite the problems with the case that McCallum, among others, has pointed out.\u201d\n\nThe government of Canada launched Mr. McCallum\u2019s posting as ambassador to China with a fanfare fitting the country\u2019s first political appointee to the world\u2019s second-largest economy. Mr. McCallum is \u201cvery close to the Prime Minister and to me,\u201d Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland told a Chinese audience in August, 2017. \u201cAnd he is here so that you can have a direct connection to Canada at all times.\u201d\n\nTaking over as acting ambassador in Beijing is Jim Nickel, a Saskatchewan-born diplomat described as a \u201csteady hand at the tiller\u201d by former colleagues.\n\nMr. Nickel, 59, arrived in Beijing last August as the deputy head of mission, but will now be thrust into a leadership role at a time of strained relations with one of Canada\u2019s most important economic and diplomatic partners.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIn the wake of the firing, Canada has reverted to the way things have long been in Beijing, with a career foreign-service officer as its top man in China.\n\nPushing Mr. McCallum from his post \u201cis really adding salt to the injury\u201d for Chinese authorities, said Victor Gao, vice-president of the Center for China and Globalization, a prominent Beijing-based think tank.\n\n\u201cIt basically reveals that the Canadian authorities right now are at the end of their wits, and do not know how to effectively deal with the Meng Wanzhou situation in a very honourable and decent way.\u201d\n\nThe decision to fire Mr. McCallum has also angered some Liberals who believe the envoy was speaking the truth when he blamed the Trump administration for the Meng case.\n\nHerb Dhaliwal, a former minister who served with Mr. McCallum in the Chr\u00e9tien government, said the firing of Mr. McCallum and the arrest of Ms. Meng has set back Canada\u2019s relations with Beijing that Jean Chr\u00e9tien had cultivated.\n\n\u201cI think it was a big mistake, you know, Chr\u00e9tien worked very hard to build the Canada-China relationship and they have destroyed it in a very short period,\u201d Mr. Dhaliwal said in an interview.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nMr. McCallum\u2019s comments about Ms. Meng also threatened to damage relations with the United States and risked fuelling the impression that Ottawa was intervening politically in the case.\n\nIn Beijing, meanwhile, the undoing of Mr. McCallum was met with shock and concern to the diplomatic community, raising questions over whether the departure could further poison Canada\u2019s relations with China, or whether Beijing might, as punishment, delay approval of Mr. McCallum\u2019s permanent successor.\n\nMr. Nickel, for his part, isn\u2019t saying much.\n\nOn Sunday, his first full day as acting ambassador, he declined an interview request at the instruction of Ottawa.\n\nBorn in Regina, Mr. Nickel grew up in various places in Saskatchewan, where his father served in the RCMP. Mr. Nickel first came to China in 1987 to teach English at Hunan College of Traditional Chinese Medicine. The following year he moved to the capital, to the Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, where his teaching position afforded him a front-row seat to the student protests that erupted at Tiananmen Square. He was still in Beijing when soldiers opened fire on June 4, 1989.\n\nMr. Nickel joined the foreign service in 1991, and has been posted to Tokyo, Jakarta and New Delhi, where he was Deputy High Commissioner. Before being dispatched to Beijing, he was director-general for North America at Global Affairs Canada in Ottawa.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIn temperament, he matches the classic Canadian conception of a diplomat \u2212 low key and diligent, said friends and former colleagues.\n\nStill, observers questioned how much difference an individual ambassador can make in a country whose leadership regularly tells others not to interfere in its internal business.\n\n\u201cWith or without McCallum, I don\u2019t think it makes a difference as I don\u2019t think he had any effect on the situation,\u201d said Michael Yen, a Canadian business consultant who has lived in China for three years.\n\nFor Mr. Yen, watching the events of recent weeks has been a dispiriting experience.\n\n\u201cThe public threats from the Chinese government regarding Huawei and these arbitrary arrests have shown me that China isn\u2019t an option for long-term business, nor for settling down,\u201d he said.\n\nThe McCallum controversy will be front and centre when Parliament resumes on Monday.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIn a campaign-style speech Sunday, Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said Canadians are tired of the Prime Minister\u2019s diplomatic mistakes.\n\nMr. Scheer told a crowd of Conservative MPs and candidates that the Liberal government \u201chas damaged relationships with key allies and trading partners, backed down to [U.S. President] Donald Trump on NAFTA, and refuses to get serious about the threat posed by China.\u201d\n\nSpeaking a day earlier as news of Mr. McCallum\u2019s departure broke, Mr. Scheer told reporters that the Prime Minister should have fired Mr. McCallum sooner.\n\n\u201cThis is, I think, part of a bigger problem. And that is Justin Trudeau\u2019s approach to diplomacy, where he thought he could conduct image-over-substance foreign affairs. And now Canadians are paying for his mistakes,\" he said."

    "text": "Open this photo in gallery In this file photo an undated picture released on Dec. 11, 2018 in Washington by the International Crisis Group shows former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig. JULIE DAVID DE LOSSY/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe Chinese government has publicly rejected an argument by Canadian officials that interrogators in Beijing have violated the protections owed Michael Kovrig, a former diplomat detained shortly after the Vancouver arrest of a Huawei executive.\n\n\u201cHe does not enjoy diplomatic immunity. I think China\u2019s message is very clear,\u201d said Hua Chunying, a spokesperson for China\u2019s Foreign Ministry, in the latest high-profile exchange of unpleasantries in a deepening dispute with Canada.\n\nChina\u2019s conduct has \u201cbeen completely in line with the requirements of international law, including the Vienna Convention,\u201d Ms. Hua said Thursday.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nCanada has accused China of violating that 1961 convention, which establishes the rights of national emissaries operating in foreign countries. Among those is a form of residual immunity, which protects the activities performed by a person as a diplomat, even after they have left their post.\n\nChinese interrogators have violated that protection by questioning Mr. Kovrig about his past work, the Canadian government has argued. Ottawa has summoned China\u2019s ambassador to Canada to lodge an objection and demand that China either formally request a waiver of Mr. Kovrig\u2019s diplomatic immunity, or deport him.\n\nMr. Kovrig served at the Canadian embassy in Beijing from 2014 to 2016, but has since taken a leave of absence to work as an analyst with International Crisis Group.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau has raised alarm over China\u2019s treatment of Mr. Kovrig, saying Beijing has chosen \u201dto not respect long-standing practices and principles in regards to diplomatic immunity.\u201d\n\nFollowing the arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the Huawei chief financial officer whose father founded the tech giant, Chinese state security agents detained Mr. Kovrig and Michael Spavor, an entrepreneur who arranged visits to North Korea. Both men are accused of endangering Chinese national security and are being regularly interrogated, although neither has been formally charged. They have also been denied legal representation.\n\nEarlier this week, a Chinese court sentenced another Canadian, Robert Schellenberg, to death in a retrial for drug trafficking. In November he had been sentenced to 15 years in prison in the original trial. A lawyer for Mr. Schellenberg has said he will appeal, and the Chinese government has said its judicial authorities acted in accordance with the law.\n\nCanadian political leadership has, however, argued that China\u2019s \u201carbitrary\u201d conduct in the wake of Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest should be cause for global concern. Ottawa has marshalled statements of support from a series of countries \u2013 the United States, Germany, France and the United Kingdom, among them \u2013 while Mr. Trudeau and Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland have publicly denounced Beijing.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cOur government has been energetically reaching out to our allies and explaining that the arbitrary detentions of Canadians are not just about Canada. They represent a way of behaving which is a threat to all countries,\u201d Ms. Freeland said this week.\n\nThat strategy has sought to build on efforts in recent years by the Canadian embassy in Beijing to co-ordinate international condemnation of China, including through jointly signed letters raising alarm on human rights issues. Only by acting together, diplomats have determined, can countries avoid the individual reprisals that China has directed at places such as Norway and South Korea during spats with those countries in recent years.\n\nBut in the dispute following the arrest of Ms. Meng, the Canadian response has further inflamed Chinese anger, which it has directed at Ottawa in ways that have grown increasingly personal.\n\nLast week, China\u2019s ambassador to Canada, Lu Shaye, lashed out at the \u201cWestern egotism and white supremacy\u201d that underlies what, he said, were Canadian double standards.\n\nOn Thursday, meanwhile, Ms. Hua took specific aim at Ms. Freeland.\n\n\u201cI think your foreign minister was too rushed, and forgot to think twice before speaking,\u201d Ms. Hua said. \u201cWhat kind of threat does China pose to Canada?\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nChina has demanded the immediate release of Ms. Meng, who was arrested in Vancouver in response to an extradition demand from U.S. prosecutors.\n\nFor that reason, \u201dit is Canada, not China, that poses a threat,\u201d Ms. Hua said.\n\n\u201cWe hope Canada will realize that it\u2019s fine to be worried, but please think twice before speaking. This is the very thing that harms Canada\u2019s reputation and image, and it is not helpful for resolving the issue.\u201d"

    "text": "A federal investigation into Huawei Technologies Co. for allegedly stealing trade secrets from U.S. companies follows a long history of wariness and suspicion toward the Chinese telecommunications giant.\n\nIt also adds to a case the U.S. has been trying to make for years now: Huawei is a threat to national security.\n\nThe investigation -- tied to civil suits filed in Washington state, including a 2014 case involving the theft of T-Mobile US Inc. technology -- ratchets up pressure on a company already reeling. Last month, at the behest of the U.S., Canadian authorities arrested Huawei\u2019s Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou on fraud charges linked to Iran trade-sanction violations.\n\nU.S. officials and industry executives have long harbored questions about Huawei\u2019s ties to China\u2019s government, and concerns about its technology have mounted in lockstep with its growing success. China\u2019s rise as an economic and military competitor to the U.S. have only intensified those worries.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration has pushed European allies to block Huawei from telecom networks, and slapped tariffs on China in part to limit its access to next-generation technologies. American lawmakers on Wednesday introduced a bipartisan bill that would ban the export of U.S. components to Huawei and other Chinese telecom operators deemed to have violated American laws or sanctions.\n\nHuawei holds an ever-growing share of the world\u2019s smartphone market and is a frontrunner in the race to develop next-generation wireless equipment, which critics say could enable Chinese spying efforts. The federal investigation and Meng\u2019s detention may point to U.S. efforts to build a public case against the company.\n\n\u201cThis is another prong in what is starting to feel like a full 360-degree assault on the business,\u201d said Isaac Stone Fish, a senior fellow at the Asia Society in New York. \u201cHuawei is a sustained target, and the U.S. government is saying Huawei is a dangerous company and should be stopped,\u201d he said.\n\nThe investigation is at an advanced stage and an indictment could come soon, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the information is private. The probe was reported earlier Wednesday by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nEmily Langlie, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in Seattle, declined to comment, as did a spokeswoman for T-Mobile.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not going to comment on such reports in the press,\u201d Chase Skinner, a spokesman for Huawei, said late Wednesday.\n\nChina\u2019s foreign ministry said Thursday the legal dispute between Huawei and T-Mobile had already been resolved, and expressed concern about the \u201creinvestigation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe seriously doubt the true motives behind it,\u201d Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the ministry, told reporters in Beijing. \u201cWe hope the U.S. can create a fair competitive environment for Chinese enterprises operating in the U.S.\u201d\n\n\u2018Hysteria\u2019\n\nShe also blasted U.S. legislators for proposals to block sales of American components to Chinese telecom companies, saying it amounted to \u201chysteria.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole world is quite clear that the U.S. is using national machinery to suppress China\u2019s high-tech companies,\u201d Hua said. \u201cThis is not what the No. 1 world power should do.\u201d\n\nThe arrest of a Huawei employee in Poland last week underscored the increasing pressure on the company in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere over espionage concerns. In 2012, congressional committees and other U.S. government entities criticized Huawei\u2019s \u201cpattern of disregard for the intellectual property rights of other entities and companies in the U.S.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, Huawei\u2019s billionaire founder Ren Zhengfei broke years of silence to dismiss U.S. accusations that the company helps spy for China\u2019s government. He also praised Trump for helping business by cutting taxes, and called Huawei \u201conly a sesame seed\u201d in the wider U.S.-China trade fight.\n\nThe company is also mired in a U.S. criminal case alleging that CFO Meng conspired to defraud banks into unwittingly clearing transactions linked to Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions.\n\nMeng, the daughter of Ren, was arrested in Canada on Dec. 1 and released on bail four weeks ago. She is awaiting extradition hearings to the U.S. while living under restrictions in her Vancouver home.\n\nHuawei isn\u2019t the only target. For at least three White House administrations, the U.S. has threatened to take new measures to punish China for the theft of American intellectual property. In November, the Justice Department announced its \u201cChina Initiative\u201d designed to prioritize trade-theft cases and litigate them as quickly as possible.\n\nThe first companies indicted under the program were state-owned Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co., based in Jinjiang, China, and its Taiwan-based partner United Microelectronics Corp. The prosecution of Jinhua has already helped to hobble China\u2019s aspirations of mass producing dynamic random access memory, or DRAM, chips.\n\nJinhua and UMC have pleaded not guilty to the charges. Three Taiwanese nationals were charged alongside the companies with conspiring to steal trade secrets. They are scheduled to be arraigned next month.\n\n\u2018Tappy\u2019\n\nThe U.S. probe into Huawei includes allegations from a 2014 lawsuit by T-Mobile, its U.S. partner at the time, that it stole information, according to the person familiar with the matter.\n\nAccording to T-Mobile, one of Huawei\u2019s engineers visited its Bellevue, Washington, lab to see a diagnostic robot called \u201cTappy,\u201d which simulated a phone user\u2019s use. T-Mobile alleged a Huawei engineer was curious about Tappy\u2019s fingertips so he slipped one into his laptop bag during the visit and left with it.\n\nT-Mobile said that days before the Huawei engineer took the part, a Huawei employee working at T-Mobile\u2019s lab took unauthorized photos of the testing robot with his mobile phone, in violation of lab prohibitions.\n\nThe jury sided with T-Mobile in 2017, saying T-Mobile should get US$4.8 million in damages for breach of contract."

    "title": "Australian's detention in China 'directly linked to the Huawei case': friend",
    "text": "\n\nRod McGuirk, The Associated Press\n\n\n\n\n\nCANBERRA, Australia -- Australia on Thursday urged China to treat a Chinese-Australian writer fairly and transparently almost a week after he was detained in what a friend suspects is part of a backlash against Canada's arrest of a top Chinese telecommunications executive.\n\nSpy novelist and online commentator Yang Hengjun was a Chinese diplomat before he became an Australian citizen. Friends say the 53-year-old had been living in New York as a visiting scholar at Columbia University and had returned to China last week with his wife, Yuan Rui Juan, and 14-year-old stepdaughter.\n\nForeign Minister Marise Payne said Chinese authorities notified the Australian Embassy in Beijing on Wednesday night that they had detained Yang.\n\n\"We will continue to make representations to China to ensure that this matter is dealt with transparently and fairly,\" Payne said in a statement.\n\n\"Our embassy in Beijing will meet with Chinese authorities this morning to seek further clarification of the nature of this detention and to arrange consular access at the earliest possible opportunity, in accordance with the bilateral consular agreement,\" she added.\n\nOpposition leader Bill Shorten, whom opinion polls suggest will become prime minister at general election due by May, criticized China for failing to notify Australia within three days that an Australian had been detained, as stipulated by the consular agreement.\n\n\"It's surprising and concerning,\" Shorten told reporters.\n\nYang's friend, University of Technology Sydney academic Feng Chongyi, said he believes Yang is being detained in Beijing by the Ministry of State Security on suspicion of espionage.\n\nThe detention comes a month after China's detention of two Canadians, entrepreneur Michael Spavor and former diplomat Michael Kovrig, in what was widely seen as retaliation for Canada's arrest of Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou at the request of the United States.\n\nFeng, who has been in contact with Yang's family and friends, said Yang's detention was \"directly linked to the Huawei case.\"\n\nFeng said he had warned Yang against travelling to China in light of the Canadians' arrest. Yang had argued that he was safe because he had flown to China several times since taking the university job in New York in 2016.\n\n\"I told him the situation had changed. He didn't believe me. It was a horrible misjudgment,\" Feng said.\n\nFeng was detained in China in 2017 near the end of a three-week trip during which he was researching human rights lawyers, and he was questioned by security services for two weeks before he was allowed to return to Australia. He said on his return to Sydney that he was unable to discuss the details of his experience.\n\nRory Medcalf, head of the Australian National University's National Security College, had warned after the Canadians were detained that an Australian could be the next victim of \"China's hostage-taking.\"\n\n\"It's hard to tell the precise reason for this detention,\" Medcalf said. \"I think rather it's a signal that we're now -- not only Australia, but really all democracies, all middle powers -- are in for a period of sustained tension with China where the safety of our nationals in China simply cannot be assured.\"\n\nYang's detention comes ahead of a visit by Defence Minister Christopher Pyne to China on Thursday. Pyne left Australia on Tuesday for a weeklong visit to Japan, then China and Singapore.\n\nColumbia University said Yang had been a visiting scholar with the School of International Public Affairs' Institute for the Study of Human Rights since 2016. Spokeswoman Caroline Adelman said the university had no comment on Yang's detention."

    "title": "Canada's Huawei 5G decision said to be months away",
    "text": "Justin Trudeau\u2019s government is still conducting its security review of 5G telecommunications systems and is months away from a decision on whether to restrict Huawei Technologies Co., people familiar with the plans say.\n\nCanadian security agencies continue to study the issue, including what potential security vulnerabilities exist, the people said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren\u2019t authorized to discuss the issue publicly. That review could lead to a particular company, such as Huawei, being restricted or banned.\n\nThe people are divided on how soon a decision will come. One said it\u2019s expected before Trudeau seeks a second mandate in October\u2019s election, while another said they expected it by the end of March. Another ruled out anything in the coming weeks, while several stressed that the timing remains fluid.\n\nCanada\u2019s review of the new, ultra-fast wireless network technology is drawing heightened interest amid an escalating diplomatic feud sparked by the arrest -- at the request of the U.S. -- of Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou on Dec. 1 in Vancouver. While Meng is free on bail pending her next hearing, China has since seized two Canadians, including a diplomat on leave from the foreign service, and sentenced a third to death.\n\nOther so-called Five Eyes countries including the U.S. and Australia have placed restrictions on Huawei\u2019s operations given its close ties to the Chinese government, moves that place pressure on Canada to make a decision.\n\nOfficials are conducting two separate reviews related to rolling out 5G technology: one for allocating spectrum, and another on national security. The government isn\u2019t accelerating or slowing either track amid the feud with China, the people said. The reviews also won\u2019t necessarily be completed, or ruled on by Trudeau\u2019s government, at the same time, they said.\n\nHAVE YOUR SAY Should Huawei technology be allowed in Canada\u2019s 5G telecom infrastructure? Results Total Results: 0\n\n\u201cThe process is obviously ongoing, we are examining the security issues as well as the technical issues with a great deal of care. We\u2019ve made it abundantly clear that we will not compromise national security,\u201d Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale told reporters Friday at a cabinet retreat in Sherbrooke, Quebec.\n\n\u201cWe understand the urgency of the situation, but as we go through the decision-making process, and making sure we have all the information necessary to take those decisions properly, we will not compromise,\u201d he said.\n\nChina\u2019s ambassador to Canada, Lu Shaye, warned Thursday that Canada would face consequences if it prevents telecom firms from using Huawei equipment.\n\n\u201cIf the Canadian government does ban Huawei from participating in the 5G network, then as for what kind of repercussions there will be, I am not sure, but I believe there will be repercussions,\u2019\u2019 Lu told reporters invited to Beijing\u2019s embassy in Ottawa for a rare press briefing.\n\nGoodale shrugged off that warning, saying a similar one had been made to Australia. \u201cThose sorts of comments will be made in the process, but we will make our judgment based on what\u2019s right for Canada and not be deterred from making the right decision,\u201d he said Friday.\n\nHuawei is racing to partner with Canadian telecom companies to develop 5G, the fifth-generation mobile network that could be 100 times faster than current technology and spur breakthrough advances in such things as autonomous vehicles. The Chinese firm also supplies some Canadian operators with older generation equipment. Huawei is already the third-biggest supplier to Vancouver-based Telus Corp., one of Canada\u2019s top three network carriers, according to supply chain data compiled by Bloomberg. The Chinese firm has also worked with BCE Inc.\u2019s Bell Canada.\n\nRoyal Bank of Canada is expecting Huawei to be barred from the 5G network but not existing ones. \u201cWe would expect any such boycott and subsequent \u2018rip and replace\u2019 to apply to 5G equipment only, leaving most 3G and 4G equipment intact,\u201d RBC Capital Markets analysts Drew McReynolds and Caleb Ho said in a note this month.\n\nEliminating Huawei, a major low-cost equipment supplier, could increase the risk of higher prices for Canadian telecom operators, RBC said, though \u201cany such cost inflation can be mitigated by each operator altering the pace of what will be a long multi-year 5G deployment.\u201d\n\nTrudeau\u2019s government has floated the idea of re-allocating spectrum -- the airwaves for wireless signals -- to accommodate 5G, hearing input from telecom companies and others. Some have warned that would hurt rural service. \u201cWe are reviewing the submissions. No decisions have be made,\u201d Danielle Keenan, a spokeswoman for Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains, said in an email.\n\nChina detained two Canadians -- Michael Kovrig, on leave from his foreign service job in Hong Kong to work for the International Crisis Group, and Michael Spavor, an entrepreneur who ran tours into North Korea -- on Dec. 10, nine days after Meng\u2019s arrest.\n\nA third man, Robert Schellenberg, saw his sentence in a drug case increased to the death penalty, rather than a prison term. Canada opposes the death penalty on principle, Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said Thursday. She\u2019s pushing for the release of Kovrig and Spavor, and for clemency for Schellenberg.\n\nKovrig\u2019s case is considered particularly galling for the Canadian government, the people said. While he\u2019s not a diplomat currently, he\u2019s being questioned about his activities while working for the Canadian government, the people said."

    "text": "TORONTO \u2014 Canada's national game \u2014 brought to you by China's Huawei.\n\nAs a nasty diplomatic feud deepens between the two countries over the tech company, involving arrests and execution orders, it hasn't gone unnoticed that Huawei's bright red fan-shaped logo is plastered prominently on the set of \"Hockey Night in Canada.\" TV hosts regularly remind the 1.8 million weekly viewers that program segments are \"presented by Huawei smartphones.\"\n\nThe cheery corporate message contrasts with the standoff over the arrest of Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. warrant. In what looks like retaliation, China detained two Canadians and plans to execute a third \u2014 heavy-handed tactics that, because they leave some Canadians with the impression the privately owned company is an arm of the Chinese government, give its sponsorship a surreal quality.\n\nThe TV deal is one of many examples of how Huawei, the world's biggest telecom gear producer and one of the top smartphone makers, has embarked on a global push to win consumers and burnish its brand. It sponsors Australian rugb y, funds research at universities around the world, and brings foreign students to China for technical training. It has promoted classical music concerts in Europe and donated pianos to New Zealand schools .\n\nIts efforts are now threatened by the dispute with Canada and U.S. accusations that it could help China's authoritarian government spy on people around the world.\n\n\"Huawei's marketing plan up until Dec. 1 (when Meng was arrested) was working very well,\" said Guy Saint-Jacques, a former Canadian ambassador to China. Now, \"public opinion is changing toward China and Huawei.\"\n\nAt stake for Huawei are lucrative contracts to provide new superfast mobile networks called 5G. The U.S. says Meng helped break sanctions and accuses Huawei of stealing trade secrets. It also says the company could let the Chinese government tap its networks, which in the case of 5G would cover massive amounts of consumer data worldwide. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pressed that point to European allies on a tour this week.\n\nHuawei, which did not respond to requests for comment for this story, has previously rejected the allegations. The Chinese government says Huawei's critics were fabricating threats.\n\nStill, the headlines have been relentlessly negative.\n\n\"At some point there could be a majority of Canadians that will say 'We don't think the government should do business with Huawei,'\" said Saint-Jacques.\n\nThere's no evidence of sinister intentions behind Huawei's marketing, which isn't unlike that of Western multinationals, although its efforts have been unusually strong for a company from China, where brands have struggled to capture global attention.\n\nRogers Communications, which broadcasts \"Hockey in Night in Canada\" and also sells Huawei smartphones, said it has no plans to change its sponsorship deal, which started in 2017 and runs to the end of 2020.\n\nIn Australia, the Canberra Raiders rugby team indicated it would renew a Huawei sponsorship deal this year despite a government ban on using its equipment in 5G networks.\n\nHuawei has also ventured into high culture by using its smartphone artificial intelligence to complete the remaining movements in German composer Franz Schubert's \"Symphony No. 8,\" known as the \"Unfinished Symphony.\" It held a symphony orchestra concert in London this month to perform the completed score.\n\nAnd Huawei has a vast network of relationships with universities around the world through research partnerships and scholarships. It has helped fund a 25 million pound ($32 million) joint research project at Britain's Cambridge University.\n\nSome universities have begun to rethink their collaborations, although there's no allegation of wrongdoing by Huawei. Universities point out that companies that fund research don't automatically own any resulting patents.\n\nBritain's Oxford University stopped accepting Huawei's money last month. Stanford University followed suit after U.S. prosecutors unsealed nearly two dozen charges against the company, as did the University of California at Berkeley, which also removed an off-campus videoconferencing set-up donated by Huawei based on guidance from the Department of Defence .\n\nFaced with these setbacks, Huawei has responded by stepping up its public relations efforts.\n\nStory continues"

Readers are also discussing Venezuela, where there are currently two presidents vying for the support for the country\u2019s military, and John McCallum, Canada\u2019s ambassador to China, who has apologized for wading into the legal battle of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou.\n\nOpen this photo in gallery Prime Minister Justin Trudeau holds a town hall meeting at James M. Hill High School in Miramichi, N.B., on Thursday, Jan. 24, 2019. Andrew Vaughan/The Canadian Press\n\nTrudeau warns voters to be wary of fear-mongering about immigration\n\nI am more worried about the fear mongering coming out of the Liberal party than any other Canadian source. - BC Thoughts\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nI do not think the vast majority of Canadians are opposed to immigration. What they do not like is the uncontrolled entry into our country by so many. My parents are immigrants and I was seven months old when they arrived here. They came through the proper channels and had to support themselves. There was no free accommodation, free medical care, dental or money supplied for children. My parents supported their children and all are now successful. They taught us that hard work was required to be successful but also that we had to work for what what we got. Now people walk across the border and are provided with everything my parents were required to do on their own. I want to see people enter this country through the proper channels. Is that too much to ask? - whodat singer\n\nIn response to whodat singer:\n\nI came to Canada with parents also. As with your parents there was the expectation that they would be self-sufficient from the minute they set foot in Canada. The same standards still apply to all who enter Canada through legitimate channels, whether they be landed immigrants or individuals on student, worker or visitor visas. - OffTheClock\n\nJustin Trudeau, the man who has pitted east against west, rich against poor, and divided the nation on gender, race and income. He is the ultimate fear monger. - Jack Bauer\n\nAnother case of one yardstick for the distinct society which is Quebec and another standard for the Rest of Canada. Francois Legault demands that Quebec take in 20 per cent fewer immigrants and apply a Quebec values test to the applicants, but Trudeau does not brand the Quebec premier as a fear monger.\n\nImagine Justin Trudeau's response to Doug Ford demanding a reduction of 20 per cent in the number of immigrants coming to Ontario, implementing an Ontario values test including the evaluation of each immigrant's proficiency in English. In this election year Trudeau will play up the emotional issue of immigration everywhere but La Belle Provence. - Snowaway\n\nWhat else readers are discussing today:\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nVenezuelans, with two presidents, on edge waiting for a decisive move from the military\n\nOpen this photo in gallery Flanked by the country\u2019s top military leaders, Venezuelan Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez declares his support for beleaguered United Socialist Party Leader Nicolas Maduro at a news conference in Caracas on Thursday.

Maduro has to go. - CitizenWhoPaysTaxesNotTaxPayer\n\nThe reality is that Venezuela was once a thriving country and now it has been reduced to the circumstances of Haiti, dependent on black markets to obtain basic needs. People are leaving the country in desperation to survive. Gang rule has become predominant and violent crime routine. Government infrastructure has broken down. The nation has been reduced to strong man rule bidding for the support of the military that itself is looking to maintain and strengthen its position. Banana republicanism rules. No hope.

Maybe so, but winning the release these Canadian cannot be the sole concern of this government. Maintaining credibility in the international community and upholding our legal commitments under our treaties are equally important objectives, and it is on that basis that McCallum should be fired. - Delphicorical\n\nMcCallum should do the right thing and resign immediately. - MACKINNONJWM\n\nOur ambassador to China should not have apologized for stating what should be obvious to any sane person. - Robert Sinclair 3\n\nIn response to Robert Sinclair 3:\n\nAgree. As the article states at one point, McCallum was trying to demonstrate to Beijing\u2019s rulers that Canada\u2019s justice system is fair and impartial and Ms. Meng would have the opportunity to vigorously defend herself. He should not have apologized however. - George Bay\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nDidn\u2019t the Liberal candidate in Burnaby South get fired for misspeaking too? Be interesting to see how PM Trudeau slips and slides through this mess McCallum has made. Either you treat everyone the same or you get replaced. - Jack Reacher\n\nTrudeau is saying the case will have no political interference. What a joke. When the Canadian ambassador gives a news conference in Markham for the Chinese press and discusses that fact that Meng has a strong case to avoid extradition, it\u2019s very political.

    "text": "Photo: The Canadian Press The Trans Mountain pipeline crossing in Stewart Creek in Chilliwack, B.C., on Dec. 12, 2018 in this handout photo.\n\nWork on a Trans Mountain pipeline crossing in a British Columbia stream has destroyed salmon habitat, raising concerns about the Crown corporation's ability to build infrastructure through waterways if the expansion project proceeds, a scientist says.\n\nMike Pearson says the \"amateur hour\" work on the Stewart Creek crossing in Chilliwack will reduce food sources for coho and chum salmon and limit their ability to hide from predators. The fish are part of the diet of endangered southern resident killer whales.\n\n\"There was no consideration given whatsoever to the habitat, which is just not acceptable,\" said Pearson, a biologist with 30 years' experience, in an interview.\n\nTrans Mountain Corp. filed documents with the National Energy Board showing its plans to cover exposed pipe in the Fraser Valley creek. It wrote that it would place concrete mats in the channel, extending about eight metres upstream and nine metres downstream of the exposed line, and cover it with small stones.\n\nPearson said the work was completed in August to September of last year. He visited the site in December and took photos that he says show most of the stones have been swept away by currents, leaving the concrete blocks exposed.\n\n\"The work has degraded habitat in several ways,\" he wrote in an assessment filed with the energy board by intervener Yarrow Ecovillage.\n\nThe smooth, hard concrete provides no hiding places for salmon, supports very few of the aquatic invertebrates they feed on, inhibits plant growth and prevents fish from burying their eggs, the document says.\n\nPearson believes it's not an isolated incident. An assessment he did of a pipeline creek crossing on Sumas Mountain in 2015 for Pipe Up Network, an anti-pipeline group, concluded the site was physically unstable and reconstructed with materials inappropriate to restoring habitat.\n\nA stream-keeper has also raised concerns about excavation at Trans Mountain's terminal in Burnaby. John Preissl has filed several complaints with the energy board alleging the work has caused sediment to fall into two salmon-bearing creeks.\n\nFederal and provincial officials inspected the terminal in April and found improperly installed sediment and erosion control measures. A follow-up energy board report concluded Trans Mountain had fixed the problems by the end of November.\n\nTrans Mountain said in a statement that the BC Oil and Gas Commission approved its Stewart Creek work and found no issues in site inspections during and after construction.\n\nIt said a third-party engineer designed the plan to protect the exposed line and conducted a study to ensure it would not impede fish passage. Environmental plans were created and work was monitored full-time by a qualified environmental professional, it said.\n\nAs for Pearson's 2015 criticism of the Sumas Mountain crossing, Trans Mountain said an independent environmental consultant completed an assessment and made a management plan. The work was monitored by an environmental professional and the oil and gas commission found no issues.\n\nIt also said \"extensive\" sediment control measures and mitigation efforts are in place at its Burnaby terminal.\n\nThe corporation added that field crews investigated all potential watercourse crossings for its expansion project even before it applied to the energy board for approval.\n\n\"The information gleaned from this fieldwork allows us to avoid or minimize impact to fish and fish habitat during pipeline construction,\" it said, adding environmental inspectors will monitor construction.\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau's government has purchased the pipeline and expansion project for $4.5 billion."

    "title": "Former China envoys call on Xi Jinping to release two detained Canadians",
    "text": "Open letter says the arrests mean diplomats are more cautious about work in China\n\nMore than 140 former diplomats and leading China experts have called on Xi Jinping to release two Canadian citizens detained last month as a diplomatic stand-off between Ottawa and Beijing escalates.\n\nIn an open letter to the Chinese president, former envoys to China from Canada, the UK, the US, Australia, Germany, Sweden and Mexico described how the arrests of Michael Kovrig, a Canadian diplomat on leave, and Michael Spavor, a businessman, have sent a chill through the diplomatic community.\n\n\u201cWe who share Kovrig and Spavor\u2019s enthusiasm for building genuine, productive, and lasting relationships must now be more cautious about travelling and working in China and engaging our Chinese counterparts,\u201d the statement said.\n\n\u201cThat will lead to less dialogue and greater distrust, and undermine efforts to manage disagreements and identify common ground. Both China and the rest of the world will be worse off as a result.\u201d\n\nKovrig and Spavor were detained on 10 December, in a move widely seen as retaliation following the arrest by Canadian authorities on 1 December of a senior Huawei executive, Meng Wanzhou, for extradition to the US where she faces accusations of fraud and violations of sanctions on Iran.\n\nChina expresses 'strong dissatisfaction' with Trudeau as countries spar Read more\n\nThe detention of the two Canadians on unspecified allegations of endangering national security has caused heightened concerns for foreigners about their safety. Like Kovrig, many ex-diplomats go into academia, consulting or business related to the country of their former posting.\n\n\u201cIt has people looking over their shoulders, because in China there is always a real ambiguity in terms of what the government will and will not tolerate,\u201d said David Mulroney, Canada\u2019s ambassador to China from 2009 to 2012.\n\nJorge Guajardo, Mexico\u2019s ambassador to China from 2007 to 2013, said he consistently received questions about the safety of visiting China. \u201cThere have been ongoing queries. \u2018Should I go, should I not go?\u2019 People living there are saying: \u2018Should I leave now?\u2019 It\u2019s an issue of concern,\u201d he said.\n\nSome worry a new normal is emerging in which China will behave more aggressively toward current and former diplomats. Those who try to meet prisoners of conscience, travel to sensitive areas such as Xinjiang or Tibet or attend the trials of dissidents often encounter obstacles set up by Chinese authorities.\n\nTheir diplomatic immunity means they have been able to push back against government restrictions but they may begin censuring themselves if they fear their work could jeopardise them.\n\n\u201cIn the past, diplomats could push that envelope more than most,\u201d said Mulroney. \u201cWhat might happen is diplomats themselves might think twice. Countries may say: \u2018Let\u2019s not rock the boat because we don\u2019t want an incident involving you.\u2019 What that does is it really cuts off an important source of information,\u201d he said.\n\nCanada\u2019s prime minister, Justin Trudeau, has said China is \u201cnot respecting the principles of diplomatic immunity\u201d in connection with Kovrig. Under the Vienna convention, immunity extends to the work done while serving on a mission even afterdiplomatic status has ended.\n\nCanada claims that Kovrig\u2019s interrogations have focused on his work as a diplomat, but China\u2019s foreign ministry denies Kovrig should be granted immunity.\n\nCanada\u2019s ambassador to China, John McCallum, told parliament\u2019s foreign affairs committee on Friday that Spavor and Kovrig continued to endure abuse at the hands of Chinese officials, according to the Globe and Mail.\n\nThey are subjected to daily interrogations that last up to four hours and face sleep deprivation techniques, including having lights left on 24 hours a day. They are only allowed one consular visit per month and are forbidden from speaking French to prevent the passing of secret messages, according to the Globe.\n\nLast week, Robert Schellenberg, another Canadian, was sentenced to death for drug smuggling after a sudden retrial.\n\nA Canadian woman, Ti-Anna Wang, the daughter of a Chinese democracy activist who has been imprisoned for life, was barred from entering China last week when she attempted to visit her father. She was later detained at Beijing airport when she tried to transit through China to return home and was forced to leave the country.\n\n\u201cMy guess is this is the new status quo. China is crossing a line deliberately and they are now on the other side of the line,\u201d said Guajardo.\n\nIn the latest contribution to the debate in Canada, a former spy chief said the country should ban Huawei from supplying equipment to Canadian 5G networks because the security risk is too great.\n\nRichard Fadden, who served as the head of the security intelligence service spy from 2009 to 2013, cited what he said was mounting evidence for blocking Huawei. \u201cCanada\u2019s government should ignore the threats and ban Huawei from Canada\u2019s 5G networks to protect the security of Canadians,\u201d he wrote in the Globe and Mail."

    "title": "Tuesday briefing: Brexit \u2013 make do and amend",
    "text": "Top story: \u2018Brady amendment\u2019 or \u2018Malthouse compromise\u2019?\n\nGood morning, I\u2019m Warren Murray and here is today\u2019s order of business.\n\nA flurry of amendments to Theresa May\u2019s Brexit bill will come before the House of Commons today. The PM has urged Conservative MPs to support replacing the Irish border backstop with \u201calternative arrangements\u201d via an amendment tabled by Tory chair Graham Brady. The aim is to get opponents to pass May\u2019s amended bill, in the hope the European Union will reciprocate with concessions on the backstop. Brussels has continued to insist negotiations cannot be reopened.\n\nOvernight a surprise initiative dubbed the \u201cMalthouse compromise\u201d emerged. It involves drafting a new backstop that would be acceptable indefinitely, while incentivising the EU and UK to move beyond it and reach a new future relationship. In a message to Tory MPs, the remainer Nicky Morgan said: \u201cIt ensures there is no need for a hard border with Ireland.\u201d The hardline Tory Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg was said to have backed the idea.\n\nHere is a list of Tuesday\u2019s proposed amendments \u2013 notable among them, options to extend article 50, establish a citizens\u2019 assembly, or hold a second referendum. There are divisions within Labour over whether Yvette Cooper\u2019s amendment to rule out a no-deal Brexit should be supported, or whether the party\u2019s pro-Brexit constituents would see it as a rebuff to their wishes. Labour has also performed a late U-turn over the immigration bill \u2013 after instructing its MPs to abstain, the party came in for intense criticism and eventually allowed MPs the option of voting against it.\n\nIn London\u2019s \u201cSilicon Roundabout\u201d tech district, John Harris finds that the implications of Brexit are emptying the ranks of talented and much-needed European staff. And Polly Toynbee writes that P&O dropping the British flag because of Brexit shows the decline of a rich seafaring tradition.\n\nHuawei\u2019s woes worsen \u2013 A Chinese telecommunications company has been charged overnight by the US with stealing trade secrets, laundering money, obstructing justice and evading sanctions on Iran. The FBI says Huawei offered bonuses for employees to steal information from other companies. Among such instances, investigators say, engineers from Huawei copied and stole parts from a robot called \u201cTappy\u201d used by T-Mobile to make smartphones. The company has denied the charges, which Beijing has called \u201cimmoral\u201d. Meng Wanzhou, the Huawei finance chief, remains under Canadian house arrest on a US extradition warrant.\n\nScreen dims young minds \u2013 Frequent use of screens by children aged two to five has been linked to developmental delays by researchers in Canada. The more time children were reported to be spending in front of screens, the worse they did on development tests. The researchers say parents should be cautious about time spent with devices \u2013 on average, the 2,400 children they studied spent about 17 hours a week in front of screens at two years old, increasing to almost 25 hours a week at three years, before falling to 11 hours a week at five. Meanwhile the electronic bullying of young people has grown significantly worse in recent years, according to the UK\u2019s media watchdog. Ofcom says 9% of 12- to 15-year-olds report being bullied via text messages and apps.\n\nPressure piled on Maduro \u2013 The US government has announced sanctions against Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil company, PDVSA, as the Trump administration tries to force out President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. After the opposition leader, Juan Guaid\u00f3, declared himself Venezuela\u2019s rightful interim president, New Zealand has refused to join close allies like the US, Australia, the UK and Canada in giving him its backing. \u201cIt is not New Zealand\u2019s practice to make statements of recognition of governments,\u201d said Winston Peters, the NZ foreign affairs minister.\n\nRat plague haunts man \u2013 A former inmate of Wormwood Scrubs is bringing a claim for post-traumatic stress disorder, saying he was left mentally scarred by rats swarming around the jail, running over him in bed and eating his cellmate\u2019s smoky bacon crisps. In 2015, officers from HM Inspectorate of Prisons officers found rats \u201cevery day and night we visited the prison and a large rats\u2019 nest was very obvious in the grounds\u201d. The ex-prisoner, 71, says being almost always locked in his cell had meant there was no escape from the scurrying tormentors. His lawyer, Jane Ryan at Bhatt Murphy Solicitors, is suing the Ministry of Justice on his behalf. \u201cLiving conditions in prisons should be humane for the benefit of staff and prisoners,\u201d said Ryan.\n\nNo end to waste \u2013 About 1.2bn ends of bread loaves that could be eaten are being binned, according to a campaign to plough them back into meals. The North London Waste Authority has got together with chefs to come up with ways to save a crust, like the panzanella salad recipe that you can find at the bottom of our story. Better get stockpiling for 29 March \u2026\n\nToday in Focus podcast: Bercow\u2019s Brexit\n\nToday is the day that backbench MPs in parliament could wrestle control of the Brexit process away from the government. Overseeing proceedings is the all-powerful Speaker, John Bercow.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest John Bercow, the Speaker of the House of Commons. Photograph: Reuters Tv/Reuters\n\nBut is he pushing an agenda from the traditionally neutral chair? Plus, in opinion: Jonathan Freedland on the Brexit-backing elite and how they will avoid the worst consequences of leaving the EU.\n\nLunchtime read: Milk of human consumerism\n\nWhen it comes to milk, in 2019 there is no shortage of alternatives, and alternatives to those alternatives. Supermarket aisles overflow with choice: almond, hazelnut, peanut, tiger nut, walnut, cashew, coconut, hemp, spelt, quinoa, pea. Ads abound for new plant \u201cmylks\u201d \u2013 EU law dictates anything promoted as \u201cmilk\u201d must come from a lactating mammal. In New York, when coffee shops ran out of oat milk, there was mild panic.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Illustration: Lee Martin/Guardian Design\n\nFrom the days when soy milk sat lonely on the shelves, the global plant milk industry is now estimated to be worth $16bn. Real milk\u2019s reputation as a healthy food is under threat from anxieties ranging from lactose intolerance and bovine antibiotics to animal cruelty and the dairy industry\u2019s environmental impact. But whether or not plant milks really are a healthy substitute for cow\u2019s milk is a matter of fierce and not inconsequential debate.\n\nSport\n\nEddie Jones\u2019s England are set for a severe mental and physical examination against Ireland when they open their Six Nations campaign at the weekend in a stadium where they have enjoyed little success. Manchester United have been handed the chance to exact FA Cup revenge when they travel to face the holders Chelsea next month. Barnet, the last non-league side in this season\u2019s competition, are still in with a chance of reaching the last 16 after a 3-3 draw forced a replay with Brentford.\n\nJasmin Paris, the ultrarunner who became a global sensation earlier this month when she won the 268-mile Spine Race, beating her male rivals by 15 hours and the course record by over 12, has been selected to run for Britain. And Ben Foakes has said the margin of England\u2019s defeat against West Indies in Barbados suggests something is not right.\n\nBusiness\n\nThe news of charges against Huawei sparked a slide on Asian markets. The Nikkei, Kospi, Hang Seng and Shanghai Composite all fell. Australia\u2019s S&P/ASX 200, reopening after a holiday, eased 0.6%. Stocks fell in Taiwan and Singapore but rose in Indonesia. The FTSE is forecast to open higher, and sterling has been trading at $1.315 and \u20ac1.150 overnight.\n\nThe papers\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that Brexit is splashed across just about all of the front pages. The Guardian leads with \u201cMay supports Irish backstop changes amid Tory splits\u201d. The FT has: \u201cMay seeks to split Tory hardliners with bid to amend Brexit backstop\u201d. The Times says: \u201cTory rebels reject May\u2019s Plan B\u201d. The Express strikes a positive tone, carrying a picture of Boris Johnson and Theresa May with the headline: \u201cWe can do it together\u201d. The i takes the opposite view on the former foreign secretary and one of his fellow rebel Tories: \u201cJohnson and Rees-Mogg cut PM\u2019s lifeline\u201d. The Daily Mirror leads on warnings about Brexit food shortages: \u201cNo Deal, No Meal\u201d is its headline.\n\nGuardian front page, 29 January 2019.\n\nThe Sun seems to ignore the Tory crisis, instead attacking Jeremy Corbyn: \u201cDon\u2019t let Labour kill Brexit\u201d. The Telegraph devotes its splash not to Brexit but to Philip Green: \u201cGreen urged to let his accusers tell their story\u201d is its main headline, with a smaller story noting Tory Eurosceptics are in revolt \u201cover Brexit plan B\u201d. And the Mail ignores Brexit altogether on its front page, instead leading with the headline \u201cGeneration of web addicts\u201d, about children\u2019s obsession with the internet.\n\nSign up\n\nThe Guardian Morning Briefing is delivered to thousands of inboxes bright and early every weekday.

    "text": "(BEIJING) \u2014 China called on the U.S. government on Tuesday to \u201cstop the unreasonable crackdown\u201d on Huawei after the United States stepped up pressure on the tech giant by indicting it on charges of stealing technology and violating sanctions on Iran.\n\nThe Chinese government will \u201cfirmly defend\u201d its companies, a foreign ministry statement said. It gave no indication whether Beijing might retaliate for the charges against Huawei, China\u2019s first global tech brand and the biggest maker of switching gear for phone and internet companies.\n\nU.S. pressure on China is set to intensify further when intelligence chiefs brief Congress Tuesday on worldwide threats, which are expected to include Chinese cyber espionage and Huawei.\n\nHuawei Technologies Ltd., which has spent a decade battling U.S. accusations it is a front for Chinese spying, denied committing any of the violations cited in Monday\u2019s indictment.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now\n\nThe foreign ministry complained Washington has \u201cmobilized state power\u201d to hurt Chinese companies \u201cin an attempt to strangle fair and just operations.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe strongly urge the United States to stop the unreasonable crackdown on Chinese companies including Huawei,\u201d said the statement read on state TV. It said Beijing will defend the \u201clawful rights and interests of Chinese companies\u201d but gave no details.\n\nThe charges unsealed Monday by the Justice Department accused Huawei of trying to take a piece of a robot and other technology from a T-Mobile lab that was used to test smartphones. Huawei passed Apple in mid-2018 as the second-biggest global smartphone brand after Samsung.\n\nThe U.S. charges included no allegation Huawei worked at the Chinese government\u2019s direction. But the U.S. government has previously accused China of involvement in cyberspying and theft of industrial secrets. It has charged several Chinese hackers and intelligence officials.\n\nHuawei also is charged with using a Hong Kong front company, Skycom, to trade with Iran in violation of U.S. controls. Prosecuters allege Huawei\u2019s chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, lied to banks about those dealings.\n\nMeng, the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, was arrested Dec. 1 in Vancouver, a development that set off a political firestorm between China and Canada.\n\nChina detained two Canadians shortly after Meng\u2019s arrest in an apparent attempt to pressure Canada to release her. A Chinese court also sentenced a third Canadian to death in a sudden retrial of a drug case, overturning a 15-year prison term handed down earlier.\n\n\u201cWe urge the U.S. to immediately withdraw the arrest warrant against Miss Meng Wanzhou and stop making such kinds of extradition requests,\u201d said a Foreign Ministry spokesman, Geng Shuang. \u201cWe urge Canada to take seriously China\u2019s solemn position, immediately release Ms. Meng Wanzhou and protect her legitimate and legal rights.\u201d\n\nHuawei, headquartered in the southern city of Shenzhen, near Hong Kong, has rejected the U.S. accusations.\n\n\u201cThe company denies that it or its subsidiary or affiliate have committed any of the asserted violations of U.S. law set forth in each of the indictments,\u201d a Huawei statement said.\n\nHuawei is \u201cnot aware of any wrongdoing by Ms. Meng, and believes the U.S. courts will ultimately reach the same conclusion,\u201d it said.\n\nMeng is out on bail in Vancouver and is due in court Tuesday as she awaits extradition proceedings.\n\nHuawei\u2019s U.S. market evaporated after a 2012 congressional report said it and Chinese rival ZTE Corp. were security risks and told phone companies to avoid them. But Huawei says the scrutiny has had little impact on its business elsewhere.\n\nThe company says it serves 45 of the 50 biggest global telecom carriers. It forecasts its 2018 global revenue should exceed $100 billion for the first time despite the tension with Washington.\n\nHuawei said U.S. prosecutors rejected a request to discuss the investigation following Meng\u2019s arrest. It also noted the allegations in the trade secrets charge were the subject of a U.S. civil lawsuit that already has been settled.\n\nThe latest charges could dim prospects for U.S.-Chinese trade talks due to start Wednesday in Washington.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, agreed Dec. 1 to put off any further sanctions against each other\u2019s exports while they negotiated. A breakdown would likely lead to higher tariffs, a prospect that has rattled financial markets for months.\n\nThe entirely state-controlled Chinese press has portrayed Huawei as the victim of U.S. government efforts to cripple a potential industrial challenger.\n\n\u201cThis is not just the matter of Huawei. It involves the whole nation of China,\u201d said Qin Xiaohua, who works in the finance industry in Beijing. \u201cWe have to unite no matter as individuals or as an integrated country.\u201d\n\nWhile U.S. authorities stress the independence of courts, \u201cordinary Chinese people all believe it is a deliberate crackdown on Huawei,\u201d said Lu Feng, an economist at Peking University. He said Beijing will see a \u201clink to Chinese-U.S. trade relations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe difference in understanding will bring about complicated problems,\u201d said Lu.\n\nAsked about the possible effect of the Huawei case on trade talks, the foreign ministry spokesman, Geng, said, \u201cas for the China-U.S. trade talks and our position on this, I think the U.S. is also quite clear about that.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department officials provided details from a 10-count grand jury indictment in Seattle, and a separate 13-count case from prosecutors in New York.\n\nThe Seattle charges allege that beginning in 2012, Huawei plotted to steal information about T-Mobile\u2019s robot, known as \u201cTappy.\u201d It says Huawei engineers secretly took photos of the robot, measured it and tried to steal part of it from T-Mobile\u2019s lab, according to prosecutors. T-Mobile declined to comment.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com."

    "text": "What do the U.S.-China trade war, Huawei\u2019s Meng Wanzhou and the world\u2019s first alleged gene-edited baby have in common? They\u2019re all controversial subjects in China, and were among the most censored topics last year on the country\u2019s ubiquitous social media app, WeChat, according to new research.\n\nLast year, WeChatscope, a research project at the University of Hong Kong, tracked more than 4,000 public accounts covering daily news on WeChat. Of the 1.04 million articles reviewed, 11,000 were removed, the researchers revealed earlier this week.\n\nAssociate professor King-wa Fu, who leads the project at the university\u2019s Journalism and Media Studies Center, said Sino-U.S. relations were among the most censored topics last year.\n\n\u201cThere were disputes regarding ZTE and Huawei, multiple rounds of trade negotiations, and finally, the arrest of Huawei CTO, Meng Wanzhou, at the end of 2018,\u201d he told TIME.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now\n\nThe researchers\u2019 list of the ten most controversial topics also revealed that the #MeToo hashtag was heavily censored, as was coverage of the allegation that Peking University tried to silence activists protesting a two-decades-old rape allegation involving a former professor. A vaccine scandal in July that saw one of the country\u2019s largest vaccine makers distribute substandard vaccines to thousands of babies also made the list.\n\nThe WeChatscope team arrived at these findings by building a technical web \u201cscraping\u201d system. By tracking the thousands of public accounts posting daily news, the system was able to detect when a post disappeared.\n\nThe researchers said the most common official reason provided for disappeared articles was that the content was \u201cdeleted by the publisher.\u201d\n\n\u201cSelf-censorship is a common practice among internet users in China as online speech can easily bring them trouble,\u201d the report said.\n\n\u201cUsers will often remove their own posts if they receive warning from senior colleagues or employers,\u201d it added.\n\nThe three other prevailing reasons were that the content was found by censorship authorities to violate regulations, the user was blocked or the content was reported.\n\nFu predicts that the U.S.-China trade dispute will continue to be the main topic censored on WeChat in 2019.\n\n\u201cThere will be a lot more developments, most immediately with the tariff deadline coming up,\u201d Fu says, referring to a tariff hike that may impact another $200 billion of Chinese imports on March 2.\n\nIn 2018, China was the worst abuser of internet freedom for the fourth consecutive year, according to a study conducted by Freedom on the Net. In addition to operating its own sophisticated internet censorship apparatus known as the \u201cGreat Firewall\u201d, China is also training other countries on its model, exporting hardware and advanced data tools to allow repressive regimes to control their netizens.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com."

    "text": "More than 100 China experts and former envoys to Beijing called on President Xi Jinping to release two Canadians who have been detained for six weeks, saying the cases undermine his efforts to build bridges to the rest of the world.\n\nThe group, including former U.S. Ambassador Gary Locke, ex-Hong Kong Governor Christopher Patten and five former Canadian ambassadors to China, released an open letter to the Chinese leader Tuesday urging the two men\u2019s freedom. The letter said that Michael Kovrig, a Canadian diplomat on leave to work with the International Crisis Group in Hong Kong, and Michael Spavor, an entrepreneur who helped organize tourist trips to North Korea, had advocated exchanges that help build ties around the globe.\n\n\u201cWe who share Kovrig and Spavor\u2019s enthusiasm for building genuine, productive and lasting relationships must now be more cautious about traveling and working in China and engaging our Chinese counterparts,\u201d the letter said. \u201cThat will lead to less dialogue and greater distrust, and undermine efforts to manage disagreements and identify common ground.\u201d\n\nThe letter represented the latest effort to increase international pressure over the detentions, which came days after Canada arrested Huawei Technologies Co.

He was then selected to be a representative of the 12th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 1982.\n\n\"As Meng Wanzhou's father, I miss her very much,\" Ren said. \"Throughout her childhood, I was in the military, which means that each year I was away for 11 months, spending one month with my family.\"\n\n- Connections? -\n\nRen's prestigious political chops has engendered questions about his connection to the Chinese state.\n\n\"The National Congress is the once-in-a-decade forum through which the next leaders of the Chinese state are chosen,\" a US Congress panel wrote in 2012 investigative report on Huawei.\n\n\"Mr. Ren proudly admits that he was invited to that Congress, but he will not describe his duties.\"\n\nRen has denied any close connection to Beijing, saying he was just a veteran without a military rank.\n\nHuawei has long rejected such Western accusations, saying there was \"no evidence\" it poses a threat to the national security of any country."

Prosecuters allege the company\u2019s chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, lied to banks about those dealings.\n\nMeng, the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, was arrested Dec. 1 in Vancouver on U.S. charges related to Iran, a development that set off a political firestorm between China and Canada.\n\n\u201cThe company denies that it or its subsidiary or affiliate have committed any of the asserted violations of U.S. law set forth in each of the indictments,\u201d a Huawei statement said.\n\nHuawei is \u201cnot aware of any wrongdoing by Ms. Meng, and believes the U.S. courts will ultimately reach the same conclusion,\u201d it said.\n\nThere was no allegation Huawei was working at the Chinese government\u2019s direction. The U.S. government previously has accused Beijing of involvement in cyberspying and theft of industrial secrets. It has charged several Chinese hackers and intelligence officials.\n\nHuawei said U.S. prosecutors rejected a request to discuss the investigation following Meng\u2019s arrest. It also noted the allegations in the trade secrets charge were the subject of a U.S. civil lawsuit that already has been settled.\n\nMeng is out on bail in Vancouver and is due in court Tuesday as she awaits extradition proceedings. Her case has set off diplomatic spats between the United States, China and Canada.\n\nThe latest charges could dim prospects for U.S.-Chinese trade talks due to start Wednesday in Washington.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, agreed Dec. 1 to put off any further sanctions against each other\u2019s exports while they negotiated. A breakdown in negotiations would likely lead to higher tariffs, a prospect that has rattled financial markets for months.\n\nWhile U.S. authorities stress that courts are independent, \u201cordinary Chinese people all believe it is a deliberate crackdown on Huawei,\u201d said Lu Feng, an economist at Peking University.\n\n\u201cFrom the U.S. perspective, it is a law enforcement issue, but from China\u2019s viewpoint, it has a link to Chinese-U.S. trade relations,\u201d said Lu. \u201cThe difference in understanding will bring about complicated problems.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department officials provided details from a 10-count grand jury indictment in Seattle, and a separate 13-count case from prosecutors in New York.\n\nThe Seattle charges allege that beginning in 2012, Huawei plotted to steal information about T-Mobile\u2019s robot, known as \u201cTappy.\u201d It says Huawei engineers secretly took photos of the robot, measured it and tried to steal part of it from T-Mobile\u2019s lab, according to prosecutors.

China\u2019s vague national security laws are commonly used to target critics of the ruling Communist Party.\n\nYang, 53, was due to arrive in the Chinese city of Guangzhou early on Dec. 19 and then travel on to Shanghai with his family. But he never cleared security for the second leg of the journey, said Feng Chongyi, an associate professor in China studies at the University of Technology Sydney. Yang reportedly told Feng that his trip to China would not attract any attention from authorities, the Sydney Morning Herald reports.\n\nA Wednesday statement from Australia\u2019s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said the government was \u201cseeking to clarify the nature of this detention and to obtain consular access to him.\u201d Australian officials were due to meet with Chinese authorities in Beijing Thursday to learn more about the situation.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

Following the December arrest in Canada of Meng Wanzhou, a high-ranking executive of Chinese technology firm Huawei, Beijing arrested two Canadians \u2014 Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig. The government of Canada later said more than a dozen of its citizens had been detained, most of them released.\n\nNeither is this Yang\u2019s first run-in with Chinese authorities.

Time\n\nBEIJING \u2013 China on Tuesday demanded the U.S. drop a request that Canada extradite a top executive of the tech giant Huawei, shifting blame to Washington in a case that has severely damaged Beijing\u2019s relations with Ottawa.\n\nForeign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Meng Wanzhou\u2019s case was out of the ordinary and Canada\u2019s extradition treaty with the U.S. infringed on the \u201csafety and legitimate rights and interests of Chinese citizens.\u201d\n\nHua said China demands that the U.S. withdraw the arrest warrant against Meng and \u201cnot make a formal extradition request to the Canadian side.\u201d\n\nHua\u2019s remarks come after more than 100 academics and former diplomats signed a letter calling on China to release two Canadians detained in apparent retaliation for Meng\u2019s arrest.\n\nThey also follow a report by the Canadian newspaper Globe and Mail that the U.S. plans to formally request Meng\u2019s extradition to face charges that she committed fraud by misleading banks about Huawei\u2019s business dealings in Iran.\n\nMore: Chinese citizens celebrate after Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou is released in Canada\n\nMore: Canadian man sentenced to death over drug smuggling charges in China\n\nChina detained former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and Canadian entrepreneur Michael Spavor on Dec. 10 in an apparent attempt to pressure Canada to release Meng, who was arrested Dec. 1 at the request of U.S. authorities.\n\nMeng is Huawei\u2019s chief financial officer and the daughter of its founder, Ren Zhengfei. Huawei has close ties to China\u2019s military and is considered one of the country\u2019s most successful international enterprises, operating in the high-tech sphere where China hopes to establish dominance.\n\nIn this Dec. 12, 2018, file photo, Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou arrives at a parole office with a security guard in Vancouver, British Columbia.

(Photo11: Darryl Dyck, AP)\n\nThe letter signed by academics and former diplomats said the arrests of the two will lead to \u201cless dialogue and greater distrust, and undermine efforts to manage disagreements and identify common ground. Both China and the rest of the world will be worse off as a result.\u201d\n\nMore than 20 diplomats from seven countries and more than 100 scholars and academics from 19 countries signed.\n\nMeng is living under house arrest in her Vancouver mansion while her case is under deliberation. Kovrig and Spavor are being held in Chinese jails and have yet to be granted access to lawyers, according to those who have contact with them.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/01/22/huawei-china-demands-us-drop-extradition-request-meng-wanzhou/2642364002/"

Charges came against telecom giant Huawei and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, who's been held in Canada since last month.

    "text": "Share\n\nOn Tuesday\u2019s episode of Digital Trends Live, we discussed trending headlines from an Apple bug that allows callers to listen in on your device without your permission, the U.S. government filing criminal charges against telecommunications company Huawei, and Instagram going down. Ronan Glon also dropped by to talk about the latest news coming out of the industry and we sat down with the CEO of The Glimpse Group Lyron Bentovim to discuss how businesses are using AR and VR.\n\nA newly found FaceTime bug lets users hear audio from the person they\u2019re calling even before they\u2019ve answered. The issue is part of the Group Call feature in the FaceTime app, which Apple launched back in 2018. Besides the obvious privacy concerns this bug presents for the tech giant, Apple may have been aware of the glitch up to a week ago, but didn\u2019t make a public announcement until January 28. For the time being, Group Call is disabled while Apple looks for a solution to this troubling flaw in their service.\n\nThe U.S. government also announced this week criminal charges against Chinese telecommunications company Huawei. The charges, against both the company itself, and Huawei\u2019s chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, include bank and wire fraud, obstruction of justice, and theft of technology from T-Mobile dating back to 2012. It\u2019s unclear what\u2019s going to happen next in terms of the lawsuits, but possible American legislation against the tech company could be problematic for the state of technology in the U.S., particularly when it comes to 5G, of which Huawei is a leader.\n\nLater in the show, we were joined by Lyron Bentovim, founder and CEO of the The Glimpse Group, to talk about the business side of technologies like augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). Rather than working directly with the consumers who use the technology, The Glimpse Group is focused on empowering entrepreneurs in the industry and simplifying challenges that businesses may face when trying to incorporate the technology into their plans.\n\nDigital Trends Live airs at 9 a.m. PT from Monday through Friday, with highlights available on demand after the stream ends.

I remember the distinct feeling of being through the looking glass when I read it. It also introduced we West Coasters to the phenomenon of waking up, checking your phone, and getting the distinct impression that the world is on fire.\n\nSeveral readers commented on Trump\u2019s impact on international relations:\n\n\u201cSomewhere in the next 50 fumbles,\u201d said Lenny Smith of Clarksboro, New Jersey, \u201cwe should include the rude pushing-aside of the prime minister of Montenegro so Trump could be in the spotlight.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo me, the biggest damage may be the abandoned treaties and NATO support,\u201d argued Paul David Musgrave of McDade, Texas. \u201cThe world leaders know Trump is a buffoon, no surprise there. But the lesson that will hurt the U.S.A. maybe forever is that we are no longer trustworthy. Regardless of what happens to Trump or his successors, the simple fact remains that the American voters can elect a moron at any time, who can wreak havoc on any agreement. So why bother to negotiate treaties?\n\n\u201cThat damage has occurred and is irrevocable,\u201d Musgrave continued. \u201cI am sad for my country\u2019s ruined reputation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about when the president invited the Russian ambassador, his entourage, and Russian press (disallowing American press) into the Oval Office, disparaged just-fired FBI Director James Comey, and blabbed state secrets?\u201d asked Vicki Brown of Superior, Montana.\n\nJamie Alley of Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, wrote:\n\nAs a Canadian reader of the The Atlantic, here are three more unthinkables. Trump calls Canada a national-security threat as justification for his tariffs on steel and aluminum, causing havoc in cross-border trade and resulting in huge economic pain to both countries. A top Trump official says there\u2019s a \u201cspecial place in hell\u201d for the Canadian prime minister. No correction from the president. Imagine if the situation had been reversed. All Trudeau said was that he would always act in the interest of Canadians. After the U.S. requested that Canada arrest the Chinese business executive Meng Wanzhou, the CFO of Huawei, causing China to retaliate by arresting Canadians in China, Trump says he might use the Huawei executive as a bargaining chip in trade negotiations, leaving Canada out to dry for living up to our extradition treaty obligations.\n\n\u201cAs an Australian,\u201d Ian Burns wrote, \u201cI would add the disgraceful manner in which Trump treated our then\u2013prime minister on their first telephone call.\u201d"

    "title": "Huawei Exec Has Strong Case Against Extradition Thanks to Trump, Diplomat Says",
    "text": "Donald Trump and Meng Wanzhou. Images via CP/Wikipedia Commons\n\nThis article originally appeared on VICE Canada.\n\nCanada\u2019s ambassador to China says the Huawei executive arrested at the request of the US has \u201cquite good arguments on her side\u201d to fight extradition, including political involvement from President Donald Trump.\n\nMeng Wanzhou, a 46-year-old chief financial officer for the Chinese telecom giant was arrested in Vancouver last month, sparking diplomatic tensions between China and Canada.\n\nThe US accuses her of banking fraud involving a company called Skycom, a \u201chidden\u201d subsidiary of Huawei that did business in Iran, in violation of the US\u2019 sanctions against the country.\n\nIn a press conference with members of the Chinese-language media in Markham on Tuesday, Canada\u2019s ambassador to China John McCallum unexpectedly offering legal advice to Meng, outlined three arguments that she could use to fight extradition.\n\n\"One, political involvement by comments from Donald Trump in her case. Two, there's an extraterritorial aspect to her case, and three, there's the issue of Iran sanctions which are involved in her case, and Canada does not sign on to these Iran sanctions. So I think she has some strong arguments that she can make before a judge,\" McCallum said in his opening remarks.\n\nTrump said in an interview last month that he would intervene in the case against Meng if it would help him secure a trade deal with Beijing.\n\n\u201cIf I think it\u2019s good for the country, if I think it\u2019s good for what will be certainly the largest trade deal ever made\u2014which is a very important thing\u2014what\u2019s good for national security\u2014I would certainly intervene if I thought it was necessary,\u201d Trump told Reuters, adding that she could potentially be released.\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s possible that a lot of different things could happen. It\u2019s also possible it will be a part of negotiations. But we\u2019ll speak to the Justice Department, we\u2019ll speak to them, we\u2019ll get a lot of people involved,\u201d he said.\n\nRoland Paris, a former foreign policy advisor to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and an international affairs professor at the University of Ottawa, told VICE News he expects Meng\u2019s lawyers to use all three defenses proposed by McCallum.\n\n\u201cIf they do, it will be up to the court to assess whether Mr. Trump\u2019s comments raise doubts about the US extradition request,\u201d he said.\n\nMcCallum said on Tuesday that the federal government has not been involved, and that it\u2019s a judge at the British Columbia Supreme Court who will ultimately decide whether or not Meng will be extradited.\n\n\"It's purely a judicial process. There may come a time when the justice minister is required to give a view, but that will not be for some months to come,\" he said.\n\n\"I know this has angered China, but we have a system of extradition treaty, a system of rules of law, which are above the government. The government cannot change these things, and as I said, I think Ms. Meng has quite a strong case.\"\n\nThe United States does plan to file a formal extradition request, according to Canada\u2019s ambassador to the US David McNaughton, who told The Globe and Mail that he had expressed Canada\u2019s anger to the US about what has happened since Meng\u2019s arrest\u2014two Canadians have been detained in China, and another has been sentenced to death by a Chinese court.\n\n\"We don\u2019t like that it is our citizens who are being punished,\u201d MacNaughton told the Globe. \"[The Americans] are the ones seeking to have the full force of American law brought against [Ms. Meng] and yet we are the ones who are paying the price. Our citizens are.\u201d\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get the best of VICE delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nFollow Tamara Khandaker on Twitter."

    "title": "Treasury yields stage late-day surge on U.S.-China trade optimism",
    "text": "Treasury yields rose Thursday as stocks mounted a late-session rally after reports that the U.S. was debating ending tariffs on Chinese imports helped ease fears around a potential trade war.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.00% rose 1.8 basis points to 2.747%, after briefly touching an intraday low of 2.699%. The 2-year note yield TMUBMUSD02Y, +0.00% picked up 1.9 basis points to 2.564%, from a session low of 2.520%, while the 30-year bond yield TMUBMUSD30Y, +0.00% was mostly unchanged at 3.075%, around its highest levels since Dec. 18. Bond prices move in the opposite direction of yields.\n\nStocks received a lift from a report by The Wall Street Journal saying U.S. officials were considering rolling back import levies on Chinese goods to calm markets and ease trade tensions. The U.S. Treasury Department said that no recommendations on tariffs had been made. Both Beijing and Washington are looking to resolve current negotiations before a March deadline, when tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese imports are slated to rise to 25% from 10%.\n\nBond yields rose as they took their cue from U.S. equities, with the S&P 500 SPX, +1.09% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.74% posting solid gains.\n\nChina\u2019s chief trade negotiator Liu He will go to Washington in a few weeks for talks starting Jan. 30.\n\n\u201cThere will be progress when a high-level Chinese delegation visits Washington at the end of this month, but getting a deal before an early March deadline is an uphill battle. An extension is likely, which probably would delay the threatened U.S. 25% tariffs on a wide range of Chinese products,\u201d said Greg Valliere, chief global strategist at Horizon Investments, in a note.\n\nYet earlier in the day, investors were worried about intensifying trade tensions after the Justice Department had reportedly put Huawei under investigation for allegedly stealing trade secrets from T-Mobile. The case comes in the wake of the arrest of the telecoms firm\u2019s chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou in Canada in early December at the request of the U.S. for alleged bank fraud.\n\nYields initially rose after the January reading for the Philadelphia Fed\u2019s manufacturing survey jumped to 17.0 from 9.1 in December. The data helped to counter fears around tariff-related weakness in U.S. factories, especially after sharp drops in other widely followed manufacturing gauges.\n\n\u201dThis report should lessen fears that growth is suddenly weakening sharply,\u201d wrote Jim O\u2019 Sullivan, chief U.S. economist for High Frequency Economics.\n\nPolitical jitters from Washington showed few signs of disappearing as the government shutdown resulted in federal workers missing paychecks and a growing backlog of economic data that has yet to be released. Analysts warn the data is likely to be distorted once it comes out.\n\nSee: Why stock-market investors may soon need to worry about the government shutdown\n\nThough, the coming data has been thinned out, investors had some information on the economy\u2019s health to digest on Thursday. First-time claims for unemployment benefits declined by 3,000 to 213,000 in the week ended Jan. 12, below the 220,000 consensus forecast produced by a MarketWatch survey of economists.\n\nProviding critical information for the U.S. trading day.

    "text": "FILE PHOTO: Meng Wanzhou, Huawei Technologies Co Ltd's chief financial officer (CFO), is seen in this undated handout photo obtained by Reuters December 6, 2018. Huawei/Handout via REUTERS/File photo\n\n(Reuters) - The United States will proceed with the formal extradition from Canada of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou, Canada's ambassador to the United States told the Globe and Mail, as Beijing vowed to respond to Washington's actions.\n\nDavid MacNaughton, in an interview with the Canadian newspaper published on Monday, said the United States has told Canada it will request Meng's extradition, but he did not say when the request will be made.\n\nThe deadline for filing is Jan. 30, or 60 days after Meng was arrested on Dec. 1 in Vancouver.\n\nMeng, the daughter of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd founder Ren Zhengfei, was arrested at the request of the United States over alleged violations of U.S. sanctions on Iran. She was released on bail last month and is due in court in Vancouver on Feb. 6.\n\nRelations between China and Canada turned frosty after the arrest, with China detaining two Canadian citizens and sentencing to death a Canadian man previously found guilty of drug smuggling.\n\nBeijing has not tied any of the three Canadians' cases to Meng's arrest, but has warned of severe consequences if she was not immediately released. Western and former Canadian diplomats have said they have no doubt the cases are linked.\n\nHuawei, the world's biggest maker of telecommunications equipment, said it had no comment on ongoing legal proceedings when contacted by Reuters on Tuesday. A U.S. Justice Department spokesman said: \"We will comment through our filings.\"\n\nThe Canadian Justice Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside regular business hours.\n\nChina's Foreign Ministry on Tuesday reiterated calls for Meng's immediate release and said her case clearly was \"not a regular judicial case\".\n\nAnyone with fair judgment would determine that Canada made a \"serious mistake\" in this matter, ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular news briefing.\n\n\"Canada and the United States arbitrarily abused their bilateral extradition treaty to seriously infringe upon a Chinese citizen's security and legal rights,\" Hua said.\n\nChina \"strongly urges\" the United States to correct its \"mistake\", cancel the arrest order for Meng, and not make a formal extradition request, she added.\n\nAsked if China would retaliate against the United States if Meng is extradited, Hua said, \"China will, of course, respond to U.S. actions.\" She did not elaborate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"PAYING THE PRICE\"\n\nCanada is one of over 100 countries with which the United States has extradition treaties.\n\nOnce a formal request is received, a Canadian court must determine within 30 days if there is sufficient evidence to support extradition, and Canada's Minister of Justice must give a formal order.\n\nIn an article published on Monday, a former Canadian spy chief said Canada should ban Huawei from supplying equipment for next-generation telecoms networks, while Canada's government is studying any security implications.\n\nSome of Canada's allies such as the United States and Australia have already imposed restrictions on using Huawei equipment, citing the risk of it being used for espionage.\n\nHuawei has repeatedly said such concerns are unfounded, while China's ambassador to Canada last week said there would be repercussions if Ottawa blocked Huawei.\n\nIn Monday's interview, MacNaughton said he had complained to the United States that Canada was suffering from Chinese revenge for an arrest made at the U.S.'s request.\n\n\"We don't like that it is our citizens who are being punished,\" the Globe and Mail cited MacNaughton as saying. \"(The Americans) are the ones seeking to have the full force of American law brought against (Ms. Meng) and yet we are the ones who are paying the price. Our citizens are.\"\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau previously said China was arbitrarily using the death penalty and called on world leaders to raise concerns about the detained Canadians.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Sijia Jiang in HONG KONG, Michael Martina and Christian Shepherd in BEIJING and Rishika Chatterjee in BENGALURU; Additional reporting by Karen Freifeld in WASHINGTON and Amran Abocar in TORONTO; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier and Christopher Cushing)"

    "text": "Meng Wanzhou (R), Chief Financial Officer of Huawei Technologies, answers the door on December 12, 2018 after she was released on bail in Vancouver, British Columbia (AFP Photo/Jason Redmond)\n\nThe extradition hearing for a top Huawei executive at the center of a diplomatic row between Ottawa and Beijing was pushed back to March on Tuesday, after the US unveiled sweeping charges against her and the Chinese tech giant.\n\nMeng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer and the daughter of its founder, was indicted along with Huawei and two affiliates in a US case related to alleged Iran sanctions violations that has inflamed tensions with China.\n\nShe was arrested at Washington's request on December 1 as she changed planes in Vancouver, and was later released on bail pending a decision on extradition to the US.\n\nIn Meng's first court appearance since being released, the judge moved the start of her extradition hearing to March 6, a month later than previously scheduled, in order to allow the defense time to review the evidence in the case.\n\nExtradition cases can take months or years, noted David Lametti, Canada's new attorney general.\n\n\"By the time all the individual's rights are exhausted, they can actually take a long time,\" he told journalists in Ottawa.\n\nAt the end of the process, if a judge orders an extradition, the attorney general would have the \"final say,\" he added.\n\nThe case has drawn Canada into an escalating diplomatic crisis with Beijing, which has detained two Canadians in what was widely seen as an act of retaliation for Meng's arrest.\n\nOver the weekend, Canada sacked its ambassador to China after he said that he believed the US extradition request was flawed.\n\nChina reacted furiously to the US criminal charges, saying they were the product of \"strong political motivations and political manipulations.\"\n\nThe company also denied any wrongdoing.\n\nCanadian officials have confirmed to AFP that they received a formal extradition request from the US.\n\nThe US Justice Department has announced 13 charges against Meng, Huawei and two affiliates.\n\nThe indictment was unsealed as China's top trade negotiator arrived in Washington for high-stakes talks with US officials, which could complicate efforts to avert a deepening of their trade war.\n\nIn addition, 10 US federal charges were filed against two Huawei affiliates for allegedly stealing technology from T-Mobile.\n\n- 'Brazen and persistent' -\n\nFBI Director Christopher Wray said both sets of charges \"expose Huawei's brazen and persistent actions to exploit American companies and financial institutions, and to threaten the free and fair global marketplace.\"\n\nBut acting US Attorney General Matthew Whitaker said there was nothing in the indictment that alleged Chinese government involvement in either case.\n\nThe Chinese foreign ministry accused Washington of using \"state power to discredit and crack down on specific Chinese companies in an attempt to strangle the enterprises' legitimate and legal operations.\"\n\nIt renewed Beijing's demand for the US to drop its warrant against Meng and for Canada to release her.\n\nThe accusations against Meng allege that between 2007 and 2017, she, Huawei and subsidiaries sought to mask their business with Iran in violation of US and UN sanctions on the country.\n\nMeng in particular \"repeatedly lied\" to bankers about the relationships between the companies, especially with Skycom, a Huawei affiliate in Iran, according to the charges.\n\nThat violated US laws, the Justice Department said, because the Iran business involved US-dollar transactions processed by banks through the United States.\n\nHuawei and the affiliates also lied to US authorities, obstructing the investigation, they said.\n\nThe second case charged that Huawei made a concerted effort to steal technology related to a phone-testing robot dubbed Tappy from a T-Mobile USA lab in Washington state."
