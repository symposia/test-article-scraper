This without even counting the dead for lack of medicines and security.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo the generals,\u201d he added, \u201chow is it that having the power to allow the entry of international humanitarian aid to our country to save lives, you would decide not to?

    "text": "The Venezuelan political opposition and its many foreign supporters, the United States first among them, gambled that getting crucial humanitarian aid into the country would undermine military support for Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and finally pry him out of the presidential palace. Alas, the first round failed recently. Despite some reported defections, the army blocked the aid at border crossings, often with violent confrontations.\n\nNow what?\n\nThe easy part is to identify approaches best avoided. President Trump claims he has a Plan B, \u201cand C, and D, and E, and F\u201d to evict Mr. Maduro, but the only one he has raised is military intervention. His hawkish lieutenants at the White House may support that, but it is a dangerous idea opposed by most of the 50 countries that have joined the United States in recognizing the opposition leader, Juan Guaid\u00f3, as the interim president of Venezuela. Whatever Venezuelan soldiers may think of Mr. Maduro, the deplorable history of United States interventions in the Americas could well unite them \u2014 and many Venezuelans \u2014 against another one.\n\nMore sanctions are another possibility. But the United States imposed new sanctions against Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil company in January, further reducing what little remains of the country\u2019s oil income. Prolonged and expanded sanctions, while achieving the goal of depriving the government of cash, would also impose more suffering on a population already on the brink, with desperate shortages of food and medicine and runaway inflation.\n\nAnd a dictator who has already destroyed his country \u2014 and has the support of Russia and China \u2014 is not one who gives a fig for the suffering of his people, a sizable portion of whom still harbor an attachment to the \u201cBolivarian socialist\u201d claptrap of his predecessor and mentor, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez.",

    "text": "The majority of democracies in the Western world have deemed the elections held on May 20 as fraudulent and illegal. The National Assembly, which is the only democratically elected institution remaining in the country, was right to designate Juan Guaid\u00f3 as Venezuela\u2019s interim president. Questioning his legitimacy is tantamount to questioning democracy. It is a mind-boggling paradox, indeed. Mr. Maduro\u2019s opposition is demanding that he comply with the Bolivarian Constitution established during Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s leadership, and Mr. Maduro is violating it at every turn.\n\nWe now have an opportunity to restore democracy in Venezuela. This will not be an easy task. Mr. Maduro wields the power of weapons, while the National Assembly has legitimacy, but lacks the influence and authority that come from its government institutions. How can this impossible imbalance be corrected?\n\nFirst, with solid, unflinching unity. The democratic countries that have recognized Mr. Guaid\u00f3 must reinforce his political legitimacy as well as his authority over Venezuela\u2019s economic assets, both in and out of the country. This will cut off Mr. Maduro\u2019s access to the resources he uses to oppress the Venezuelan people, and will communicate very clearly to his supporters (particularly those in the military) that endorsing him is a dead end.\n\nSecond, the conflict must be guided back to its original, regional scale. Venezuela must not become yet another front in the newfangled mini Cold War that the United States and Russia have been waging in places like Ukraine and Syria. The United States, Russia and China must avoid using Venezuela as a proxy in a geopolitical power struggle. By not interfering they can prevent a stalemate that could give Mr. Maduro time and resources to cling to power.\n\nManagement of the Venezuelan crisis should be left in the hands of key regional stakeholders. The European Union, with the support of Canada, should create the space and conditions so that the Lima Group, which comprises 14 countries from the Americas, may decide a course of action. They should recruit the Mexican president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, to support the cause of democracy in Venezuela, and make the Cuban regime understand that it cannot continue to intervene in Venezuela and leech off its resources.",

    "text": "By late 2017, the inflation rate exceeded 50 percent a month. It was a turning point: economists signaled that we were officially in hyperinflation. Inflation is bad, but hyperinflation is a totally different game.\n\nHyperinflation hits the poorest the hardest. Venezuelans have reported losing on average 24 pounds in body weight. Nearly 90 percent now live in poverty. In the slums of Caracas, I visited mothers who have gone from reducing their children\u2019s portions to having them skip meals altogether.\n\nMarilyn Alma, a mother of three, had to give up custody of her eldest child because she can no longer feed him. One week, a dozen eggs cost Alba three days of wages; the next week, the cost doubles. Eggs, the cheapest source of protein, are now a distant dream for the vast majority of people. Ms. Alma, who had once been a staunch government supporter, told me, \u201cMaduro betrayed this country.\u201d\n\nThe professional class has also been affected. In middle-class neighborhoods large supermarkets previously stocked with imported goods are now half stocked with cheaper versions. Professionals can only afford two or three food items, and retirees often must leave behind products they can no longer afford. Their life savings and pensions are suddenly worthless.\n\nHyperinflation has also meant a brain drain. Young engineers or doctors are now working as waiters in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, or as store clerks in Lima, Peru. \u201cThe worst part is that they send back money to help us,\u201d Melani Delgado, whose two sons have left, told me recently as she fought back tears. A part-time dentist, Delgado said she could once afford to send her children to private university on her salary. Today remittances are fast becoming a lifeline for those left behind. \u201cThis government broke up the Venezuelan family and turned parents into parasites,\u201d she said.\n\nIf you belong to the dwindling minority that has access to dollars, you can somewhat offset the rise in prices with the surge in the black-market exchange. You may be able to survive, but it\u2019s impossible to plan for something that changes every day. To adapt to the destruction all around you.\n\nFor those with access to dollars, living with hyperinflation is demoralizing. At 6,000 bol\u00edvars (the equivalent of $2, or one third of the minimum monthly wage ), a pound of butter is obscenely expensive. Paying $30 for a 17-ounce bottle of olive oil feels criminal. Today this bottle costs the equivalent of five times the minimum wage, but that\u2019s likely to change tomorrow. \u201cBeating the system\u201d feels like you are eviscerating your country\u2019s economy.",

I asked if we were being detained. They said no \u2014 but still they didn\u2019t let us leave the room.\n\nFinally they told Mar\u00eda and me to join our colleagues on the bus.

    "title": "How to Tackle Venezuela\u2019s Military Problem",
    "description": "Venezuelan soldiers and militia members were filmed by the state last month to show their strength and their support for President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.",
    "text": "Before the 2000s, the possibility of this type of diversity within the military was hardly discussed in military politics textbooks. Today, this diversity, or what political scientists are calling the new oligopoly of state violence, is what undemocratic regimes and failed states prefer. And in Venezuela, this oligopoly is dominated by the criminal-minded soldiers and killing agents.\n\nKilling agents in particular have become the hallmark of Mr. Maduro\u2019s rule. They comprise two groups: the Special Actions Forces, or FAES, created in 2017 to combat crime but in reality charged with conducting politically motivated killings in poor neighborhoods, and the so-called colectivos, armed civilians paid by the government. In the early 2000s, colectivos were community-organized reservists. Today they consist mostly of delinquents, thugs and even former inmates. They show up on motorcycles at protests, gun in hand and with their faces covered, to terrorize participants. Colectivos spare professional soldiers from the need to repress.\n\nThe problem with Mr. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s strategy \u2014 in fact, any peaceful and democratic strategy to demilitarize a regime \u2014 is that it cannot easily address the concerns of these disparate military groups.\n\nSome can be addressed with policies already offered by the interim president. For instance, Mr. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s offer of transitional justice (amnesty) with fair elections has enormous appeal to scared soldiers and many professional soldiers. This is why we are seeing defections by many of these soldiers.\n\nBut there is little in Mr. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s policies that would appeal to hard-core ideologues, for-profit and criminal soldiers, and colectivos. Hard-core ideologues are likely to stand with Mr. Maduro unconditionally. The for-profit generals will gain little from transitional justice: They will be left without status and profits even if their transgressions are forgiven. And the colectivos are especially hard to deal with because they are the least controllable group \u2014 they are too decentralized and have no corporate interest to defend.\n\nTransitioning to democracy in Venezuela will require putting order to this fragmented military. The darkest groups within this institution cannot be invited to join a democratic movement \u2014 that would produce an instant conflict of interest. Instead, these groups need to be neutralized somehow.\n\nA civilian alone cannot do it. Only actors from within the military establishment \u2014 those who know the identities of the armed actors within their ranks, their businesses and deals \u2014 can do the revamping of the military that is needed.",

    "title": "The Sanders Foreign Policy Advantage",
    "description": "He has put forward a comprehensive vision that pits democratic peoples everywhere against illiberalism at home and abroad.",
    "text": "In his Johns Hopkins address, Sanders offered a big-picture reading of this moment in international relations. For him, the ideological struggle of the 21st century doesn\u2019t pit a liberal, democratic America against illiberal, authoritarian opponents, but instead pits liberal, democratic peoples everywhere against illiberalism at home and abroad. It\u2019s a \u201cworldwide movement toward authoritarianism, oligarchy and kleptocracy\u201d against one toward \u201cstrengthening democracy, egalitarianism, and economic, social, racial and environmental justice.\u201d In this conception of the world, President Trump is just one of many \u201cdemagogues who exploit people\u2019s fears, prejudices and grievances to gain and hold on to power.\u201d\n\nThese movements don\u2019t emerge out of nothing. Sanders contends that they are fueled by the enormous disparities of wealth and opportunity that define global capitalism. This is the subject of his Westminster College speech \u2014 an attempt to link domestic economic issues to relations among states. \u201cThis planet will not be secure or peaceful when so few have so much, and so many have so little \u2014 and when we advance day after day into an oligarchic form of society where a small number of extraordinarily powerful special interests exert enormous influence over the economic and political life of the world,\u201d Sanders said, adding later that \u201cinequality, corruption, oligarchy and authoritarianism are inseparable.\u201d\n\nAs for culprits, Sanders has a list. His Johns Hopkins address lists Vladimir Putin of Russia, Viktor Orban of Hungary, Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil, Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia as part of this global nexus of corruption and autocracy. He also singles out American billionaires like Robert Mercer and Sheldon Adelson for \u201cpromoting a shared agenda of intolerance and bigotry\u201d as part of a \u201ccommon front\u201d of authoritarianism. And while Sanders was silent on Venezuela in these speeches, he has criticized the government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in other venues, attacking its authoritarianism and suppression of democracy while rejecting intervention by the United States.\n\nIf these are the conditions of international relations, then the aim of American foreign policy should be to stand against this rising tide of illiberalism and oligarchy. For Sanders, the United States must create a global order that can constrain authoritarian states and bring democratic accountability to global capitalism. It must also embrace the cooperation necessary for tackling climate change and other transnational challenges, building \u201cpartnerships not just between governments, but between peoples\u201d and recognizing that \u201cour safety and welfare is bound up with the safety and welfare of others around the world.\u201d\n\nFor this project to succeed, however, Americans must also strive for fairness and equality in their own country. \u201cIf we are going to expound the virtues of democracy and justice abroad, and be taken seriously, we need to practice those values here at home,\u201d Sanders says.",

There are direct commercial flights from Bogot\u00e1 and Panama City.\n\nHow likely is his arrest?\n\nFlouting the travel ban imposed by Venezuela's highest court is likely to get Mr Guaid\u00f3 into trouble.\n\nPresident Maduro has hinted at such. \"He can't come and go, the justice system had banned him from leaving the country. I respect the laws,\" he told ABC last week.\n\nThe Venezuelan government has in the past not been shy to arrest opposition leaders. Lawmaker Juan Requesens has been in jail since August over his alleged role in a drone attack on President Maduro. Others have left the country for fear of arrest.\n\nHowever, when the secret police arrested Mr Guaid\u00f3 on 13 January, he was released after half an hour.\n\nCommunications Minister Jorge Rodr\u00edguez said that arrest was \"irregular\" and the agents involved were dismissed.\n\nMr Guaid\u00f3 appears willing to face the risk of arrest, saying: \"If the regime dares, of course, to kidnap us, it will be the last mistake they make.\"\n\nHe also tweeted [in Spanish] that he had left instructions for his international allies for \"a clear route to follow\" should he be detained.\n\nWhat would be the likely reaction to his arrest?\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Threats have been made against Juan Guaid\u00f3 and his family, the Lima Group says\n\nArresting Mr Guaid\u00f3 would cause a huge outcry.\n\nUS National Security Adviser John Bolton wrote of a \"strong and significant response\" on Twitter.\n\nSkip Twitter post by @AmbJohnBolton Venezuelan Interim President Juan Guaido has announced his planned return to Venezuela.

CNN's team in Ure\u00f1a, Venezuela, saw dozens of people throwing rocks toward Venezuela's National Guard, who fired back with rubber bullets. There was no report on injuries.\n\nRodriguez said that the country's security forces had protected the border in \"exemplary\" fashion.\n\nBut Bachelet, the UN official, described \"disgraceful scenes.\" \"The Venezuelan government must stop its forces from using excessive force against unarmed protesters and ordinary citizens,\" she said.\n\nIn a statement Sunday, UN Secretary General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said he is \"following with increasing concern\" the tensions in Venezuela.\n\nGuterres called \"for violence to be avoided\" and \"for lethal force not to be used in any circumstances.\"\n\nMaduro defiant\n\nMeantime, Colombia's customs agency said Sunday that 104 members of Venezuela's security forces have defected, entering Colombia. The development is a sign that Maduro's grip on the military -- control of which is seen as integral to forcing new elections -- could be waning.\n\nBut Maduro put out a defiant message Sunday.\n\nEl pueblo est\u00e1 unido en las calles, movilizado y alerta en todos los rincones del pa\u00eds. Llamo a los hombres y mujeres de buena voluntad, a no bajar la guardia y a mantenerse en pie de lucha para preservar la Paz de Venezuela. \u00a1Viva la Patria Rebelde! pic.twitter.com/5e4BxT6okx \u2014 Nicol\u00e1s Maduro (@NicolasMaduro) February 24, 2019\n\n\"The people are united in the streets, mobilized and alert in every corner of the country,\" he said on Twitter. \"I call on men and women of goodwill, not to lower their guard and to stay in the fight to preserve Venezuela's peace.

Off with the chains!\"\n\nThe anthem may reference Venezuela's colonial history, but the wording is particularly fitting for today's politics too.\n\nVenezuelans are joining in the modern-day fight to shake off President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's administration, a government that many blame for strangling the economy and people's lives.\n\nThis meeting - and many similar events across the country - is being held ahead of a deadline set by opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 for humanitarian aid to be brought into the country from abroad.\n\nMr Guaid\u00f3, head of the National Assembly and self-declared interim president, and his supporters are trying to gather a million volunteers.\n\nImage caption Volunteers gather in Caracas ahead of Saturday's deadline\n\nThey want to spread the word about how important this humanitarian aid is.\n\nIt does not sound like many in this meeting need convincing.

Mr Maduro, who is backed by China, Russia and Cuba, insists he is the only legitimate president.\n\nVenezuela's political crisis has been sparked by an economic meltdown in which hyperinflation has hit salaries and savings, leading many to flee the country.\n\nWhat did Guaid\u00f3 say on his return?\n\nMr Guaid\u00f3 was received at the Sim\u00f3n Bolivar International airport by diplomats from the US and EU nations and a crowd of supporters who chanted \"Guaid\u00f3, Guaid\u00f3\" and \"Yes we can\".\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Juan Guaid\u00f3 told supporters that the government's \"chain of command\" was broken\n\nAccompanied by his wife, Mr Guaid\u00f3 then travelled to an avenue in the eastern Caracas district of Las Mercedes to address an anti-government rally. While outside the country he had used social media to urge his supporters to gather.\n\nAfter saying that he had been threatened with \"jail, death\" before his return, Mr Guaid\u00f3 said he had been treated well on his arrival at the airport. He said immigration officers even greeted him at the airport with the words \"welcome, president\".\n\n\"It is evident that after the threats, somebody did not follow orders. Many did not follow orders. The chain of command [in the government security forces] is broken,\" he told the crowd.\n\nHe called for nationwide protests on Saturday.\n\n\"On Saturday we'll continue in the streets, all of Venezuela will return to the streets, decided and determined to mobilise in search of their freedom. We will not rest one second until freedom is achieved.\"\n\nAnd he paid tribute to those who lost their lives in clashes at the Brazil-Venezuela border when an attempted aid delivery was blocked from entering the country by the Venezuelan military.\n\n'Return puts Maduro in a bind'\n\nBy Will Grant, BBC News, Caracas\n\nJuan Guaid\u00f3's car could barely move in the final few streets towards the rally. And the noise that greeted his arrival when he took to the stage was deafening.\n\nWhat will have pleased those supporters most wasn't just that he was back on Venezuelan soil, but the nature of his entry. Rather than slipping in over the border in the dead of night, he walked straight up to immigration in the main airport in Caracas and back into the country.\n\nWithin the crowd, you could find the two extreme positions on what Mr Guaid\u00f3 should do next, from openly backing a US-led military intervention to a peaceful and negotiated resolution to the conflict. What they all agree on however, is that President Maduro must go.\n\nAs for Mr Maduro, he finds himself in a difficult bind. Having watched Mr Guaid\u00f3 thumb his nose at the Supreme Court's travel ban and at his government more generally, he must decide whether to arrest his opponent for leaving the country. He will be fully aware that Washington has repeatedly warned him against doing so and that the potential consequences would be serious.\n\nWhat if he is arrested?\n\nArresting Mr Guaid\u00f3 would cause a huge outcry.\n\nShortly before his return on Monday, US Vice President Mike Pence sent a warning to Mr Maduro, saying any threats against Mr Guaid\u00f3 \"will not be tolerated and will be met with swift response\".\n\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo later reinforced this view later, congratulating Mr Guaid\u00f3 on his \"successful diplomatic efforts in the region and safe return to Venezuela\" in a statement.\n\n\"The United States and freedom-loving nations around the world stand with interim president Guaid\u00f3, the National Assembly and all democratic forces as they work to establish free and fair elections that will return democracy to Venezuela,\" he added.\n\n\"The international community must unite and push for the end of Maduro's brutal regime and the peaceful restoration of democracy in Venezuela.\"\n\nEU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini has said that any measure that put at risk Mr Guaid\u00f3's \"freedom, safety or personal integrity would represent a major escalation of tensions\".\n\nDiplomats from the Lima Group, a bloc of 14 Western countries created to tackle the Venezuelan crisis, has said that \"serious and credible threats\" had been made against the life of Mr Guaid\u00f3.\n\nIt said \"any violent actions against Guaid\u00f3, his wife, or family\" would be met by all \"legal and political mechanisms\".\n\nHow secure is Maduro?\n\nWhile international pressure on President Maduro has steadily increased, the Venezuelan leader has dismissed all calls for him to step down and denounced them as attempted coups d'\u00e9tat.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption President Maduro says that he is facing \"imperialist aggression\"\n\nAccording to Colombian migration officials, more than 500 soldiers have deserted from the Venezuelan army over the past weeks.\n\nWhile this is a sign that lower-ranking soldiers are suffering the same hardships - shortages of food and medicine - as the general population and are willing to follow the more than three million people who have left Venezuela over the past years, there is no sign yet of a general switch in loyalty.\n\nGovernment loyalists also still control much of the judiciary and the National Constituent Assembly, a body Mr Maduro set up to bypass the opposition-controlled legislative.\n\nHowever, there are unconfirmed reports that Diosdado Cabello, the National Constituent Assembly head, has sent his two children to Hong Kong, which the opposition thinks is a sign of growing nervousness.\n\nThe government also appears to be feeling the sanctions imposed by the US. Reuters reported last week it had taken eight tonnes of gold from the Central Bank to sell abroad to raise badly needed cash.",

    "text": "CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido told a huge rally of supporters on Tuesday that humanitarian aid would enter the country on Feb. 23, setting the stage for a showdown with President Nicolas Maduro who has refused to let supplies in.\n\nVenezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, who many nations have recognized as the country's rightful interim ruler, speaks as he attends a rally to commemorate the Day of the Youth and to protest against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's government in Caracas, Venezuela February 12, 2019. REUTERS/Manaure Quintero\n\nTens of thousands of protesters had taken to the streets to demand that Maduro allow aid into Venezuela, where food and medicine shortages are rife.\n\nGuaido invoked a constitutional provision to assume the presidency three weeks ago, arguing that Maduro\u2019s re-election last year was a sham. Most Western countries, including the United States, have recognized Guaido as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate head of state, but Maduro retains the backing of Russia and China as well as control of state institutions including the military.\n\nAn aid convoy supplied by the United States and Colombia arrived in the Colombian border town of Cucuta last week, where it is being held in warehouses. A Venezuelan opposition envoy has also said Brazil\u2019s government would try to get humanitarian aid to the border.\n\nMaduro has denounced the aid as a U.S.-orchestrated show to overthrow his socialist government and said it will not be let into the country. He has demanded instead that Washington lift economic sanctions that it has ratcheted up in recent weeks.\n\nOn Tuesday, Guaido said he was issuing a \u201cdirect order\u201d to the armed forces to allow the aid in, though so far there are not clear signs the military would disobey Maduro. Guaido did not specify from where aid would enter, but said the opposition would go in a convoy to safeguard the supplies.\n\n\u201cPut yourselves on the side of the constitution, but also on the side of humanity,\u201d Guaido said, in a message directed at the military. \u201cFeb. 23 will be the day for the humanitarian aid to enter Venezuela, so from today we will have to get organized.\u201d\n\nDraped in Venezuelan flags, his supporters carried signs saying \u201cNo more dictatorship,\u201d and \u201cLeave the country, damned tyrant.\u201d One bore a wooden cross to symbolize how Maduro was \u201ccrucifying the Venezuelans,\u201d he said.\n\nJuan Carlos Bolivar said he wanted the government out, adding that his 49-year old sister had uterine cancer and had not been treated for six months because of a lack of medicine.\n\n\u201cWe have brought her home because the hospitals are collapsed. We are waiting for humanitarian aid to see if this medicine arrives,\u201d he said.\n\nMaduro denies there is a humanitarian crisis and says Venezuelans are not beggars. He addressed a smaller rally of several thousand government supporters in Caracas on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe all want peace for Venezuela and for the drums of war to go away,\u201d he told a crowd that included many public employees, some holding \u201cDefend the Country\u201d banners.\n\nThe administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has said all options are on the table for Venezuela and has not ruled out military intervention, although it says its aim is \u201ca peaceful transfer of power.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are here supporting the revolution, we are against the invasion the gringos want,\u201d said Marcos Velasquez, 32, a worker at the food ministry.\n\nPOLITICIZING AID?\n\nGuaido, who has galvanized the opposition after several years of in-fighting and government crackdowns, vows to keep calling protests to pressure Maduro to step down so new presidential elections can be held.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be on the streets until this is over,\u201d said Cecilia Navarrete, 50, at his rally on Tuesday. Her brother, sister and father are among the estimated several million who have emigrated in recent years, fleeing the crisis.\n\nOn Venezuela\u2019s border with Colombia, smaller opposition protests formed. In the town of Urena, across from Cucuta, several hundred people dressed in white danced in the streets, waving flags and chanting profanities against top government officials.\n\n\u201cWe want a prosperous Venezuela, as it was before,\u201d said Mery Marin, a 25-year-old electrician.\n\nSlideshow (19 Images)\n\nMaduro\u2019s adversaries say he has run roughshod over democratic institutions and ravaged the nation\u2019s economy through nationalizations and a corruption-riddled exchange control system.

REUTERS/Carlos Jass\n\nIn a report titled \u201cHunger, punishment and fear, the formula for repression in Venezuela,\u201d Amnesty said dozens died during five days of protests from Jan 21 to Jan 25, almost all from gunshot wounds, and 900 people were arrested.\n\nAmnesty called on the U.N. Human Rights Council to take action to address the \u201ctotal impunity that prevails in Venezuela\u201d by creating an independent investigative body to report on the human rights situation.\n\nThe protests were sparked by opposition leader Juan Guaido\u2019s call for people to demand a change in government after Maduro began a second term following a vote last year widely considered as fraudulent. Guaido on Jan. 23 invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency, though Maduro says Guaido is leading a U.S.-directed coup against him.\n\n\u201cThe authorities under Nicolas Maduro are trying to use fear and punishment to impose a repulsive strategy of social control against those who demand change,\u201d said Erika Guevara-Rosas, Americas director at Amnesty.\n\n\u201cHis government is attacking the most impoverished people that it claims to defend, but instead it murders, detains and threatens them.\u201d\n\nVenezuela\u2019s Information Ministry did not respond to a request to comment.\n\nAmnesty said state authorities carried out extrajudicial executions as a method of social control, mainly using the National Police\u2019s Special Actions Force (FAES) to target poor areas that had risen up against Maduro.\n\nThe FAES have carried out dozens of deadly raids in recent weeks. The unit has said reports of abuses are \u201cfake news\u201d spread by right-wing opponents and their \u201cstruggle is against all criminals that ravage our communities.\u201d\n\nAmnesty said 41 people had died, mostly from gunshot wounds, in protests in late January. It said it had documented six extrajudicial executions by the FAES of young men linked to the protests.\n\nIn one case in the city of Carora, Amnesty said, police beat up Luis Enrique Ramos Suarez, 29, at his home where 10 relatives were present, shot him dead and then staged a mock shoot out to cover up the killing.\n\nAmnesty recommended that prosecutors at the International Criminal Court should consider the facts in its report and possibly incorporate them in a preliminary examination already underway on Venezuela.",

    "title": "Exclusive: Meeting Maduro - Inside a U.S. businessman's oil deal with Venezuela",
    "description": "In November 2017, Harry Sargeant III, a wealthy American businessman, flew to Venezuela to see about buying some oil.",
    "text": "GULF STREAM, Fla. (Reuters) - In November 2017, Harry Sargeant III, a wealthy American businessman, flew to Venezuela to see about buying some oil.\n\nU.S. businessman Harry Sargeant III speaks about his dealings with Venezuela during an interview with Reuters at his home in Gulf Stream, Florida, U.S., February 7, 2019. Picture taken February 7, 2019. REUTERS/Joe Skipper\n\nSargeant, the former finance chairman of the Florida Republican Party, was looking to purchase a New Jersey asphalt plant that needed a steady supply of the heavy crude that Venezuela has in abundance.\n\nNever mind that the South American country was in the cross-hairs of the Trump administration.\n\nThe trip got off to a worrying start when Sargeant\u2019s plane was directed to a special hangar in Caracas and surrounded by soldiers. But what followed, he says, was privileged treatment, including an unexpected meeting the next day with Nicolas Maduro, Venezuela\u2019s socialist president.\n\nWithin a year, Sargeant had inked an attractive oilfield agreement to help raise plummeting crude production in Venezuela, whose economy is in a free fall. A new Delaware company called Erepla Services LLC, of which Sargeant is a shareholder, would rehabilitate three troubled oilfields in exchange for almost half the revenue.\n\n\u201cWe like high-risk places,\u201d said Sargeant, whose dealmaking has taken him to hot spots such as Iraq. The 61-year-old former Marine Corp pilot discussed the Venezuela deal with Reuters in an exclusive interview in the wood-paneled cigar room of his mansion in Gulf Stream, an affluent community on Florida\u2019s east coast.\n\nSargeant\u2019s timing for the venture turned out to be lousy: On January 28, just weeks after news broke of Sargeant\u2019s partnership with Petroleos de Venezuela SA (PDVSA), the U.S. government unleashed tough new sanctions banning Americans from working with Venezuela\u2019s state-run oil firm. It was part of a wider U.S. pressure campaign to topple Maduro\u2019s government.\n\nSargeant acknowledges sanctions have derailed his deal.\n\nStill his willingness to do business with a ruler the Trump administration seeks to undermine reflects a long tradition of oil companies making deals with disfavored governments around the world. Prior to the January sanctions, the United States had been the biggest cash-paying customer for Venezuela\u2019s oil, importing more than 500,000 barrels daily.\n\nThe intended partnership also highlights Venezuela\u2019s desperation. With Western oil majors steering clear of new investment there, the country has turned to China and Russia as well as upstart firms like Erepla. Maduro has long sought an end to what he calls an economic war being waged against his government by the United States. His embrace of an American company belies his public denunciations of Trump.\n\n\u201cThere is no doubt they wanted to send a message that Venezuela was open to American business,\u201d Sargeant said.\n\nThe Venezuelan government and PDVSA did not respond to emails requesting comment about the state oil company\u2019s deal with Erepla or Sargeant\u2019s version of events.\n\nFACE TO FACE WITH MADURO\n\nSargeant says his business dealings in Venezuela date to the late 1980s. A Sargeant family company claimed in court that it was forced out of Venezuela\u2019s asphalt business by PDVSA in 2005. And the firm, records show, once owed a $52 million judgment to PDVSA.\n\nHe says he decided to give the country another shot on his search for heavy crude because he still had industry contacts there.\n\nThe day after Sargeant\u2019s November 2017 arrival, he said, a small convoy of SUVs took him to a house at the Fuerte Tiuna military base in Caracas. Inside, he said officials showed off a room with various live snakes, some venomous, on display in glass cages.\n\nSargeant thought he would be meeting only with a PDVSA official he knew. Instead he said he found himself face-to-face with Maduro, whom he said was \u201cfriendly but serious.\u201d\n\nMaduro, he said, wanted him to explain why American companies were not investing in the oil sector there. And, with the help of a translator, the Venezuelan president waxed philosophical about the ravaged economy, Sargeant recalls.\n\n\u201cHe said China reinvented itself and the Venezuelans can reinvent themselves,\u201d Sargeant said.\n\nSargeant did not end up purchasing the New Jersey asphalt plant. Instead, a few months later, he and his team began discussing a production venture with PDVSA, according to Ali Rahman, a Washington DC-based executive at Erepla.\n\n\u201cWe went in saying \u2018Hey, we\u2019re an American oil company, we want to help revitalize the Venezuelan oil sector, and we want to do it waving the American flag.\u2019\u201d\n\nCONTROVERSIAL PAST\n\nSargeant\u2019s tolerance for risk-taking has taken him to hazardous corners of the globe where some of his business dealings have become tangled in investigations and lawsuits.\n\nDuring the height of the Iraq War, one of his firms, International Oil Trading Company (IOTC,) won lucrative contracts from the Defense Logistics Agency to supply the U.S. military with fuel.\n\nDisputes ensued at the Armed Forces Board of Contract Appeals. The U.S. government in the civil proceedings claimed IOTC used \u201cbribery and fraud\u201d to win permission from the nation of Jordan to transport oil across its territory. IOTC and Jordan denied those allegations at the time.\n\nEarly last year the U.S. government settled, and agreed to pay IOTC $40 million, in what Sargeant says is a full vindication.\n\nHis proposed deal with PDVSA is at odds with Republican Party efforts in his home state of Florida, a key battleground for the 2020 presidential election and where an estimated 200,000 Venezuelans have recently settled.\n\nTrump made an appeal to Venezuelan exiles at a recent rally in Florida, where he condemned Maduro\u2019s socialist government. Florida Senator Marco Rubio pushed for the U.S. ban on Venezuelan oil imports.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nNeither the White House or Rubio responded to a request for comment about Sargeant.\n\nSargeant insists it is not his concern who rules Venezuela.\n\n\u201cOur business is with PDVSA, the institution,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not into the politics of the situation.\u201d",

REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins\n\nThe six-person team was held for more than two hours in the Miraflores palace after Maduro said he did not like their questions, Ramos told reporters after arriving back at his Caracas hotel which was surrounded by armed intelligence agents.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s socialist government has long had a tense relationship with Western media, which it largely considers hostile and in league with \u201cimperialist\u201d interests.\n\nShort detentions and deportations have become common, especially as reporters facing delays for official permissions seek shortcuts to report in Venezuela.\n\nThat has come into the spotlight over the past month as Maduro faces his biggest political challenge since he replaced Hugo Chavez six years ago, with dozens of countries recognizing his rival Juan Guaido as the country\u2019s legitimate leader.\n\nAt least seven foreign journalists who flew in to cover the turmoil were briefly detained in January.\n\nRamos, a veteran anchor born in Mexico, said he asked Maduro about the lack of democracy in Venezuela, the torture of political prisoners and the country\u2019s humanitarian crisis.\n\nThe president stopped the interview after being shown a video of young Venezuelans eating from a garbage truck.\n\n\u201cThey confiscated all our equipment,\u201d Ramos told Univision in an interview. \u201cThey have the interview\u201d.\n\nRamos said authorities had informed his team they would be deported on Tuesday and had to be at the airport at 0800 local (0700 ET). He said they were scheduled to leave on a midday flight to Miami.\n\nInformation Minister Jorge Rodriguez said on Twitter the government had in the past welcomed hundreds of journalists to the Miraflores presidential palace, but it did not support \u201ccheap shows\u201d put on with the help of the U.S. Department of State.\n\nMaduro had been conducting interviews with several U.S. media networks on Monday.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s government accuses the United States, which is openly pushing for Maduro to step down, of attempting to orchestrate a coup. Washington earlier on Monday targeted Venezuela with new sanctions and called on allies to freeze assets of its state-owned oil company PDVSA.\n\nThe moves came after Venezuelan security forces violently drove back opposition attempts at the weekend to bring humanitarian aid, including U.S. supplies, into the country against the will of Maduro.\n\nMaduro denies there is a humanitarian crisis despite overseeing a hyperinflationary economic meltdown that has spawned widespread food and medicine shortages and prompted the exodus of around 10 percent of the population.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nSpanish-language Univision and the U.S. Department of State had called on Maduro to release the journalists after Ramos rang the network to say they had been detained.\n\n\u201cNews of their detention and confiscation of their equipment by Maduro\u2019s henchmen are the latest reminder that press freedom in Venezuela applies only to those who are willing to spread the regime\u2019s lies,\u201d tweeted Kimberly Breier, assistant secretary of state for western hemisphere.\n\nMexico\u2019s Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard also tweeted his government\u2019s protest at the events.",

Miraflores Palace/Handout via REUTERS\n\nBut a source familiar with the matter said the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, of which Venezuela is a founding member, had declined to make any formal statement. OPEC says it is concerned with oil policy, not politics.\n\nMore than 40 nations including the United States, European powers and most of Latin America have recognized Maduro\u2019s rival, Juan Guaido, as the country\u2019s rightful head of state, following disputed elections last year.\n\nThe request was made in a letter sent to OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo dated Jan. 29 and seen by Reuters, a day after the United States imposed sanctions on Venezuelan state oil firm PDVSA.\n\n\u201cOur country hopes to receive the solidarity and full support of the member countries of OPEC and its ministerial Conference, in the fight we are currently having against the illegal and arbitrary intrusion of the United States in the internal affairs of Venezuela,\u201d Maduro wrote.\n\nI seek \u201cyour firm support and collaboration to jointly denounce and face this shameless dispossession of ... important assets of one of the members of OPEC\u201d, the letter said.\n\nHe wrote that OPEC should help to determine potential solutions based on \u201cthe impact that this action has on the global energy market, and the risk it represents for the other countries ... of this organization\u201d.\n\nThe sanctions on Venezuela have boosted global oil prices, which were trading at around $62 a barrel on Monday. The move has disrupted shipments as more than 20 tankers loaded with Venezuelan oil have been anchored off the U.S. Gulf Coast.\n\nStill, analysts say there is ample spare capacity in other oil producers such as Saudi Arabia plus strategic reserves in consuming nations to compensate for a loss of Venezuela\u2019s exports.\n\nOPEC tends to avoid political disputes involving individual members. Last year, it declined a request from Iran for a discussion of U.S. sanctions against Tehran at a policy-setting meeting.\n\nVenezuela was once a top-three OPEC oil producer but production has been in decline for years following the collapse of the country\u2019s economy.\n\nEnergy research and consulting firm Rystad sees Venezuelan production plummeting to 680,000 barrels per day (bpd) next year, from 1.34 million bpd at the end of 2018. Venezuela pumped 3 million bpd at the turn of the century.\n\nTogether with Libya and Iran, Venezuela is exempt from the latest OPEC-led supply cut due to the involuntary decline in production.",

REUTERS/Marco Bello\n\nThe arrival of the aid convoy, which includes supplies provided by the United States, has increased the pressure on Maduro hours after a European Union-backed group called for dialogue and elections and warned against interventionism.\n\nMaduro has rejected the aid convoy as a \u201cpolitical show\u201d and vowed to remain in office despite dozens of nations around the world disavowing his leadership and recognizing opposition leader Juan Guaido as the country\u2019s rightful head of state.\n\nEscorted by police motorcycles, the trucks pulled into Cucuta, where Venezuelans were waiting to see whether Maduro\u2019s government would clear the border road he has blocked and allow the humanitarian shipments to pass.\n\nThe crowd waved signs denouncing Maduro as a \u201ccancer\u201d and celebrated the arrival of the convoy.\n\n\u201cThis gives me such hope, especially for the family that I left behind, my children, my wife,\u201d said Israel Escobar, 42, a Venezuelan who came to Cucuta a year ago to sell ice-cream on the streets. \u201cThis is one more step towards ending that terrible regime.\u201d\n\nAcross the border on the Venezuelan side, a group of around 60 protesters demanded that the aid be let through.\n\nMaduro has overseen an economic collapse that has left millions struggling to eat and fueled an unprecedented migration crisis in the region.\n\nAn estimated 3 million Venezuelans have left the oil-rich OPEC country since 2015, some 800,000 of whom have ended up in Colombia.\n\nBut Maduro showed little sign of relenting on aid, as a bridge linking Colombia and Venezuela remained blocked with a cistern and two shipping containers.\n\n\u201cThe so-called \u2018humanitarian aid\u2019 operation is a show, a cheap show, a bad show,\u201d Maduro said in interview with Mexican newspaper La Jornada published on Thursday. \u201cYou can be sure that it won\u2019t disturb Venezuela.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, he appeared in an event at the presidential palace as part of a campaign by government supporters demanding an end to U.S. aggression against Venezuela.\n\nElliott Abrams, Washington\u2019s special envoy on Venezuela, said the aid effort was being coordinated with Guaido\u2019s team but that the aid would not be forced into Venezuela.\n\nRelated Coverage Total says accounts blocked, evacuating staff from Venezuela\n\n\u201cLet it in, that\u2019s what we\u2019re asking, let it in,\u201d Abrams told reporters at a State Department briefing, calling on members of Venezuela\u2019s armed forces to persuade Maduro to step down or to disobey his orders.\n\nHe said the supplies would be delivered to Venezuelans when it was \u201clogistically safe\u201d to do so.\n\nDIALOGUE AND ELECTIONS\n\nWashington last week implemented crippling sanctions on Venezuelan state-owned oil firm PDVSA, which are expected to exacerbate the hyperinflationary economic crisis.\n\nOffering a counter-point to Washington\u2019s hard-line stance, the EU and a group of Latin American governments that have kept a moderate line on Venezuela called for dialogue and fresh elections.\n\nThe EU-backed International Contact Group on Venezuela in its inaugural meeting in the Uruguayan capital of Montevideo said overly forceful intervention could aggravate the crisis.\n\nEU Foreign Policy chief Federica Mogherini said a resolution ultimately must come from the people of Venezuela.\n\n\u201cThis is not only the most desirable result but is the only result if we want to avoid more suffering and a chaotic process,\u201d Mogherini said.\n\nMaduro via Twitter welcomed the call for dialogue.\n\nCritics have said three previous dialogue processes have allowed the ruling Socialist Party to stall for time without making major concessions on key issues including imprisoned opposition politicians and electoral transparency.\n\nGuaido has galvanized the opposition since taking over as head of Venezuela\u2019s National Assembly in January. Last month, he declared himself interim president, opening the door for Washington and others to recognize him as the legitimate leader.\n\nMaduro, who calls Guaido a U.S. puppet seeking to foment a coup, has maintained power with the backing of Venezuela\u2019s military.\n\nOne Venezuelan Air Force general and several Venezuelan diplomats abroad have turned on Maduro and recognized Guaido.\n\nSlideshow (13 Images)\n\nThe websites of Venezuelan embassies in Brazil, Argentina and Mexico on Thursday posted statements recognizing Guaido, which the embassies quickly dismissed as the work of hackers, reiterating \u201cabsolute support\u201d for Maduro.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund, which a new government in Caracas would likely call on for financial assistance, is awaiting guidance from its member countries on whether to recognize Guaido, IMF spokesman Gerry Rice said on Thursday.",

REUTERS/Marco Bello\n\nGuaido last month invoked constitutional provisions to assume an interim presidency, arguing Maduro\u2019s re-election was fraudulent. He has since been recognized by most Western nations - including Brazil - as Venezuela\u2019s rightful leader.\n\nThe congress chief has organized nationwide protests over the past month while the United States has imposed crippling sanctions on Venezuela\u2019s key oil industry and government officials. Yet Maduro retains control of state institutions, leaving the two sides locked in a stalemate.\n\nGuaido will travel to Brasilia for a two-day visit from Bogota, where he attended a meeting with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence and the regional Lima group about how to resolve the political and economic crisis in Venezuela.\n\n\u201cThe interim president of Venezuela will meet on Thursday afternoon with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro at the Planalto Palace,\u201d said Maria Teresa Belandria, appointed by Guaido as his ambassador to Brazil and recognized as such by the far-right Bolsonaro government.\n\nAfter the meeting on 2 p.m. (1700 GMT) on Thursday, Guaido will hold a news conference, the envoy said.\n\nGuaido over the weekend called for the international community to make clear all options were on the table to oust Maduro, after security forces loyal to him violently drove back the opposition\u2019s attempts to bring humanitarian aid into the country.\n\nBrazil, whose northern state of Roraima depends on Venezuela for electrical power, this week played down the possibility of military intervention.\n\nWhile in the Brazilian capital, Guaido will also meet with diplomats of other countries that have recognized him as Venezuela\u2019s interim leader, pending new presidential elections, Belandria said.\n\nOPTIONS ON THE TABLE\n\nBrazil is hosting one of the Venezuelan opposition\u2019s collection points for aid and together with the United States has funded the 200 tonnes of food and medicine being stockpiled in the northern city of Boa Vista.\n\nThe opposition failed to get that aid across the border as planned last weekend after Maduro closed it, and 25 Venezuelans who were wounded by gunfire in protests across the frontier were treated in a Brazilian hospital.\n\nRoraima state said on Wednesday a Venezuelan man who had suffered a gunshot wound died of multiple organ failure. That raised the death toll from protests on Friday and Saturday to five, Venezuelan rights group Penal Forum said.\n\nMaduro denies there is a crisis in Venezuela despite overseeing a hyperinflationary meltdown that has resulted in sharp increases in malnutrition and the spread of preventable disease, as well as an exodus of 3.4 million Venezuelans since 2015.\n\nThe socialist leader and his allies, like Russia and Cuba, have accused the opposition of using aid as an excuse for foreign intervention, and the United States of preparing for a military incursion.\n\nThe U.S. special envoy for Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, denied those accusations on Tuesday but said Washington would impose more sanctions on \u201chigh-ranking members of the regime and their financial affairs\u201d this week and next.\n\nIn the latest sign of Maduro\u2019s desperation to raise hard currency amid tightening sanctions, at least 8 tons of gold were removed from the Venezuelan central bank\u2019s vaults last week, an opposition legislator and three government sources told Reuters.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s foreign minister on Wednesday suggested talks between Maduro and U.S. President Donald Trump over the crisis - an idea the Trump administration immediately rejected.\n\nJorge Arreaza, addressing the U.N. Human Rights Council, suggested that Maduro and Trump meet to \u201ctry to find common ground and explain their differences.\u201d He also said his country had lost $30 billion in assets \u201cconfiscated\u201d since November 2017 under sanctions.\n\nU.S. Vice President Mike Pence ruled out the idea of talks. \u201cThe only thing to discuss with Maduro at this point is the time and date for his departure,\u201d he said on Twitter.\n\n\u201cFor democracy to return and for Venezuela to rebuild - Maduro must go,\u201d Pence said.",

Late on Friday the government shuttered the Tachira frontier that connects with Cucuta.\n\nSome political analysts say the looming showdown is less about solving Venezuela\u2019s needs and more about testing the military\u2019s loyalty to Maduro by daring it to turn the aid away.\n\nWith inflation running at more than 2 million percent a year and currency controls restricting imports of basic goods, a growing share of the country\u2019s roughly 30 million people is suffering from malnutrition.\n\nGuaido showed up late on Friday at a fundraising concert in Cucuta backed by British billionaire Richard Branson that was estimated to have attracted nearly 200,000 people.\n\nHis appearance, arm-in-arm with Colombian President Ivan Duque, was an open challenge to Maduro given that the pro-government Supreme Court has banned him from international travel on grounds he is under investigation for allegedly helping foreign countries to interfere in internal matters.\n\nSOLDIERS OPENED FIRE\n\nFriday\u2019s violence broke out in the village of Kumarakapay in southern Venezuela after an indigenous community stopped a military convoy heading toward the border with Brazil that they believed was attempting to block aid, according to community leaders Richard Fernandez and Ricardo Delgado.\n\nSoldiers later entered the village and opened fire, killing a couple and injuring several others, they said.

REUTERS/Jorge Silva REUTERS/File Photo\n\nAmid a hyperinflationary economic collapse that has caused malnutrition and the exodus of millions of people, humanitarian aid has become a flashpoint in an intensifying political crisis.\n\nOpposition leader Juan Guaido said last week a global coalition that includes the United States was sending food and medicine to collection points in Colombia, Brazil and an undisclosed Caribbean island before delivering the aid into Venezuela.\n\nBrazil has joined the United states as well as most countries in Latin America and Europe in recognizing Guaido as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate interim leader, arguing that Maduro was re-elected in a fraudulent May 2018 vote.\n\nBut Maduro denies there is even a crisis, saying it is part of a U.S.-directed plot to undermine and overthrow his government.\n\nSix leaders of the Pemon community residing in the \u201cGran Sabana\u201d (or \u201cGreat Savannah\u201d) municipality bordering Brazil told Reuters that the population\u2019s pressing needs should trump any politicization of humanitarian aid.\n\nThe Gran Sabana, a grassy plain dotted with immense tabletop mountains in the southern state of Bolivar, is home to the only paved border crossing between Venezuela and Brazil.\n\n\u201cWe are physically prepared - without weapons - and willing to open the border to receive the humanitarian aid,\u201d Gran Sabana Mayor Emilio Gonzalez told Reuters. \u201cNeither the National Guard not the government can stop this.\u201d\n\nIndigenous communities boast a greater degree of autonomy than others in Venezuela.\n\nThe Bolivar governor and military chief for the region of Guayana, which comprises the states of Bolivar and Amazonas, were not immediately available for comment.\n\nOUTSIDERS EYED WARILY\n\n\u201cWe are the natives of Gran Sabana and we will not allow some generals from outside to decide for us,\u201d said Jorge Perez, the region\u2019s councilman for indigenous communities. \u201cWe are the legitimate authorities.\u201d\n\nPerez said he conducts daily visits to the local hospital where patients and doctors alike despaired over the lack of medicine.\n\n\u201cFor any emergency, they are taking us to Brazil - it\u2019s embarrassing; the hospital of Boa Vista is full of Venezuelan patients,\u201d he said.\n\nBoa Vista, the capital of the Brazilian border state of Roraima, has received tens of thousands of Venezuelans fleeing turmoil in recent years.\n\nMount Roraima, standing at over 2,800-meters (9,200-feet) high and straddling the border, is sacred ground for the Pemons and a spiritual symbol for many Venezuelans.\n\nMayor Gonzalez said authorities in Brazil had not yet informed him of a precise date for the arrival of aid at the border.\n\nA Brazilian government spokeswoman declined to comment on the issue of aid, but confirmed ground transportation into Gran Sabana was possible.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s opposition has so far only publicly announced the arrival of aid in the Colombian border town of Cucuta, where it is now being stockpiled as Venezuelan authorities have made it clear they will not allow it to enter the country.\n\nREADY FOR BATTLE?\n\nPemon leaders said they had already demonstrated their willingness to confront the Venezuelan military over aid after troops with metal barriers blocked the road between the town of Santa Elena de Uairen and the Brazilian border.\n\nThe Pemon community, which numbers more than 10,000 in Venezuela, has a history of skirmishes with the military over issues ranging from gasoline cuts to informal mining.\n\nThe military was trying to capture a colonel, they said, who had disavowed Maduro and was trying to help coordinate the arrival of aid, adding that he managed to cross the border into Brazil.\n\nFILE PHOTO: People bathe on the Tec river as they are on the road to Mount Roraima, near Venezuela's border with Brazil, Jan. 13, 2015.

He also reiterated his government\u2019s support for a peaceful solution to the Venezuelan crisis.\n\nVenezuela, a major oil producer, is in the throes of a severe economic crisis with a dramatic drop in output and six-digit inflation wreaking havoc on the livelihoods of residents, sending an estimated 3 million of them seeking refuge in neighboring countries.\n\nCommunist-run Cuba has been a key backer of the Venezuelan government since the Bolivarian Revolution that began under former leader Hugo Chavez in 1998.\n\nMost Western and Latin American countries, including the United States, quickly recognized Guaido as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate head of state and pledged millions of dollars in humanitarian aid in support. The aid has begun arriving along the border with Colombia and Brazil.\n\nMaduro\u2019s socialist government retains the backing of Russia, China and many other nations, as well as control of state institutions including the military.\n\nGuaido said on Tuesday the aid would roll across the border on Feb. 23 despite the Maduro government\u2019s objections, setting up a possible confrontation.\n\nCuba said on Thursday it was clear the United States wanted to \u201cforcibly establish a humanitarian corridor under international protection, invoking the obligation to protect civilians and applying all necessary measures.\u201d",

    "title": "How Venezuela turns its useless bank notes into gold",
    "description": "EL CALLAO, Venezuela (REUTERS) - Venezuela's most successful financial operations in recent years have not taken place on Wall Street, but in primitive gold-mining camps in the nation's southern reaches.",
    "text": "(This February 10 story corrects to remove reference to Istanbul Gold Refinery (IGR))\n\nBy Corina Pons and Maria Ramirez\n\nEL CALLAO, Venezuela (Reuters) - Venezuela\u2019s most successful financial operations in recent years have not taken place on Wall Street, but in primitive gold-mining camps in the nation\u2019s southern reaches.\n\nWith the country\u2019s economy in meltdown, an estimated 300,000 fortune hunters have descended on this mineral-rich jungle area to earn a living pulling gold-flecked earth from makeshift mines.\n\nTheir picks and shovels are helping to prop up the leftist government of President Nicolas Maduro. Since 2016, his administration has purchased 17 tonnes of the metal worth around $650 million from so-called artisan miners, according to the most recent data from the nation\u2019s central bank.\n\nPaid with the country\u2019s near-worthless bank notes, these amateurs in turn supply the government with hard currency to purchase badly needed imports of food and hygiene products. This gold trade is a blip on international markets. Still, the United States is using sanctions and intimidation in an effort to stop Maduro from using his nation\u2019s gold to stay afloat.\n\nThe Trump administration is pressuring the United Kingdom not to release $1.2 billion in gold reserves Venezuela has stored in the Bank of England. U.S. officials recently castigated an Abu Dhabi-based investment firm for its Venezuela gold purchases, and have warned other potential foreign buyers to back off.\n\nThe existence of Maduro\u2019s gold program is well-known. How it functions is not.\n\nTo get a glimpse inside, Reuters tracked Venezuela\u2019s gold from steamy jungle mines, through the central bank in the capital of Caracas to gold refineries and food exporters abroad, speaking with more than 30 people with knowledge of the trade. They included miners, intermediaries, merchants, academic researchers, diplomats and government officials. Almost all requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, or because they feared retribution from Venezuelan or U.S. authorities.\n\nWhat emerges is the portrait of a desperate experiment in laissez-faire industrial policy by Venezuela\u2019s socialist leaders. U.S. sanctions have hammered the nation\u2019s oil industry and crippled its ability to borrow. The formal mining sector has been decimated by nationalization. So Maduro has unleashed freelance prospectors to extract the nation\u2019s mineral wealth with virtually no regulation or state investment.\n\nThe Bolivarian Revolution now leans heavily on ragtag laborers such as Jose Aular, a teenager who says he has contracted malaria five times at a wildcat mine near Venezuela\u2019s border with Brazil. Aular works 12 hours daily lugging sacks of earth to a small mill that uses toxic mercury to extract flecks of precious metal. Mining accidents are common in these ramshackle operations, workers said. So are shootings and robberies.\n\n\u201cThe government knows what happens in these mines and it benefits from it,\u201d said Aular, 18. \u201cOur gold goes into their hands.\u201d\n\nMaduro has also received a crucial assist from Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, a fellow strongman who has likewise sparred with the Trump administration.\n\nVenezuela exports part of its gold to Turkey, then uses some of the proceeds to buy that nation\u2019s consumer goods, according to opposition legislator Carlos Paparoni. Turkish pasta and powdered milk are now staples in Maduro\u2019s subsidized food program. Trade between the two nations grew eightfold last year.\n\nBut scrutiny is intensifying as Venezuela\u2019s politics reach the boiling point. In recent days, many Western countries have recognized Venezuela\u2019s opposition leader Juan Guaido as the South American nation\u2019s rightful president.\n\nMaduro\u2019s adversaries have called on foreign buyers of Venezuela\u2019s precious metal to stop doing business with what they say is an illegitimate regime.\n\n\u201cWe are going to protect our gold,\u201d opposition legislator Carlos Paparoni told Reuters in an interview.\n\nGOLD FEVER\n\nThe gold road begins in places like La Culebra, an isolated jungle area in southern Venezuela. Here, hundreds of men labor in crude mining operations that would be at home in the 19th century. They excavate mineral-laden dirt with picks in hand-dug tunnels, hauling it out with pulleys and winches.\n\nTheir activity is laying waste to fragile forest ecosystems and spreading mosquito-borne diseases. Miners complain of shakedowns by military forces sent to guard the region, whose homicide rate is seven times the national average. Venezuela\u2019s ministries of defense and information did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nA man melts gold at his workshop in Puerto Ordaz, Venezuela August 7, 2018. REUTERS/William Urdaneta\n\nMiner Jose Rondon is used to hardship. Now 47, he arrived in 2016 from northeast Venezuela with his two adult sons. His bus driver\u2019s salary could not keep pace with Venezuela\u2019s hyperinflation, which the International Monetary Fund projects will hit 10 million percent this year.\n\nThe three men net roughly 10 grams of gold monthly from backbreaking work. Still it is roughly 20 times what they could earn back home.\n\n\u201cHere I do much better,\u201d said Rondon, resting in a crude bunkhouse strung with hammocks.\n\nGold in hand, miners head to the town of El Callao to sell their nuggets. Most buyers are unlicensed, small-scale traders working in cramped shops fitted with alarms and steel doors.\n\n\u201cThe state is buying gold, everyone is buying gold, because it\u2019s what is doing well,\u201d said Jhony Diaz, a licensed wholesaler in Puerto Ordaz, 171 kilometers (106 miles) north of El Callao. Diaz says he buys gold from traders and resells every three days to the central bank.\n\nBecause Venezuela\u2019s currency, the bolivar, is worth less every hour someone holds it, the state pays a premium over international prices to make it worthwhile for those who could smuggle gold out of the country to exchange for dollars.\n\nTraders who sell to Diaz end up with bricks of cash to carry back to El Callao and other gold-rush towns to pay miners, who use it to buy food, supplies and send whatever is left to their families.\n\nGold purchased by the government is smelted in the nearby furnaces of Minerven, the state-run mining company, according to a high-ranking employee. It is then transported to the vaults of the central bank in the capital Caracas, 843 kilometers (524 miles) away.\n\nThe gold does not stay there long. The central bank\u2019s gold reserves have plummeted to their lowest levels in 75 years as it sells the gold to pay its bills. One of the main buyers of this gold is Turkey, Paparoni said.\n\nTURKISH ALLIANCE\n\nMaduro\u2019s gold program has developed in tandem with his deepening relationship with Turkey\u2019s Erdogan. Both leaders have been criticized internationally for cracking down on political dissent and undermining democratic norms to concentrate power.\n\nA Nov. 1 executive order signed by U.S. President Donald Trump bars U.S. persons and entities from buying gold from Venezuela. It does not apply to foreigners. Ankara has assured the U.S. Treasury that all of Turkey\u2019s trade with Venezuela is in accordance with international law.\n\nVenezuela in December 2016 announced a direct flight from Caracas to Istanbul on Turkish Airlines. The development was surprising given low demand for travel between the two nations.\n\nTrade data show those planes are carrying more than passengers. On New Year\u2019s Day, 2018, Venezuela\u2019s central bank began shipping gold to Turkey with a $36 million air shipment of the metal to Istanbul. It came just weeks after a visit by Maduro to Turkey.\n\nShipments last year reached $900 million, according to Turkish government data and trade reports.\n\nSocialist Party leader Tareck El Aissami during a visit to Turkey in January said Venezuela was boosting gold sales to Turkey while seeking to increase the supply of Turkish food products to Venezuela, state-owned Turkish Anadolu news agency reported.\n\nTurkish consumer products, meanwhile, are making their way to Venezuelan tables. In early December, 54 containers of Turkish powdered milk arrived at the port of La Guaira near Caracas, according to port records seen by Reuters.\n\nThe Istanbul-based shipper, Mulberry Proje Yatirim, shares an address with Marilyns Proje Yatirim, a mining company that signed a joint venture with Venezuela\u2019s state mining firm Minerven last year, according to filings with a Turkish trade registry gazette in September.\n\nThe companies did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nEven Maduro\u2019s critics acknowledge he has pulled off a neat trick of alchemy: By compensating hard-pressed citizen miners with inflation-ravaged bolivars and obtaining precious metal in return, he has found a way to spin straw into gold.\n\nSlideshow (13 Images)\n\nVenezuelan economist Angel Alvarado, an opposition lawmaker, said \u201cdark operations and unusual mechanisms of commercial exchange,\u201d are among the few tools Maduro has left.\n\n\u201cThere is a desperation to stay in power at all costs,\u201d Alvarado said.",

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts/File Photo\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican and Democratic U.S. senators proposed legislation on Thursday that would let an estimated 72,000 Venezuelans remain in the United States after fleeing chaos in their country.\n\nRepublican Marco Rubio and Democrat Bob Menendez introduced the legislation along with Democrats Dick Durbin, Patrick Leahy and Cory Booker. It would immediately grant \u201cTemporary Protected Status\u201d to allow Venezuelans who passed security checks to remain in the United States for 18 months.\n\nThere was no immediate indication of whether the Senate\u2019s Republican leaders would allow the measure to come up for a vote. The bill\u2019s backers hope that continued uncertainty in Venezuela and President Donald Trump\u2019s support for the opposition movement seeking to oust socialist President Nicolas Maduro will ease any resistance.\n\nTrump has generally been an immigration skeptic, and his administration has pushed to end TPS status for other immigrant groups, including Salvadorans, Hondurans and Haitians.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe International Rescue Committee, which urged the Trump administration to provide the TPS designation for Venezuelans earlier this week, has estimated that there are 72,000 Venezuelans currently in the United States who would be allowed to remain and work under the program.\n\nThe humanitarian nongovernmental organization has said that more than 3.4 million Venezuelans have left their country since 2015 as its economic crisis has deepened, and estimated that more than 5 million will be displaced by this time next year.\n\nSimilar legislation has been introduced in the House of Representatives by Republican Mario Diaz-Balart and Democrat Darren Soto.",

    "description": "Local opposition leader Jose Rengel has spent almost five weeks in a cramped detention cell on the outskirts of the Venezuelan capital Caracas, after a single witness accused him of leading a riot that burned down a public building.",
    "text": "EL JUNQUITO, Venezuela (Reuters) - Local opposition leader Jose Rengel has spent almost five weeks in a cramped detention cell on the outskirts of the Venezuelan capital Caracas, after a single witness accused him of leading a riot that burned down a public building.\n\nRengel was arrested together with eight other men on January 24 after the witness - a member of the ruling Socialist Party - told soldiers that the 59-year-old had sacked shops and \u201ccompletely destroyed\u201d a public transport office using Molotov cocktails, according to a National Guard report filed one day later.\n\nThe detained men, who are described by their families as opposition sympathizers, now face charges of arson, theft, and illegally carrying weapons, which could lead to 10-year jail sentences. The men all deny taking part in the protest, according to statements they gave to a court and their lawyers.\n\nA visit to the neighborhood of El Junquito, a string of poor settlements atop a ridgeline west of the teeming Venezuelan capital, shows the public transport building still stands. The one-room office, its interior decorated with a portrait of former president Hugo Chavez, is providing services as normal and shows no sign of significant damage.\n\nThe National Guard said in its report that they found no weapons on Rengel. They said they seized two shotguns from two other men, both of whom, via their lawyers, denied having them. In addition, the men\u2019s families and neighbors said none of the men were near the transport office at the time of their arrest, contradicting the National Guard\u2019s report that they were detained during the demonstration just after 7 p.m.\n\nThe men all remain in custody.\n\nThe witness, Jesus Vielma, told Reuters he stood by his testimony and said the men were \u201ca band of criminals.\u201d The lieutenant who wrote the report, Jorge Acevedo, did not respond to Facebook messages and the National Guard did not respond to requests to comment on his behalf. Rengel\u2019s lawyers said he denied all charges.\n\nThe arrest of the nine men here in El Junquito is part of what some civil rights groups estimate at almost 1,100 arrests by President Nicolas Maduro\u2019s government since opposition leader Juan Guaido invoked the constitution and assumed a rival presidency on January 23, with the backing of the United States.\n\nThe government has denied it takes political prisoners or fabricates evidence, and says the crackdown is aimed at clearing out criminals.\n\nInterviews by Reuters with 20 people in El Junquito, a dozen of whom said they were with the men at the time, plus a review of court records and a National Guard report, contradict the National Guard\u2019s official account that they arrested the men during a violent protest.\n\nTheir families and lawyers told Reuters they believe the men were arbitrarily detained, based on the lack of evidence to support the charges against them.\n\nSome 120 locals have signed a written petition backing the family\u2019s version of the events.\n\nThe National Guard did not respond to requests to comment about the discrepancies between its report and the witnesses interviewed. The Information Ministry, which handles all media enquiries for the government, did not respond either.\n\nRelated Coverage Colombia calls at U.N. for action on Venezuela crisis\n\nWith Maduro under mounting pressure, the arrests, along with some 40 extrajudicial killings by security forces, have spread fear through poor areas, limiting further demonstrations, local politicians and NGOs say.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re now going after the little guy,\u201d said Javier Torres, a colleague of Rengel, who is head of the opposition Democratic Action party in El Junquito. \u201cIt\u2019s to try to silence the voices of leaders in communities that have protested.\u201d\n\nFor a map of where the men say they were arrested, click: tmsnrt.rs/2U3Hmbm\n\nA KNOCK ON THE DOOR\n\nRengel\u2019s wife said he was preparing dinner for the family when several dozen masked soldiers arrived at the house on motorbikes at 9:30 p.m.\n\n\u201cWhen they knocked, my husband opened the door without realizing what he would find,\u201d said his wife, Onoris de Rengel, 59. \u201cThe soldiers entered shouting \u2018Who is Jose Rengel? Who is Jose Rengel?\u2019 They went to the kitchen and ordered us to the ground. They asked him where were the weapons.\u201d\n\nThe soldiers left with Rengel, who they beat hard enough to bruise his ribs, the family and their lawyer said. Photos of the family home, taken by neighbors and seen by Reuters, appear to show it ransacked after a raid, with furniture overturned and clothes strewn across the floor.\n\nVenezuelan legal aid group Penal Forum, which is representing other people detained in the area, said the arrests come amid a political crackdown since dozens of countries recognized Guaido as the legitimate head-of-state. Maduro accuses Guaido of leading a U.S.-orchestrated coup to oust him.\n\nPenal Forum says the 1,069 politically motivated arrests between January 21 and January 31 are the most since it began keeping records almost 18 years ago. Most cases involve planted evidence and invented circumstances to justify detentions, its director, Alfredo Romero, said.\n\nThe government began another crackdown on Saturday when troops at the border blocked humanitarian aid convoys sent by the opposition from Colombia and Brazil. Penal Forum says it has recorded over 60 arrests over the weekend.\n\nThe Information Ministry did not respond to requests to comment about Penal Forum\u2019s accusations. The Supreme Court\u2019s president, Maikel Moreno, said in January that judicial officials carry out \u201cinvaluable work with professionalism, ethics and quality.\u201d\n\n\u201cSCOURGES OF THE AREA\u201d\n\nLocals in El Junquito said there was a small opposition protest on the evening of January 24, when a few dozen people blocked the main road and burned tires close to the Cacique Tiuna transport office.\n\nEugenia Vicuna holds a cushion made from the t-shirt that, she says, her son was wearing at the moment of his detention at their house in El Junquito, Venezuela, February 7, 2019. Picture taken February 7, 2019. To match Insight VENEZUELA-POLITICS/EVIDENCE. REUTERS/Angus Berwick\n\nAt about 7 p.m., Jorge Acevedo, the young National Guard lieutenant, received a call at his outpost, some 4 km (2.5 miles) away, according to his report.\n\nThe caller, Jesus Vielma, head of a local council for the ruling Socialist Party, told Acevedo that Rengel was leading a riot, the report shows. The National Guard withheld Vielma\u2019s identity in the report, but he confirmed to Reuters he was the witness.\n\nAcevedo said when he and other soldiers reached the scene, protesters attacked them with petrol bombs and rocks. Acevedo wrote that they arrested Rengel and eight others after cornering them, describing them as \u201cthe most violent ones there.\u201d\n\nAn employee at the transport office said she was still there that evening at 7 p.m. and protesters only began throwing projectiles an hour later. She said protesters stole several desks and a petrol bomb was thrown against the building, forcing them to re-paint the walls.\n\nIn a statement given at the National Guard outpost that evening, Vielma said that he saw Rengel carrying a shotgun and identified the detained men as those who sacked the office: \u201cThey are the scourges of the area.\u201d\n\nVielma, in an interview with Reuters, praised the National Guard for bringing order to the community. \u201cWe cannot accept a band of criminals. They have to accept the consequences,\u201d he said.\n\nDuring a January 26 hearing at a Caracas court, the prosecutor provided no evidence beyond Vielma\u2019s testimony and the two shotguns he said the National Guard seized, but emphasized the \u201cmagnitude of the damage,\u201d court documents show.\n\nThe judge remanded the men in custody for 45 days while the investigation continues.\n\nCRAMPED CELL\n\nSome families of the men detained in El Junquito say the men were opposition sympathizers.\n\n\u201cThere were some 40 motor-bikes driving up the road. They stopped us, grabbed him and pulled him onto a bike,\u201d said 19-year-old Yosneilis Calzadilla, the girlfriend of one of the detained men, Jhon Mijares. \u201cThey didn\u2019t tell us anything.\u201d\n\nThe nine men are jailed inside a 1 meter by 7 meter cell with dozens more detainees, according to their families, lawyers and court documents.\n\nEugenia de Vicuna said she has only been able to see her son, Enmanuel, twice, for six minutes in total, since soldiers shot the 21-year-old student at point-blank range with rubber rounds while he was returning home from shopping that evening.\n\nThe rounds left 20 open wounds on his back which have still not been treated, according to his family and a photo supplied by his lawyer.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nOn January 29, a judge, in a written ruling, ordered the National Guard to transfer Vicuna and the other eight men to a hospital. But his family and relatives and lawyers for the other men say they remain in the cell.\n\nThe National Guard and Information Ministry did not respond to requests to comment on why they remain there.",

    "text": "Spain has warned that it will not back any military intervention in Venezuela after the South American country\u2019s opposition leader, Juan Guaid\u00f3, urged other nations to consider \u201call options\u201d to remove the president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, from power.\n\nGuaid\u00f3 is due to meet the US vice-president, Mike Pence, in Colombia on Monday amid ongoing speculation that the Trump administration could use force to oust Maduro.\n\nVenezuela: Guaid\u00f3 wants 'all options' open as he meets Pence Read more\n\nGuaid\u00f3\u2019s appeal came after a day of violence on Saturday, as opposition supporters spent hours trying to break a government blockade and carry food and medical supplies into Venezuela. At least four people were killed and more than 300 hundred injured.\n\n\u201cThe events of today oblige me to take a decision,\u201d Guaid\u00f3 said on Twitter on Sunday, \u201cto formally propose to the international community that we should keep all options open to achieve the liberation of our homeland\u201d.\n\nPence will announce \u201cconcrete steps\u201d and \u201cclear actions\u201d at a summit of the regional Lima Group in Bogot\u00e1 on Monday, a senior US official told reporters on Sunday.\n\n\u201cWhat happened yesterday is not going to deter us from getting humanitarian aid into Venezuela,\u201d the official said.\n\nHowever, the Spanish government spoke out pointedly against any use of foreign force.\n\n\u201cNot every option is on the table,\u201d the country\u2019s foreign minister, Josep Borrell, told the Spanish news agency Efe on Sunday. \u201cWe have clearly warned that we would not support \u2013 and would roundly condemn \u2013 any foreign military intervention, which is something we hope won\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nBorrell repeated calls for fresh elections in the South American country, adding: \u201cThe solution in Venezuela can only be reached through a democratic solution agreed by Venezuelans and the calling of presidential elections.\u201d\n\nSpain\u2019s prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, was among the European leaders who recognised Guaid\u00f3 at the beginning of February. S\u00e1nchez said there were deep ties that bound Spain to Latin America and promised to work to help \u201cbring freedom, prosperity and harmony to all Venezuelans\u201d.\n\nThe decision to recognise Guaid\u00f3 prompted Maduro to lash out at the former colonial power and accuse S\u00e1nchez of being a coward and a US stooge.\n\nRelations between the two countries have long been fraught. In 2007, King Juan Carlos famously objected to the behaviour of the then Venezuelan president, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, at a summit, telling him: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you shut up?\u201d.\n\nIn January last year, Maduro\u2019s government expelled the Spanish ambassador to Venezuela, leading Madrid to designate the Venezuelan ambassador to Spain persona non grata. The Venezuelan president said Spain was run by an \u201celite, racist colonial oligarchy\u201d and had repeatedly meddled in his country\u2019s affairs. The two countries agreed to normalise their diplomatic relations three months later.\n\nPence will have a one-on-one meeting in Bogot\u00e1 with Guaid\u00f3, whom the US has also recognised as the interim president of Venezuela.\n\nThe 35-year-old, who transformed Venezuelan politics and united a fractured and ineffective opposition when he declared himself the country\u2019s legitimate leader in January, has repeatedly said his focus is on a peaceful transition and new elections.\n\nGuaid\u00f3 claimed on Monday morning that more than 160 soldiers and policemen had fled to Colombia, refusing to continue to follow Maduro\u2019s orders. \u201cVenezuelans recognise the bravery and patriotic spirit of the more than 160 soldiers and policemen who yesterday were on the side of the constitution,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. \u201cMany more will follow their example.\u201d\n\nBut his comments on Saturday raised concerns he might be considering a military intervention and were soon picked up by US hawks including the Florida senator Marco Rubio.\n\n\u201cThe grave crimes committed today by the Maduro regime have opened the door to various potential multilateral actions not on the table just 24 hours ago,\u201d Rubio said in response to Guaid\u00f3, also on Twitter.\n\nOn Sunday morning, he added: \u201cThe willingness of many nations to support stronger multilateral actions to dislodge them has increased dramatically.\u201d\n\nThe US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, was more circumspect, saying \u201cfurther action will be contemplated\u201d at Monday\u2019s meeting, but the focus would be on sanctions, humanitarian aid and actions by Venezuelans themselves.\n\nDonald Trump did not immediately respond to Guaid\u00f3, but he said last month \u201call options were on the table\u201d, and has suggested invading Venezuela.\n\nOn Sunday, a top US official was asked whether the US would provide military assistance were Guaid\u00f3 to request it. \u201cUltimately, it would be a decision for the president to make,\u201d the official said.\n\nDavid Smolansky, opposition leader in exile and close friend and ally of Guaid\u00f3, insisted they were not calling for troops on the ground. \u201cIt is still a peaceful movement,\u201d he said. \u201cViolence yesterday came from armed pro-government gangs and security forces.\u201d\n\nBut pressed on whether he would support military intervention in future, he declined to rule it out, saying: \u201cThe only option we have is to restore democracy and freedom with internal and external pressure.\u201d\n\nThe UN secretary general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, deplored the weekend\u2019s killings, calling for violence to be \u201cavoided at any cost and for lethal force not to be used in any circumstances\u201d. He urged \u201call actors to lower tensions and pursue every effort to prevent further escalation\u201d.\n\nHis comments were echoed by Michelle Bachelet, the head of the UN human rights office.\n\n\u201cPeople have been shot and killed, others have reportedly received wounds from which they will never completely recover, including losing eyes,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are disgraceful scenes. The Venezuelan government must stop its forces from using excessive force against unarmed protesters and ordinary citizens.\u201d",

    "text": "Top Latin America adviser claims \u2018there is not a single scenario\u2019 in which Maduro and his \u2018cronies\u2019 are able to retain power\n\nDonald Trump\u2019s top Latin America adviser has claimed \u201cthere is not a single scenario\u201d in which Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his \u201ccronies\u201d are able to retain power in Venezuela.\n\nThe revolt against Maduro\u2019s regime is entering its fourth week, with the Venezuelan strongman showing no sign of relinquishing power despite a startling and largely unforeseen challenge from a previously obscure opposition leader called Juan Guaid\u00f3.\n\nAn anticipated large-scale military abandonment of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s heir has not materialized despite Guaid\u00f3 \u2013 who is now recognized as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate interim president by most western governments \u2013 repeatedly touting an amnesty for the armed forces.\n\nHowever, in an interview with Latin American journalists in Washington, the National Security Council\u2019s senior director for western hemisphere affairs insisted Maduro\u2019s demise was a foregone conclusion.\n\n\u201cThe path we are going down is irreversible \u2026 The question is no longer if Maduro accepts this or not, it\u2019s how long it will take him to accept it,\u201d Mauricio Claver-Carone said.\n\nClaver-Carone, a conservative Cuban-American lawyer, renewed US calls for Venezuela\u2019s military top brass to ditch Maduro, claiming the White House would not \u201cpersecute\u201d those who backed \u201ca peaceful and democratic transition\u201d. \u201cWe are not in the business of revenge, nor are we seeking to settle scores.\u201d\n\nMaduro\u2019s domestic and international foes are adamant he is doomed. Colombia\u2019s foreign minister, Carlos Holmes Trujillo, last week branded Maduro\u2019s regime \u201can unburied corpse\u201d.\n\nBut many observers believe Guaid\u00f3\u2019s opposition movement will be frustrated not to have seen more military defections.\n\nWith a new round of opposition protests planned for Tuesday, Venezuela expert Mois\u00e9s Na\u00edm admitted it was impossible to predict Maduro\u2019s fate.\n\n\u201cWe are living in maximum uncertainty. He could be gone tomorrow or he could be around for the next few months,\u201d said Na\u00edm, a fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and former Venezuelan minister.\n\nAnd whatever happens to Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s heir, it is not guaranteed his regime would fall with him, with some believing a rival Chavista could emerge as an internal challenger.\n\n\u201cOne scenario is that Maduro leaves, but the regime stays,\u201d Na\u00edm said, pointing to what he believed was a fierce and long-running behind-the-scenes struggle for control of Chavismo.\n\n\u201cIt is a battle of the socialist billionaires for survival.\u201d\n\nNicmer Evans, a longtime Chavista who split with the movement in 2013, agreed that while Maduro was down, the political movement he inherited after Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s 2013 death was not yet out.\n\n\u201cMaduro might kill [Chavismo] but it\u2019s still not dead. It\u2019s in critical condition. It\u2019s a wounded animal. It\u2019s in power, it can respond, it is capable of harming \u2013 but it is agonizing,\u201d Evans said.\n\nMaduro has been hit hard by sweeping US oil sanctions intended to asphyxiate his regime although Venezuela\u2019s state-run oil giant, PDVSA, is reportedly now asking customers to make payments into a newly opened account in Russia in order to sidestep those prohibitions.\n\nAnother challenge is expected in the coming days with opposition leaders currently stockpiling US humanitarian aid on the Colombian border which they vow to bring into Venezuela.\n\nOn Friday, Maduro insisted the aid convoy would not be allowed in, calling it a \u201ca rotten gift\u201d and an imperialist military provocation designed to destabilize his government.\n\nSpeaking in Caracas on Sunday, Guaid\u00f3 urged the military to ignore Maduro\u2019s \u201cridiculous\u201d order to block the aid. \u201cToday we can save lives in Venezuela,\u201d he told reporters.\n\nGuaid\u00f3 echoed Claver-Carone\u2019s claim that time was running out for Maduro. \u201cEvery day that passes \u2026 is a victory for democracy that brings us closer to the freedom of Venezuela.\u201d",

    "description": "UN security council officials clash over \u2018politicised\u2019 aid to troubled country as peace-building chief warns of \u2018grim realities\u2019 Infant mortality in Venezuela has soared by roughly 50% during the prolonged political crisis in the country. Briefing the UN secu\u2026",
    "text": "Infant mortality in Venezuela has soared by roughly 50% during the prolonged political crisis in the country.\n\nBriefing the UN security council, the UN\u2019s political and peace building chief, Rosemary DiCarlo, depicted a devastating collapse in Venezuela\u2019s health system. She warned that 40% of medical staff had left the country and said hospital stocks of medicine had dwindled to 20% of the required level.\n\nDiCarlo said the \u201cprotracted crisis\u201d in the country had led in recent weeks to an \u201calarming escalation of tensions\u201d. Four people died and hundreds were injured in clashes last weekend at the country\u2019s borders.\n\nSecurity council members clashed over the increasingly politicised humanitarian aid efforts to Venezuela, the government of which, led by Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, is backed by China and Russia, and opposed by the US and a number of European and Latin American countries, who want Maduro to step down.\n\nDiCarlo warned of the \u201cgrim reality\u201d facing a country where citizens are dying of preventable causes and 3.4 million people have fled the worsening conditions.\n\nCommenting on the recent politicisation of aid efforts to Venezuela, DiCarlo said the UN was coordinating efforts to deliver assistance as close as possible to Venezuelans in need. She added that aid delivery should be free \u201cfrom political objectives and delivered on the basis of need\u201d.\n\nDiCarlo noted that while supplies sent by Russia and China have entered the country, in coordination with the Venezuelan government, supplies from the US and other countries have been stockpiled at the Colombian and Brazilian borders. Earmarked for distribution by the Venezuelan opposition, these supplies remained blocked from entering the country by Venezuelan authorities, she said.\n\nPlay Video 1:23 Venezuela: Four dead and hundreds injured in border clashes \u2013 video report\n\nThe politicisation of aid efforts has caused widespread alarm in the international aid community. Many have watched with dismay as supporters of both sides have sought to funnel aid to the advantage of one or other of the rival parties, some trying to back the government of Maduro, others the opposition led by Juan Guaid\u00f3, the self-declared interim president, who is championed by the US.\n\nDiCarlo\u2019s presentation to the security council followed violent clashes at the weekend that focused on failed efforts to deliver aid to the Venezuelan opposition.\n\nQuoting Colombian and UN human rights officials, DiCarlo blamed the involvement of pro-government armed elements in the violent attacks on protestors at Venezuela\u2019s borders that left four dead and 285 injured.\n\nSpeaking on behalf of the US, Elliott Abrams, the Trump administration\u2019s special representative for Venezuela, called on the members of the security council to \u201cpressure the illegitimate regime to peacefully step down\u201d, accusing Maduro of preferring to \u201cblock and burn donated medicine and bread than see it in the hands of Venezuelan children\u201d.\n\nRussia\u2019s representative, Vassily Nebenzia, countered by painting US-backed efforts to deliver aid at the weekend as \u201can attempted illegal state border crossing for the delivery of unknown cargo\u201d, adding that the aid had not been requested by the Venezuelan government.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A pharmacy in Caracas.

Spain\u2019s prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez, said on Wednesday that while it was clear Maduro had \u201cno intention of negotiating\u201d, Spain was opposed to any foreign military intervention in the economically-strapped country.\n\nHe \u201cdoes not want sincere negotiations\u201d, said Spain\u2019s socialist leader, who earlier this month recognised Guaid\u00f3 as interim leader of Venezuela after Maduro rejected pressure to call a snap general election.\n\nS\u00e1nchez, however, firmly rejected any foreign military intervention to topple Maduro, which the US has touted as a possibility.\n\nWe express \u201cour rejection of any non-peaceful solution, and particularly any foreign military intervention in Venezuela,\u201d he told lawmakers.\n\n\u201cThere are some mistakes of the past that must not be committed again.\u201d\n\n\u2022 The headline on this article was amended on 5 March 2019. It had previously suggested that infant mortality was said to have doubled during Venezuela\u2019s political crisis.",

Maduro denies a humanitarian crisis exists, blaming the Trump administration for mounting a coup against him.\n\n\u201cWe must work together to end a humanitarian disaster,\u201d Trump said in Miami. \u201cUnfortunately, Dictator Maduro has blocked this lifesaving aid from entering the country,\u201d he said, claiming the leader was happy to see his people starve.\n\nAmong a number of mentions of Cuba, the socialist country with which the Obama administration moved to normalise relations, Trump claimed the Venezuelan armed forces were \u201crisking their future, their lives and Venezuela\u2019s future for [Maduro], a man controlled by the Cuban military and protected by a private army of Cuban soldiers\u201d.\n\n\u201cMaduro is not a Venezuelan patriot,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe is a Cuban puppet, that\u2019s what he is.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe eyes of the entire world,\u201d he said, were on the Maduro regime \u201ctoday, and every day in the future.

    "text": "Juan Guaid\u00f3 calls for volunteers to carry stockpiled US aid over the borders of two countries on Saturday\n\nMembers of Venezuela\u2019s opposition are gathering in C\u00facuta, Colombia to shift stockpiled US aid to their homeland this weekend in defiance of their country\u2019s embattled president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\n\n\n\n\u201cSaturday will be a day that goes down in our history,\u201d said Omar Lares, the former mayor of Campo El\u00edas in western Venezuela, who has been living in exile in the border city for two years and is now helping coordinate Saturday\u2019s planned delivery of aid.\n\nMaduro government and Richard Branson to hold rival Venezuela concerts Read more\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working overtime to get the food and medicine that people so desperately need,\u201d Lares said, speaking in the lobby of the Casino Internacional hotel in C\u00facuta, which has become one of the opposition\u2019s impromptu bases of operations over the last month.\n\nThe Brazilian government said on Tuesday that it would also deliver humanitarian aid to the Venezuelan border by 23 February at the request of Juan Guaid\u00f3, the Venezuelan opposition leader.\n\nThe distribution of the food and medicine from the northern Brazilian city of Boa Vista across the border would be in Venezuelan trucks driven by Venezuelan citizens organized by Guaid\u00f3, Brazil\u2019s presidential spokesman General Otavio Rego Barros said.\n\nGuaid\u00f3, who has been recognised by the US and dozens more countries as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate interim president, set a deadline of Saturday for the aid to move across the border, though representatives in C\u00facuta, Caracas and Washington are yet to decide how the aid will cross.\n\nGuaid\u00f3 called for caravans of volunteers to carry the aid across at a speech before thousands of supporters in Caracas last week, though it would pit those civilians against the military \u2013 loyal to Maduro \u2013 which is under orders to block the aid.\n\nFor now, the shipments of aid sit in a warehouse next to the Tienditas bridge, connecting the two countries, which was finished in 2016 but never inaugurated. Although thousands cross the nearby Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar bridge on foot every day, the border has been closed to most vehicles since 2015 following a string of disputes between the two countries.\n\nIn advance of the first shipment of aid to the border, Maduro had the Tienditas bridge blockaded with containers and an oil tank. The bridge had long been lightly barricaded with a wire fence, aimed at keeping out contraband smugglers.\n\nWhile in part a bid to get much-needed food and medicine to Venezuela\u2019s suffering population, Saturday\u2019s aid mission is also, Guaid\u00f3 and the Trump administration have said, intended to weaken Maduro by forcing the military to disobey their boss and allow the aid on to Venezuelan soil, which could play into Maduro\u2019s narrative that the US is seeking to invade.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Food and medical aid being unloaded from a US Air Force C-17 aircraft at Camilo Daza airport in C\u00facuta. Photograph: Ra\u00fal Arboleda/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cYou will find no safe harbour, no easy exit and no way out. You will lose everything,\u201d Donald Trump said in a speech in at Florida International University in Miami on Monday before large American and Venezuelan flags. \u201cWe seek a peaceful transition of power, but all options are open.\u201d\n\nMany humanitarian groups have distanced themselves from the aid operation, given its overtly political nature. \u201cHumanitarian action needs to be independent of political, military or any other objectives,\u201d UN spokesman St\u00e9phane Dujarric told reporters in New York last week.\n\nThe move comes against the backdrop of a propaganda war between Guaid\u00f3 and Maduro, with rival concerts set up in support of each president\u2019s stance over the aid.\n\nRichard Branson, the billionaire founder of the Virgin Group, threw his clout and cash behind Guaid\u00f3\u2019s efforts earlier this month when he announced a concert in C\u00facuta to raise funds to relieve Venezuela\u2019s humanitarian crisis, and to pressure Maduro to open up his country\u2019s borders. That concert, which will take place on Friday, is expected to draw hundreds of thousands of attendees.\n\n\u201cVenezuela sadly has not become the utopia that the current administration of Venezuela or the past administration were hoping for, and that has resulted in a lot of people literally dying from lack of medical help,\u201d Branson told the Associated Press in a telephone interview from Necker, his private island in the British Virgin Islands, on Monday. \u201cI think it will draw attention to the problem on a global basis.\u201d\n\nMaduro\u2019s rival concert will take place on Saturday and Sunday, over the border from the one in Colombia organised by Branson, Venezuela\u2019s information minister Jorge Rodr\u00edguez announced on Monday. In an apparent retort to the US aid project, Rodr\u00edguez announced that 20,000 boxes of food aid would be sent to C\u00facuta.\n\nGuaid\u00f3 lambasted the move by Maduro\u2019s government to put on a rival concert, calling it \u201cdesperate\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rosa \u00c1lvarez from Maracay, Venezuela has been living in C\u00facuta for a month now.

How many concerts are they going to stage?\u201d\n\nSince 2015, some three million Venezuelans have fled spiralling hyperinflation and widespread shortages of food and medicine, with almost 1.5 million staying in Colombia, according to UNHCR. Many refugees and migrants cross at the Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar bridge, the busiest of Colombia\u2019s border crossings, just outside C\u00facuta.\n\n\u201cMaduro says that Venezuela shouldn\u2019t be begging for food,\u201d said Rosa \u00c1lvarez, a Venezuelan migrant from Maracay who was queueing for a meal at a soup kitchen near the bridge. \u201cBut look at what we are having to do right now.\u201d\n\nA friend of hers quickly joined in.\n\n\u201cPeople are dying in our country,\u201d said Misleidy Casta\u00f1o, from Valencia in northern Venezuela. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in going to any concert, but it if it helps get aid into Venezuela, it can only be a good thing.\u201d",

    "description": "In the wake of the scandal, it became harder to launder money through investment in Panamanian real estate for Venezuelans who grew rich on the back of their political connections On Avenida Balboa, Panama City\u2019s premier seafront avenue, the 50 story tower bl\u2026",
    "text": "In the wake of the scandal, it became harder to launder money through investment in Panamanian real estate for Venezuelans who grew rich on the back of their political connections\n\nOn Avenida Balboa, Panama City\u2019s premier seafront avenue, the 50 story tower blocks form a near continuous wall of glass to the Pacific Ocean. At night, however, most of the luxury apartments remain in darkness and the basement casinos are eerily deserted.\n\nPanamanian real estate was a favourite investment of the boliburgues, Venezuelans who grew rich on the back of their political connections to the late president Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and his successor Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\n\nBut in the wake of the Panama Papers scandal it has become increasingly hard to launder money through the country, cutting off a potential exit route for those looking to cut loose from Maduro\u2019s embattled regime.\n\n\u201cThe Panamanian real estate boom began in 2005 \u2013 the Colombians came first, then the Venezuelans,\u201d says Ernesto Gonzalez, an investment advisor for Dproperty, a local property broker. \u201cThey would sometimes buy up seven or eight luxury apartments in the same building and leave them vacant but the market has slowed dramatically in recent years, especially after the Panama Papers.\u201d\n\nWhat are the Panama Papers? A guide to history's biggest data leak Read more\n\nThe April 2016 publication of 11 million documents taken from Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca shed light on the mechanisms by which Chavistas built their wealth.\n\nAs part of the Panama Papers investigation Venezuelan journalists Ewald Scharfenburg and Alfredo Meza sifted through hundreds of thousands of documents relating to more than 700 of their compatriots.\n\n\u201cCh\u00e1vez, with good reason, was suspicious of the country\u2019s traditional business elite, so he created a new one,\u201d says Scharfenburg. \u201cThrough its government connections the new elite amassed huge fortunes, both by over-billing state entities and through preferential access to dollars, which became a huge opportunity for self-enrichment.\u201d\n\nIn 2003 Ch\u00e1vez pegged the bolivar, the national currency, to the US dollar. As the bolivar devalued in real terms, huge arbitrage options opened up for individuals and companies who could buy dollars at the official rate and sell them on the black market, often at over 100 times their purchase value.\n\nWith a dollarized economy, visa-free travel and a financial sector with a habit of turning a blind eye, Panama \u2013 along with Miami, Spain and Nicaragua \u2013 became a favourite destination for offshore investment and, for a while, the boligburgues could lead their often ostentatious retirements undisturbed.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Panama Papers scandal cut off a potential exit route for those looking to cut loose from Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s embattled regime. Photograph: HANDOUT/Reuters\n\nJuan Guaid\u00f3 \u2013 the opposition leader leader now recognized as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate leader by dozens of western governments \u2013 has offered amnesty to Venezuelan soldiers who defect. US security adviseer John Bolton has suggested that Maduro and his inner circle should take \u201ca long, quiet retirement \u2026 on a nice beach somewhere far from Venezuela.\u201d\n\nBut the boliburgues can be forgiven for not taking Bolton at his word. Senior Panamanian sources told The Guardian that since early 2017 the US\u2019s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) had been working with the Lima Group of 12 Latin American countries and Canada to identify illegal offshore assets belonging to members of the Maduro regime.\n\nIn November Miami courts ruled that Alejandro Andrade, Chavez\u2019s private secretary turned head of treasury, had accepted $1bn in bribes for providing access to preferential currency rates as part of a money laundering scam. He received a 10-year sentence and his Florida mansion, collection of classic cars and 17 racehorses are to be auctioned by the US treasury.\n\n\u201cThe Andrade case was an inflection point,\u201d says Scharfenburg. \u201cIt was assumed he had done a deal with US authorities to escape prosecution. Since 2016, the US\u2019s approach has changed, the boliburgues know they are under vigilance and they are increasingly trying to move their cash to places like Turkey and the UAE.\u201d\n\nIn October federal courts also gave a 10-year sentence to Matthias Krull, a Panama-based banker who allegedly managed accounts for 500 Venezuelan clients, for his role in a scheme to wash funds from the Venezuelan national oil company through the exchange rate system. Providing evidence as part of his plea deal, Krull implicated Raul Gorr\u00edn, the man responsible for turning opposition media network Globovisi\u00f3n into pro-Maduro outlet and three sons-in-law of the president. US prosecutors unsealed an indictment against Gorr\u00edn for money-laundering and bribery in November.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Venezuela\u2019s self-proclaimed interim president Juan Guaid\u00f3 has offered amnesty to Venezuelan soldiers who defect. Photograph: Ariana Cubillos/AP\n\nIn a separate case uncovered by the Panama Papers investigation, Spanish authorities arrested Claudia Patricia D\u00edaz Guill\u00e9n and her husband Adr\u00edan Vel\u00e1squez. He had been employed as Chavez\u2019s bodyguard while she had been his personal nurse before replacing Andrade as head of treasury in 2011. The pair are accused of pocketing over $4bn through an exotic blend of Seychelles listed shell companies and Andorran banks.

Libertad Is Restored'\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Martin Mejia/AP Martin Mejia/AP\n\nVice President Pence traveled to Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, on Monday and urged regional leaders to support Juan Guaid\u00f3, the self-proclaimed interim president of Venezuela, vowing that the U.S. will stand with the opposition leader \"until your libertad is restored.\"\n\nPence also announced U.S. sanctions against several border-state governors aligned with embattled Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro who are said to be involved in blocking shipments of humanitarian aid from reaching Venezuelans.\n\nMilitary forces have prevented most of the food and medicine from crossing the country's borders with Brazil and Colombia. Clashes with protesters and volunteers trying to unload truckloads of aid resulted in the deaths of least four people this weekend. Hundreds more were wounded.\n\nTrucks carrying items were torched, amid tear gas fired by the military and attacks waged by paramilitary groups, as NPR has reported.\n\n\"Just days ago, as the world watched, the tyrant in Caracas danced as his henchmen burned truckloads of food and medicine, and murdered civilians,\" Pence said in remarks to members of the Lima Group, a coalition of nations formed to address the Venezuela turmoil.\n\n\"Saturday was a tragic day for the families of those who lost their lives and we mourn for those who mourn,\" Pence said. \"It was also a tragic day for the suffering people of Venezuela, but it was also just one more day in Venezuela's long and inevitable journey from tyranny to freedom.\"\n\nMaduro's government, however, views the aid shipments as a pretext for foreign invasion.\n\nGuaid\u00f3 and other opposition leaders had hoped the aid would loosen Maduro's grip on the country. Under the socialist regime, the once prospering country has suffered massive inflation and well as shortages of food and medicine. Millions of desperate Venezuelans have fled the country.\n\nIf Maduro remains in charge of Venezuela, Pence said he expects it will result in two million more refugees.\n\nPence noted Monday that the U.S. has sent five military transport aircraft carrying 400 tons of food and medicine to Colombia and Brazil in the past two weeks \u2014 and that those efforts will only increase. New areas along Venezuela's borders, he said, are being identified to prepare for the delivery of additional aid.\n\nThe vice president said the U.S. has provided more than $139 million in aid to Venezuela's people, and will provide $56 million to support U.S. partners in the region.\n\nIn his speech, Pence also appealed to armed forces loyal to Maduro, echoing President Trump's recent warning that those who chose Maduro over Guaid\u00f3 \"will find no safe harbor, no easy exit and no way out. You will lose everything.\"\n\nNearly 200 members of the military have already defected, said Pence, who later met with dozens of families who had fled Venezuela.\n\nHe gave the Lima Group nations specific steps they should take to isolate and shun Maduro: immediately freeze the assets of PDVSA, Venezuela's state-owned oil company, and transfer ownership of Venezuelan assets from Maduro's government to Guaid\u00f3's.\n\nThe U.S. has already imposed sanctions on PDVSA and on officials with Maduro's government. The additional sanctions announced Monday, according to the Treasury Department, target \"the Governors of four Venezuelan states involved in endemic corruption and in blocking the delivery of critical humanitarian aid, thereby exacerbating the ongoing humanitarian crisis caused by the illegitimate Maduro regime.\"\n\nPence said that \"even stronger sanctions\" will be announced in the days ahead \"against the regime's corrupt financial networks.\" U.S. officials have repeatedly said that all options, including military action, are on the table to try to remove Maduro.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ricardo Moraes/Reuters Ricardo Moraes/Reuters\n\nTo attend Monday's meeting in Bogot\u00e1, Guaid\u00f3 defied a travel ban that Maduro's government has imposed on him. He delivered a speech in which he thanked leaders for their support of Venezuela's democratic cause and humanitarian aid.\n\nHe then asked for a minute of silence to reflect on Saturday's brutality.\n\n\"You saw in one day how sadistic they were when they torched the medicines and food in front of people who are hungry, people in dire need of medicine. The entire world saw what Venezuela has been enduring for years,\" Guaid\u00f3 said.\n\nThe 35-year-old opposition leader was recently elected head of Venezuela's National Assembly, and grabbed the world stage in January by taking the oath of office in Caracas and declaring himself interim president. His announcement was met by swift support from the United States and several other nations.\n\nMaduro had recently been sworn in for a second term, and Guaid\u00f3 argued that the presidential election was illegitimate, plagued by corruption and repression.\n\nBefore Monday's meeting, some Venezuelans indicated that Guaid\u00f3 might make a bid for the use of force against Maduro when meeting with Pence. They will \"demand an escalation in diplomatic pressure and in the use of force against the dictatorship,\" politician Julio Borges said Sunday.\n\nOne local government worker told NPR that the unrest has left people tired and frustrated.\n\n\"If they tell us to be out on the streets for 30 days without eating to oust this government, we'd all be out there,\" said Carolina, who refused to give her last name for fear of losing her job. She added that impoverished Venezuelans have reached a breaking point but that the opposition was moving too slowly.",

    "text": "Trump's Venezuela Moves Follow Long History Of Intervention In Latin America\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption John Gaps/AP John Gaps/AP\n\nUpdated on Feb. 25 at 5:45 p.m. ET\n\nWhen President Trump spoke in Florida earlier this month, he issued a stern warning about Venezuela: Members of the armed forces who continue to support President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro \"will find no safe harbor, no easy exit and no way out,\" he said. \"You will lose everything.\"\n\nTrump said the administration wants \"a peaceful transition of power, but all options are open\" \u2014 suggesting the possibility of military involvement.\n\nVice President Pence visited Colombia Monday and announced new economic sanctions against Venezuelan politicians aligned with Maduro.\n\nThat followed a weekend of violent clashes when Venezuelan security forces blocked most of the humanitarian aid that U.S.-backed opposition activists tried to bring into Venezuela. Four people were reported killed and hundreds injured.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Yuri Cortez/AFP/Getty Images Yuri Cortez/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWhile many Venezuelans disapprove of Maduro and have called for international assistance, many in Latin America are wary of America's moves. Even for some of Maduro's enemies, Washington's efforts to oust the Venezuelan leader raise concern because of the history of U.S. intervention in the region.\n\nIt is \"a long history that starts in Mexico,\" says Enrique Krauze, a noted Mexican historian. The Mexican-American War, the brutal two-year conflict in the mid-19th century, ended with Mexico losing \u2014 or as Krauze says, being robbed of \u2014 half its territory.\n\n\"It would be hard to name a country where the United States didn't have an intervention,\" he emphasizes.\n\nOver 40 regime changes in a century\n\nThe United States participated, directly or indirectly, in Latin American regime change more than 40 times in the last century, according to historian John Coatsworth. That figure doesn't include a number of failed missions like the 1961 Bay of Pigs assault in Cuba.\n\nSome of the more stinging U.S. moves included the ouster of democratically elected governments in Guatemala in 1954, in Brazil a decade later and in Chile in 1973. Chilean President Salvador Allende was deposed in a violent coup by CIA-backed opponents, and the U.S. government long supported his replacement, the dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Martin Thomas/AFP/Getty Images Martin Thomas/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn addition to covert support for insurgencies, the U.S. has invaded its southern neighbors numerous times. For instance, the U.S. launched invasions of the Dominican Republic (1916), Grenada (1983) and Panama (1989).\n\nThe motives were varied and are often still debated. Writing in Harvard University's ReVista magazine, Coatsworth says, \"two factors seem to have been crucial in tipping decision makers toward intervention: domestic politics and global strategy.\" Much of the interference occurred while America was competing against the Soviet Union for influence around the world, even as U.S. leaders sought to shore up political support at home.\n\nOne bloody chapter that recently re-entered debate is the U.S. government's roles in Central America's civil wars in the 1980s, including support for death squads in El Salvador and Contra guerrillas in Nicaragua.\n\nThe Trump administration's special envoy for Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, was convicted of withholding information about the Iran-Contra scandal from Congress but later received a pardon from President George H.W. Bush. This month, Congress members grilled Abrams and questioned whether he would speak truthfully.\n\nPolitics Controversial Past Comes Back To Haunt Elliott Abrams At House Hearing Controversial Past Comes Back To Haunt Elliott Abrams At House Hearing Listen \u00b7 3:29 3:29\n\nIn 2002, the U.S. government allegedly had prior knowledge of an abortive coup against Venezuela's then president, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, although President George W. Bush's administration denied any involvement. Abrams was a senior White House official at that time as well.\n\nTricky balancing act\n\nNow, historian Krauze says, the world wants to stop the humanitarian crisis he calls the \"slow genocide\" of the Venezuelan people.\n\nVenezuela was once considered the richest country in Latin America, and it holds the world's largest oil reserves. Many world leaders, analysts and rights groups blame Maduro for enabling the country's spiraling problems such as hyperinflation, crime, hunger and shortages of medicine and basic goods.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Yuri Cortez/AFP/Getty Images Yuri Cortez/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe U.S. and more than 50 other countries' governments have issued statements recognizing congressional leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 as Venezuela's rightful president, according to Prodavinci, an independent website for Venezuela analysis. The Maduro administration said earlier this month it had enlisted about as many countries, including China and Russia, in its support. Most Latin American governments now back Guaid\u00f3. Mexico's president says the country is neutral and is calling for dialogue.\n\nWith a combination of sanctions, diplomatic pressure and heightened warnings, the United States is playing a difficult balancing act. It cannot be seen as leading the charge in Venezuela, says John Feeley, who resigned as U.S. ambassador to Panama last year, later citing differences with Trump.\n\n\"Precisely the history of U.S. intervention in Latin America is such that it always seems to engender a worse backlash than the original issue that mattered to American interests,\" he says.\n\nMexico's former foreign minister, Jorge Casta\u00f1eda, warns that the United States should not take too large a role in Maduro's ouster. While Bolivia, Cuba, El Salvador and Nicaragua continue to back the embattled leader, Casta\u00f1eda fears that a larger U.S. leadership role would rally more of Latin America's left to Maduro's defense.\n\n\"It's not so much that it should be leading from behind; it shouldn't be leading period. It should be doing what it is doing, not less, but not more,\" Casta\u00f1eda says.\n\nYet, with speeches like the one in Miami, Trump was working to \"Americanize the crisis,\" according to Greg Weeks, a University of North Carolina professor who edits the journal The Latin Americanist.\n\n\"The more you Americanize the situation, the worse the eventual result for the average Venezuelan,\" he wrote on his blog on Tuesday. \"It badly undermines whatever government comes next and increases the chances of armed insurrection.\"\n\nWith Trump campaigning for re-election, Weeks assessed from the speech that U.S. domestic politics are a strong force behind the president's push to oust Maduro.\n\nFormer ambassador Feeley says he hopes Trump takes a diplomatic path. The repercussions of a U.S. intervention in Venezuela would undermine recent progress made in the region, he says.\n\n\"I think that the last 25 years of U.S. Latin American diplomacy have actually gone a long way,\" he says, \"via trade agreements, people-to-people diplomacy to pushing back against that legacy.\"",

His assistant Carlos Salinas has died from poisoning.\"\n\nAccording to BNO News, Voluntad Popular, the opposition party of Juan Guaid\u00f3, says that the Venezuelan lawmaker was poisoned in the city of C\u00facuta near the Colombia-Venezuela border, along with his cousin who died.\n\nBNO News reports that it's believed that the poison used was Burundanga, known as \"devil's breath,\" a drug that is often used for motion sickness, but that has also reportedly been used in Latin America for robberies and sexual assaults. The drug has also been the subject of viral urban legends in the US.\n\nNeither the party nor Rubio directly called the alleged poisoning a political attack. In a statement, the party said, \"We wait for the results of the investigation by the Colombian authorities to establish the facts.\"\n\nIn another tweet, directly following one about the \"#MaduroCrimeFamily,\" Rubio posted uncaptioned before and after picture of former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, with the before showing a photo of him in power, and the after showing him beaten to a bloody pulp. The tweet, in the context of his series of recent tweets on Venezuela and Maduro, seems to be a veiled warning for Maduro, who is considered to be a leader that's overdue for recall.\n\nA deepening crisis\n\nOver the weekend, the border between Colombia and Venezuela has exploded in conflict.\n\nTwo died and 300 were injured Saturday near the border as troops loyal to President Nicolas Maduro, who believes the aid is part of a potential coup, clashed with demonstrators who were protesting the blockage of US aid coming through Colombia.\n\nThe shipments included much-needed food and medicine for the country that has been starved by economic crisis.\n\nRead more: Photos show chaos in Venezuela as protesters and soldiers clash over humanitarian aid shipments\n\nProtesters told the Associated Press that Maduro's troops set 2 aid shipments on fire, and fired tear gas at protesters.\n\nAfter the protests, opposition leader Guaido, who much of the international community recognize as Venezuela's rightful leader, did not call for more protests\n\nMarco Rubio's long battle with Maduro\n\nU.S. Senator Marco Rubio, R-Fla., greets Venezuelan migrants near the Simon Bolivar International Bridge, which connects Colombia with Venezuela, in La Parada, near Cucuta, Colombia, Sunday, Feb. 17, 2019.

AP Photo/Fernando Vergara\n\nSenator Rubio has been a longtime opponent of Maduro's, and has recently ramped up his statements against the Venezuelan leader.\n\nIn January, Rubio suggested that Maduro's ouster was a given, saying, \"It's just a matter of time. The only thing we don't know is how long it will take \u2014 and whether it will be peaceful or bloody.\"\n\nRubio is said to have been key in President Trump's decision to back opposition leader Guaid\u00f3 and send aid.\n\nRubio, a Cuban-American, stands with other Cuban-American leaders in his opposition to Maduro, who's variant of socialism has been associated with the Cuban government.\n\nLast week, Rubio visited the Colombian-Venezuelan border, where he asked the Venezuelan military to let aid shipments through, and spoke alongside delegates of Guaido's team.\n\n\"Soon, Mr. President, we will be standing together in a free Venezuela,\" he said.\n\nVice President Mike Pence is scheduled to meet with Guaido on Monday.",

Bernie Sanders of Vermont on Monday went after President Donald Trump for his stance on Saudi Arabia, but spoke positively about Trump's efforts to hold dialogue with North Korea.\n\nDuring a CNN town hall on Sanders' agenda for his 2020 presidential campaign, the senator was pressured on his stance on the crisis in Venezuela and whether he feels Nicol\u00e1s Maduro is a dictator.\n\nSanders stopped short of describing Maduro in these terms, but conceded the country's most recent elections were \"undemocratic.\" The Vermont senator also urged against embracing military intervention in Venezuela, citing the US government's dubious history in Latin America.\n\nRead more: Bernie Sanders pledges to support whoever the Democratic nominee is in 2020 to defeat Trump, but hopes it'll be him\n\nMeanwhile, he questioned why Trump has been so interested in democracy in Venezuela while continuing to be friendly with Saudi Arabia's royal family.\n\n\"I do find it interesting that Trump is very concerned about what goes on in Venezuela, but what about the last election that took place in Saudi Arabia?

    "title": "Trump's latest line of attack against 2020 Democrats is to tie them to socialism",
    "description": "President Donald Trump is trying to drum up fears about socialism as he seeks to discredit an expanding field of Democratic candidates for 2020. Trump has repeatedly pointed to the chaotic situation in Venezuela as a sign the US can't afford to turn to social\u2026",
    "text": "President Donald Trump has debuted a new line line of attack against the rapidly expanding field of 2020 Democratic candidates by positioning himself as the antithesis to the boogeyman of socialism.\n\nTrump is attempting to convince US voters that Democrats want to shove socialism down their throats while contending that reelecting him will prevent that.\n\nAfter Sen. Bernie Sanders \u2014a self-declared democratic socialist\u2014 on Tuesday announced he's running for president again in 2020, the Trump campaign in a statement said: \"Bernie Sanders has already won the debate in the Democrat primary, because every candidate is embracing his brand of socialism.\"\n\nIn particular, the Trump camp is using the example of Venezuela to highlight the dangers of socialist policies.\n\n\"But the American people will reject an agenda of sky-high tax rates, government-run health care and coddling dictators like those in Venezuela,\" the campaign's statement on Sanders' continued. \"Only President Trump will keep America free, prosperous and safe.\"\n\nTrump is zeroing-in on socialism\n\nSocialism has long been a dirty word in America's political discourse, largely since the Cold War and the anti-Soviet sentiments that permeated the US. Even as recently as 2011\u2014years after the collapse of the Soviet Union \u2014 Pew Research Center found that 60% of Americans had a negative view of the word socialism, with just 31% giving the word a positive connotation.\n\nRead more: Here's the difference between a 'socialist' and a 'Democratic socialist'\n\nTrump has played on those long-held fears by repeatedly attacking the policies of Nicolas Maduro's government in Venezuela.\n\nDuring his State of the Union address in early February, Trump said the US stands with the Venezuelan people \"in their noble quest for freedom\" as he condemned the \"brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair.\"\n\nTrump echoed this sentiments in a speech on the Venezuela crisis at Florida International University on Monday. \"There's nothing less democratic than socialism,\" Trump said during the speech.\n\nTrump is attempting to connect socialism to Democrats\n\nIn turn, Trump has also tried to connect the situation in Venezuela to Democrats.\n\n\"Here, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country,\" Trump said during his State of the Union after he mentioned Venezuela. \"America was founded on liberty and independence \u2014 not government coercion, domination, and control. We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.\"\n\nSimilarly, in his Venezuela speech in Florida, Trump said, \"To those who would try to impose socialism on the United States, we again deliver a very simple message: America will never be a socialist country.\"\n\nRead more: Trump is going all out to tie Democrats to his latest political boogeyman: socialism\n\nThe president seems to be directing this message at Democratic lawmakers like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the increasingly influential freshman congresswoman who's a self-described socialist, and Sanders. This left wing of the Democratic party has pushed for the implementation of policies such as universal healthcare (Medicare for All) and tuition-free college, which critics and advocates alike have linked to socialism.\n\nWhile similar policies have been adopted in other developed countries without the collapse of democratic institutions or the eradication of capitalism, Trump has seized upon the negative connotations tied to socialism to suggest politicians like Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders are driving the US down a dangerous, more authoritarian road.\n\nIn a recent email to supporters, the Trump campaign said Sanders is running on a platform of \"FULL-BLOWN SOCIALISM.\" The email warned that \"a new wave of radical socialist Democrats is coming.\"\n\nResponding to this email in a post on Instagram, Sanders said the president is \"scared\" because of the Vermont senator's record-setting fundraising on the first day of his campaign.\n\nSome Democrats distance themselves from socialist label\n\nThough socialism continues to be an incendiary topic in the US, Democratic voters appear to be warming up to it. An August 2018 Gallup poll found 57% of Democrats have a positive view of socialism, compared to just 16% of Republicans.\n\nMany Americans seem to be quite open to Ocasio-Cortez's ideas as well, especially increasing taxes on the rich, despite attempts from Republicans and some centrist Democrats to dismiss the proposals as radical.\n\nRead more: Nearly half of Americans support Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's 70% marginal tax on the super-rich, according a new poll\n\nWith that said, Democratic candidates for 2020 do not all openly embrace the label \"socialist\" or \"democratic socialist\" in the same way Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez have.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris, widely considered a top contender, on Monday explicitly stated she is not a \"democratic socialist.\"\n\nHarris in an interview with NBC News on Tuesday also contended Medicare for All, which has gained momentum with Democratic lawmakers, is not socialism.\n\n\"No, no. It's about providing health care to all people,\" Harris, who's adopted Medicare for All as part of her 2020 platform, said during the interview.\n\nRead more: Bernie Sanders raked in $6 million in donations just 24 hours after announcing his 2020 presidential bid\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who's also joined the race, has rejected policies like tuition-free college. \"If I was a magic genie and could give that to everyone and we could afford it, I would,\" Klobuchar said on Monday.\n\nIndeed, despite the fact many voters have shifted their views on socialism in the past decade or so, politicians are still wary of embracing the label or even policies associated with it.",

    "title": "Q&A WITH MATT DUSS: Bernie Sanders' foreign policy adviser breaks down the senator's progressive global agenda for 2020",
    "description": "Sen. Bernie Sanders is running for president again, and this time around he plans to be much more vocal about foreign policy. Matt Duss, Sanders' foreign policy adviser, spoke with INSIDER about the senator's global affairs priorities. Duss also addressed som\u2026",
    "text": "It's been less than a week since Sen. Bernie Sanders announced he's running for president again and he's already dominating headlines about the 2020 race in a broad, diverse field of candidates.\n\nSanders in 2016 went from being a relatively obscure leftist figure to a household name and one of the most popular politicians in the country. His campaign for the presidency was ultimately unsuccessful, but he left his mark on both the Democratic Party and the country by making ideas previously considered radical in the realm of US politics fairly mainstream.\n\nBut as Sanders was frequently criticized in 2016 for having a somewhat jumbled approach to foreign policy. Early on, his campaign website didn't have a foreign policy section, and he stumbled on the topic during presidential debates.\n\nSince 2016, however, Sanders has dedicated a significant amount of his time and energy to global affairs.\n\nHe's delivered two major speeches on foreign policy, one at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in October 2018 and another in September 2017 at Westminster College\u2014 where Winston Churchill gave his infamous \"Iron Curtain\" speech.\n\nSanders is also leading the charge on a Senate resolution to end US support for Saudi Arabia in Yemen.\n\nRead more: Senate rebels against Trump, moves to withdraw US support for Saudi Arabia in Yemen in historic vote\n\nMatt Duss, 46, has been at Sanders' side as his foreign policy adviser throughout this shift, and he'll be helping the senator craft his approach to global affairs along the campaign trail.\n\nMatt Duss (center) back in his days as a blogger in 2010. He's now advising Sen. Bernie Sanders on all things foreign policy. Isaac Brekken/Getty Images\n\nDuss, a staunch progressive who broke into the political world as a blogger, has gained prominence among left-leaning foreign policy wonks and added significant credibility to Sanders on matters of global import.\n\nRead more: Bernie Sanders slams US support for 'despotic' Saudi Arabia in Yemen and bashes Trump over Khashoggi: 'No more! Enough death. Enough killing.'\n\nSanders' bold approach to domestic politics is reflected in his views on foreign affairs, which at times makes him a fringe figure in Congress. In recent days, for example, he's been criticized by some congressional Democrats for not recognizing Juan Guaid\u00f3 as Venezuela's legitimate leader and for not referring to Nicolas Maduro as a dictator.\n\nDuss spoke with INSIDER last week, offering an intimate view into how Sanders sees the world and what the senator will be prioritizing along the campaign trail. He also addressed the criticism Sanders has received on the subject of foreign policy, and why he feels much of it is unfounded.\n\nEditor's Note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nINSIDER: Sanders faced a fair amount of criticism in 2016 for not having a clear foreign policy vision. How has Sanders evolved since and has he made it more of a priority?\n\nDuss: He certainly has made it more of a priority. There's a great deal of evidence for that, not only in the statements he's made, speeches he's given, but also substantively and legislatively. The Yemen war powers resolution is the most prominent example of [Sanders] being more aggressive on the issue of foreign policy and adding it to the progressive agenda.\n\nComing out of 2016, we recognized that he had a much bigger platform, a much bigger opportunity to move things in a progressive direction and the importance of making foreign policy part of that, which is why he asked me to join the staff.\n\nINSIDER: There are strong anti-interventionist sentiments on both sides of the aisle right now. Barack Obama was fairly critical of the US in a similar way back in 2008, but faced accusations of being unpatriotic as a result. Could Sanders face similar attacks?\n\nDuss: He certainly will. We're seeing it right now with some of the attacks he's getting even from some Democrats on Venezuela.\n\nBut there are shared concerns amongst progressives and conservatives about American militarism, the costs, and many unintended consequences of this kind of interventionism that has guided our approach certainly since 9/11, but even before that.\n\nThe Yemen resolution, the fact that [Sanders] introduced it with Republican Mike Lee as an original co-sponsor as well as Democrat Chris Murphy \u2014 that's an illustration of this, right? Sen. Sanders and Sen. Lee don't agree on a great deal, but they strongly came together around this idea that not only do we need to take a hard look at some of these interventions we're supporting, but we also need to take a hard look and reassert Congress' constitutional authority over these interventions.\n\nThis is where you see a sharp difference between Trump's approach and Sen. Sanders' approach. Trump and a lot of the conservatives who support him see international relations in very zero-sum terms: If someone else is winning the US is losing; the US needs to dominate all these relationships.\n\nSen. Sanders does not see it in those terms, he sees it in very much a positive-sum way: We can all gain when we are working together, multilaterally. We have shared problems and challenges, so we need shared solutions.\n\nINSIDER: You recently told The Nation what it meant to you when in 2008 you heard Obama say he didn't just want to end the Iraq War, he wanted to end \"the mind-set\" that got the US into the war in the first place. But once he entered the White House, Obama encountered a reality that made it difficult to deliver on his campaign's idealistic foreign policy vision. If elected, could Sanders face a similar reality as president?\n\nDuss: That statement [from Obama] meant a lot to me and a lot of other young progressives that I know for a reason \u2014 it really captured something.\n\nBut let's remember that when Obama came into office he had a financial crisis. There was a lot going on and Obama had an idealistic idea of turning the ship on a number of things, including foreign policy. I don't ding him too hard for some of the decisions he made, they made a great deal of sense at the time. In retrospect, some of the decisions led to really problematic outcomes now, such as the decision not to investigate fully the use of torture or other things like that.\n\nAny president has to deal with the world as it is when they take office. But what Sen. Sanders recognizes is building that kind of movement around this idea, and starting a much more robust conversation and a real political consensus about what America's role in the world should be.\n\nNow that's challenging, right? Because foreign policy is not something that is very immediate to a lot of Americans for obvious reasons, but grounding it in this discussion about how we treat ourselves, how we treat our own society, what kind of society we want it, how that is reflected in our foreign policy is the way to go about it.\n\nINSIDER: Congress essentially abdicated its war-making authority with the Authorization for the Use of Military Force (AUMF) in 2001 \u2014 which has since allowed presidents to wage an expansive, ill-defined, global war on terrorism with few obstacles. Will Sanders call for repealing the AUMF along the campaign trail?\n\nDuss: He will be focusing on that. He has said that Yemen is important in itself because it's a humanitarian crisis. The US shouldn't be supporting the Saudi coalition.\n\nThere's the constitutional question of congressional oversight and of reining in these wars, and that relates to the broader set of issues about the 2001 AUMF and the global war on terror. He will be talking about these things.\n\nINSIDER: Does the Yemen resolution have a realistic shot in the Senate? Does Sanders' forceful criticism of Trump jeopardize the fate of the resolution?\n\nDuss: It does have a realistic chance. We have 51 of the 56 who voted with us in December \u2014 they're still in office. Plus we have two new members of the Democratic caucus, both of whom have indicated that they will vote with the caucus, which puts us at 53. We only need 51 votes to move through every stage of this process.\n\nThe Trump administration will put a lot of pressure on Republicans to peel off this thing. But it's the same resolution that passed two months ago. The humanitarian crisis [in Yemen] has only gotten worse.\n\nINSIDER: Sanders' criticism of Israel, particularly on the debate stage in 2016, is notable for multiple reasons. He's Jewish and less susceptible to accusations of anti-Semitism. But it's politically risky. Does Sanders want to radically alter the US-Israel relationship or is he more concerned with the rights of Palestinians and related humanitarian issues?\n\nDuss: I don't think he wants to radically reorient the relationship. He's been clear he supports Israel's right to exist, he supports the two state solution.\n\nBut going back to that debate you mentioned, his point about [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu] has been borne out many, many times. We just saw this week with Netanyahu literally forming an alliance with fascists, people who are identified as terrorists.\n\nBut the approach [Sanders] would support, and has supported, is one that is consistent with our relationships with other countries, which is to say: we support the rights of Israelis and Palestinians to live in security and dignity. And we have to recognize when policy, for example the settlements or the occupation, undermine those goals. So the US needs to speak clearly about that and when necessary we need to take steps to put pressure to stop those policies. [Sanders is] going to be willing to do that.\n\nINSIDER: Sanders has been accused of being too soft on dictatorial leaders like Fidel and Raul Castro, Daniel Ortega, and more recently Nicolas Maduro. Is any of this criticism fair?\n\nDuss: There are times where he's definitely pushed back on some of the reflexive hawkishness of the establishment. But he's always been consistently for human rights and self-determination.\n\nHis statement on Maduro, if you go back to what he initially said, reflects that. He's very clear about Maduro's abuse of his population and the corruption.\n\nBut that doesn't mean that we endorse Trump's approach here. It's making sure that the approach is consistent and grounded in a set of principles \u2014 human dignity, human security.\n\nINSIDER: Sanders is also facing criticism for not recognizing Juan Guaid\u00f3 as the legitimate leader in Venezuela, including from Democrats in Congress, as the US and many of its allies take a stand against Maduro. From the senator's perspective, how should the US approach the crisis in Venezuela?\n\nDuss: No one is defending Maduro \u2014 the senator certainly is not doing that.\n\nBut coming out as Trump has done and sort of putting the US in the lead \u2014 just completely recognizing Guaid\u00f3 as the president\u2014 and putting the US four-square behind the opposition, has the potential to create some possible outcomes that the US is not quite prepared for.\n\nThere are also other people the US could be talking to. It's unfortunate that the Trump administration did not pursue the opening with Cuba that the Obama administration started, because talking to Cuba right now could actually be really useful.\n\nINSIDER: That's an interesting point because Trump is clearly open to dialogue with North Korea, and has defended the notion of talking to your enemies, even as he went after Obama over reopening dialogue Cuba and Iran. What's Sanders' view on this?\n\nDuss: Sen. Sanders was perhaps the only member of the Democratic office to actually compliment Trump's last summit with Kim Jong Un for that reason. Talking is better than threats.\n\nINSIDER: So, if we ultimately have a President Bernie Sanders, would we also see more dialogue with America's geopolitical adversaries?\n\nDuss: We certainly would. We'd be clear about the values and the outcomes the US favors \u2014 self-determination and human rights, respect for people's dignity and their security.\n\nBut the fact is the US is extraordinarily powerful and we don't have to fear sitting down with anyone, whether it's the North Koreans, whether it's Iran, whomever.\n\nINSIDER: Trump has a record of praising dubious world leaders and Sanders has referred to the president as an \"authoritarian.\" Do you agree with the senator?\n\nDuss: [Trump] is certainly behaving in authoritarian ways. There's some ways in which he is being constrained.\n\nBut certainly using the bully pulpit, the huge megaphone that he has on Twitter and elsewhere, to attack the press, to attack progressives, to attack all kinds of people \u2014 these have consequences.\n\nWe've seen violence against the media. We saw this guy who was just arrested planning this huge attack.\n\nLeaders in other countries take notice of what the president of the US says. In talking to activists in other countries, there is no question in their mind that they feel that their oppression and [their leader's] use of these tools to control, oppress, and persecute their own people is being affirmed by the president of the US. That's a huge problem.\n\nINSIDER: If you had to summarize Sanders' worldview as succinctly as possible, what would you say?\n\nDuss: He sees the US as a kind of global facilitator by virtue of our enormous economic, diplomatic power. The US has the ability to bring parties, states, and people around tables to address common challenges that really no other country has.\n\nThat doesn't mean that the US needs to run to the head of every parade or be in charge of everything \u2014 certainly not. But the US does have a role to play in facilitating multilateral cooperation, conversation, and innovation.",

    "text": "Below is the full text of President Donald Trump's second State of the Union address to Congress, as prepared for delivery.\n\n\"Madam Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans:\n\nWe meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential. As we begin a new Congress, I stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all Americans.\n\nMillions of our fellow citizens are watching us now, gathered in this great chamber, hoping that we will govern not as two parties but as one Nation.\n\nThe agenda I will lay out this evening is not a Republican agenda or a Democrat agenda. It is the agenda of the American people.\n\nMany of us campaigned on the same core promises: to defend American jobs and demand fair trade for American workers; to rebuild and revitalize our Nation's infrastructure; to reduce the price of healthcare and prescription drugs; to create an immigration system that is safe, lawful, modern and secure; and to pursue a foreign policy that puts America's interests first.\n\nThere is a new opportunity in American politics, if only we have the courage to seize it. Victory is not winning for our party. Victory is winning for our country.\n\nThis year, America will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the majesty of America's mission, and the power of American pride.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi shakes hands with President Donald Trump as he enters to deliver his State of the Union address. Doug Mills/The New York Times via AP, Pool\n\nIn June, we mark 75 years since the start of what General Dwight D. Eisenhower called the Great Crusade \u2014 the Allied liberation of Europe in World War II. On D-Day, June 6, 1944, 15,000 young American men jumped from the sky, and 60,000 more stormed in from the sea, to save our civilization from tyranny. Here with us tonight are three of those heroes: Private First Class Joseph Reilly, Staff Sergeant Irving Locker, and Sergeant Herman Zeitchik. Gentlemen, we salute you.\n\nIn 2019, we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a quarter of a million miles through space to plant the American flag on the face of the moon. Half a century later, we are joined by one of the Apollo 11 astronauts who planted that flag: Buzz Aldrin. This year, American astronauts will go back to space on American rockets.\n\nIn the 20th century, America saved freedom, transformed science, and redefined the middle class standard of living for the entire world to see. Now, we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this great American adventure, and we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century. An amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within our reach.\n\nWe can make our communities safer, our families stronger, our culture richer, our faith deeper, and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before.\n\nBut we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution \u2014 and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and the common good.\n\nTogether, we can break decades of political stalemate. We can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of America's future. The decision is ours to make.\n\nWe must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction.\n\nTonight, I ask you to choose greatness.\n\nOver the last 2 years, my Administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades.\n\nIn just over 2 years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom \u2014 a boom that has rarely been seen before. We have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs \u2014 something which almost everyone said was impossible to do, but the fact is, we are just getting started.\n\nThe House chamber during the 2019 State of the Union address. MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images\n\nWages are rising at the fastest pace in decades, and growing for blue collar workers, who I promised to fight for, faster than anyone else. Nearly 5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps. The United States economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when I took office, and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world. Unemployment has reached the lowest rate in half a century. African-American, Hispanic-American and Asian-American unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. Unemployment for Americans with disabilities has also reached an all-time low. More people are working now than at any time in our history -- 157 million.\n\nWe passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit.\n\nWe virtually ended the estate, or death, tax on small businesses, ranches, and family farms.\n\nWe eliminated the very unpopular Obamacare individual mandate penalty \u2014 and to give critically ill patients access to life-saving cures, we passed right to try.\n\nMy Administration has cut more regulations in a short time than any other administration during its entire tenure. Companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to historic reductions in taxes and regulations.\n\nWe have unleashed a revolution in American energy \u2014 the United States is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. And now, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy.\n\nAfter 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on earth, and America is winning each and every day. Members of Congress: the State of our Union is strong. Our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before.\n\nOn Friday, it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month alone \u2014 almost double what was expected. An economic miracle is taking place in the United States \u2014 and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations.\n\nIf there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation. It just doesn't work that way!\n\nPresident Donald Trump turns to House speaker Nancy Pelosi of Calif., as he delivers his State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington, as Vice President Mike Pence watches, Tuesday, Feb. 5, 2019. Doug Mills/The New York Times via AP, Pool\n\nWe must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad.\n\nThis new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the Senate - some after years of waiting. The Senate has failed to act on these nominations, which is unfair to the nominees and to our country.\n\nNow is the time for bipartisan action. Believe it or not, we have already proven that it is possible.\n\nIn the last Congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new Farm Bill, historic VA reforms, and after four decades of rejection, we passed VA Accountability so we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans.\n\nAnd just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice reform. Last year, I heard through friends the story of Alice Johnson. I was deeply moved. In 1997, Alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first-time non-violent drug offender. Over the next two decades, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better path. She had a big impact on that prison population \u2014 and far beyond.\n\nAlice's story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing \u2014 and the need to remedy this injustice. She served almost 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the rest of her life.\n\nIn June, I commuted Alice's sentence \u2014 and she is here with us tonight. Alice, thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny.\n\nWhen I saw Alice's beautiful family greet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, I knew I did the right thing.\n\nInspired by stories like Alice's, my Administration worked closely with members of both parties to sign the First Step Act into law. This legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the African-American community. The First Step Act gives non-violent offenders the chance to re-enter society as productive, law-abiding citizens. Now, States across the country are following our lead. America is a Nation that believes in redemption.\n\nAlice Johnson waves as President Donald Trump acknowledges her during his State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Feb. 5, 2019. AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite\n\nWe are also joined tonight by Matthew Charles from Tennessee. In 1996, at age 30, Matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses. Over the next two decades, he completed more than 30 Bible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored fellow inmates. Now, Matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the First Step Act. Matthew, on behalf of all Americans: welcome home.\n\nAs we have seen, when we are united, we can make astonishing strides for our country. Now, Republicans and Democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis.\n\nThe Congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our Government, protect our homeland, and secure our southern border.\n\nNow is the time for the Congress to show the world that America is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business.\n\nAs we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the United States. We have just heard that Mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection. I have ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border to prepare for the tremendous onslaught.\n\nThis is a moral issue. The lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, and financial well\u2011being of all Americans. We have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens. This includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today, who followed the rules and respected our laws. Legal immigrants enrich our Nation and strengthen our society in countless ways. I want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally.\n\nTonight, I am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country.\n\nNo issue better illustrates the divide between America's working class and America's political class than illegal immigration. Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards.\n\nMeanwhile, working class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration \u2014 reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools and hospitals, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net.\n\nTolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate \u2014 it is cruel. One in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. Smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country.\n\nPresident Donald Trump delivers his State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington, as Vice President Mike Pence listens and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., reads the speech, Tuesday, Feb. 5, 2019. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)\n\nHuman traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the United States and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery.\n\nTens of thousands of innocent Americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities \u2014 including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl.\n\nThe savage gang, MS-13, now operates in 20 different American States, and they almost all come through our southern border. Just yesterday, an MS-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in New York City. We are removing these gang members by the thousands, but until we secure our border they're going to keep streaming back in.\n\nYear after year, countless Americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens.\n\nI've gotten to know many wonderful Angel Moms, Dads, and families - no one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache they have endured.\n\nHere tonight is Debra Bissell. Just three weeks ago, Debra's parents, Gerald and Sharon, were burglarized and shot to death in their Reno, Nevada, home by an illegal alien. They were in their eighties and are survived by four children, 11 grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren. Also here tonight are Gerald and Sharon's granddaughter, Heather, and great\u2011granddaughter, Madison.\n\nTo Debra, Heather, Madison, please stand: few can understand your pain. But I will never forget, and I will fight for the memory of Gerald and Sharon, that it should never happen again.\n\nNot one more American life should be lost because our Nation failed to control its very dangerous border.\n\nIn the last 2 years, our brave ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings.\n\nWe are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes: ICE Special Agent Elvin Hernandez. When Elvin was a boy, he and his family legally immigrated to the United States from the Dominican Republic. At the age of eight, Elvin told his dad he wanted to become a Special Agent. Today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking. Elvin says: \"If I can make sure these young girls get their justice, I've done my job.\" Thanks to his work and that of his colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from horror and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars in the last year.\n\nSpecial Agent Hernandez, please stand: We will always support the brave men and women of Law Enforcement \u2014 and I pledge to you tonight that we will never abolish our heroes from ICE.\n\nMy Administration has sent to the Congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our southern border.\n\nIt includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry. In the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall \u2014 but the proper wall never got built. I'll get it built.\n\nThis is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier \u2014 not just a simple concrete wall. It will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way down.\n\nSan Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in the country. In response, and at the request of San Diego residents and political leaders, a strong security wall was put in place. This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings.\n\nThe border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime \u2014 one of the highest in the country, and considered one of our Nation's most dangerous cities. Now, with a powerful barrier in place, El Paso is one of our safest cities.\n\nSimply put, walls work and walls save lives. So let's work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make America safe.\n\nAs we work to defend our people's safety, we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace.\n\nNo one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the new jobs created in the last year. All Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before \u2014 and exactly one century after the Congress passed the Constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in the Congress than ever before.\n\nDemocratic female members of Congress cheer after President Donald Trump said there are more women in Congress than ever before during this State of the Union address on February 5, 2019. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nAs part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere, this Thursday we are launching the first ever Government-wide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries.\n\nTo build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount \u2014 reversing decades of calamitous trade policies.\n\nWe are now making it clear to China that after years of targeting our industries, and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of American jobs and wealth has come to an end.\n\nTherefore, we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion of Chinese goods \u2014 and now our Treasury is receiving billions of dollars a month from a country that never gave us a dime. But I don't blame China for taking advantage of us \u2014 I blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen. I have great respect for President Xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with China. But it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect American jobs.\n\nAnother historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as NAFTA.\n\nI have met the men and women of Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, New Hampshire, and many other States whose dreams were shattered by NAFTA. For years, politicians promised them they would negotiate for a better deal. But no one ever tried \u2014 until now.\n\nOur new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement \u2014 or USMCA \u2014 will replace NAFTA and deliver for American workers: bringing back our manufacturing jobs, expanding American agriculture, protecting intellectual property, and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with four beautiful words: made in the USA.\n\nTonight, I am also asking you to pass the United States Reciprocal Trade Act, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an American product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the same product that they sell to us.\n\nBoth parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of America's crumbling infrastructure.\n\nI know that the Congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill \u2014 and I am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the cutting edge industries of the future. This is not an option. This is a necessity.\n\nPresident Donald Trump delivered his second State of the Union address on Tuesday. Jim Young/Reuters\n\nThe next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs \u2014 and to protect patients with pre-existing conditions.\n\nAlready, as a result of my Administration's efforts, in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years.\n\nBut we must do more. It is unacceptable that Americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place. This is wrong, unfair, and together we can stop it.\n\nI am asking the Congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for American patients. We should also require drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs down.\n\nNo force in history has done more to advance the human condition than American freedom. In recent years we have made remarkable progress in the fight against HIV and AIDS. Scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach. My budget will ask Democrats and Republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the HIV epidemic in the United States within 10 years. Together, we will defeat AIDS in America.\n\nTonight, I am also asking you to join me in another fight that all Americans can get behind: the fight against childhood cancer.\n\nJoining Melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave 10-year-old girl, Grace Eline. Every birthday since she was 4, Grace asked her friends to donate to St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. She did not know that one day she might be a patient herself. Last year, Grace was diagnosed with brain cancer. Immediately, she began radiation treatment. At the same time, she rallied her community and raised more than $40,000 for the fight against cancer. When Grace completed treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read: \"Last Day of Chemo.\" Grace \u2014 you are an inspiration to us all.\n\nMany childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades. My budget will ask the Congress for $500 million over the next 10 years to fund this critical life-saving research.\n\nTo help support working parents, the time has come to pass school choice for America's children. I am also proud to be the first President to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave \u2014 so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child.\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump arrives for President Donald Trump's State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, Feb. 5, 2019. AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite\n\nThere could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our Nation saw in recent days. Lawmakers in New York cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments before birth. These are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world. And then, we had the case of the Governor of Virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth.\n\nTo defend the dignity of every person, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother's womb.\n\nLet us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life. And let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: all children \u2014 born and unborn \u2014 are made in the holy image of God.\n\nThe final part of my agenda is to protect America's National Security.\n\nOver the last 2 years, we have begun to fully rebuild the United States Military \u2014 with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year. We are also getting other nations to pay their fair share. For years, the United States was being treated very unfairly by NATO \u2014 but now we have secured a $100 billion increase in defense spending from NATO allies.\n\nAs part of our military build-up, the United States is developing a state-of-the-art Missile Defense System.\n\nUnder my Administration, we will never apologize for advancing America's interests.\n\nFor example, decades ago the United States entered into a treaty with Russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capabilities. While we followed the agreement to the letter, Russia repeatedly violated its terms. That is why I announced that the United States is officially withdrawing from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, or INF Treaty.\n\nPerhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding China and others, or perhaps we can't -- in which case, we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far.\n\nAs part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the Korean Peninsula. Our hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in 15 months. If I had not been elected President of the United States, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with North Korea with potentially millions of people killed. Much work remains to be done, but my relationship with Kim Jong Un is a good one. And Chairman Kim and I will meet again on February 27 and 28 in Vietnam.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela, and its new interim President, Juan Guaido.\n\nWe stand with the Venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom \u2014 and we condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair.\n\nHere, in the United States, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country. America was founded on liberty and independence -- not government coercion, domination, and control. We are born free, and we will stay free. Tonight, we renew our resolve that America will never be a socialist country.\n\nOne of the most complex set of challenges we face is in the Middle East.\n\nOur approach is based on principled realism \u2014 not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress. For this reason, my Administration recognized the true capital of Israel \u2014 and proudly opened the American Embassy in Jerusalem.\n\nOur brave troops have now been fighting in the Middle East for almost 19 years. In Afghanistan and Iraq, nearly 7,000 American heroes have given their lives. More than 52,000 Americans have been badly wounded. We have spent more than $7 trillion in the Middle East.\n\nAs a candidate for President, I pledged a new approach. Great nations do not fight endless wars.\n\nWhen I took office, ISIS controlled more than 20,000 square miles in Iraq and Syria. Today, we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty killers.\n\nMembers of the cabinet from left: Kirstjen Nielsen, Elaine Chao, Ben Carson, Alex Azar, Alex Acosta, Wilbur Ross, Sonny Perdue, Steven Mnuchin and Mike Pompeo during the State of the Union address on February 5, 2019. Doug Mills/Pool via REUTERS\n\nNow, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of ISIS, it is time to give our brave warriors in Syria a warm welcome home.\n\nI have also accelerated our negotiations to reach a political settlement in Afghanistan. Our troops have fought with unmatched valor \u2014 and thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a political solution to this long and bloody conflict.\n\nIn Afghanistan, my Administration is holding constructive talks with a number of Afghan groups, including the Taliban. As we make progress in these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop presence and focus on counter-terrorism. We do not know whether we will achieve an agreement \u2014 but we do know that after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace.\n\nAbove all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this Nation's power and will to defend our people. Eighteen years ago, terrorists attacked the USS Cole \u2014 and last month American forces killed one of the leaders of the attack.\n\nWe are honored to be joined tonight by Tom Wibberley, whose son, Navy Seaman Craig Wibberley, was one of the 17 sailors we tragically lost. Tom: we vow to always remember the heroes of the USS Cole.\n\nMy Administration has acted decisively to confront the world's leading state sponsor of terror: the radical regime in Iran.\n\nTo ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, I withdrew the United States from the disastrous Iran nuclear deal. And last fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed on a country.\n\nWe will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants death to America and threatens genocide against the Jewish people. We must never ignore the vile poison of anti-Semitism, or those who spread its venomous creed. With one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs.\n\nJust months ago, 11 Jewish-Americans were viciously murdered in an anti-Semitic attack on the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. SWAT Officer Timothy Matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing down the killer. Timothy has just had his 12th surgery \u2014 but he made the trip to be here with us tonight. Officer Matson: we are forever grateful for your courage in the face of evil.\n\nTonight, we are also joined by Pittsburgh survivor Judah Samet. He arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began. But not only did Judah narrowly escape death last fall \u2014 more than seven decades ago, he narrowly survived the Nazi concentration camps. Today is Judah's 81st birthday. Judah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75 years ago, after 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his family were put on a train, and told they were going to another camp. Suddenly the train screeched to a halt. A soldier appeared. Judah's family braced for the worst. Then, his father cried out with joy: \"It's the Americans.\"\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - FEBRUARY 05: Holocaust survivor Judah Samet, guest of President Trump, looks on during the State of the Union address in the chamber of the U.S. House of Representatives on February 5, 2019 in Washington, DC. President Trump's second State of the Union address was postponed one week due to the partial government shutdown. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nA second Holocaust survivor who is here tonight, Joshua Kaufman, was a prisoner at Dachau Concentration Camp. He remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a cattle car as American soldiers rolled in with tanks. \"To me,\" Joshua recalls, \"the American soldiers were proof that God exists, and they came down from the sky.\"\n\nI began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on D-Day in the Second World War. One of them was Herman Zeitchik. But there is more to Herman's story. A year after he stormed the beaches of Normandy, Herman was one of those American soldiers who helped liberate Dachau. He was one of the Americans who helped rescue Joshua from that hell on earth. Almost 75 years later, Herman and Joshua are both together in the gallery tonight \u2014 seated side-by-side, here in the home of American freedom. Herman and Joshua: your presence this evening honors and uplifts our entire Nation.\n\nWhen American soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the English Channel in the early hours of D-Day, 1944, they were just young men of 18 and 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war.\n\nThey did not know if they would survive the hour. They did not know if they would grow old. But they knew that America had to prevail. Their cause was this Nation, and generations yet unborn.\n\nWhy did they do it? They did it for America \u2014 they did it for us.\n\nEverything that has come since \u2014 our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress toward equality and justice \u2014 all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the Americans who came before.\n\nThink of this Capitol \u2014 think of this very chamber, where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways, to defeat fascism, to secure civil rights, to face down an evil empire.\n\nHere tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent republic. You have come from the rocky shores of Maine and the volcanic peaks of Hawaii; from the snowy woods of Wisconsin and the red deserts of Arizona; from the green farms of Kentucky and the golden beaches of California. Together, we represent the most extraordinary Nation in all of history.\n\nWhat will we do with this moment? How will we be remembered? I ask the men and women of this Congress: Look at the opportunities before us! Our most thrilling achievements are still ahead. Our most exciting journeys still await. Our biggest victories are still to come. We have not yet begun to dream.\n\nWe must choose whether we are defined by our differences \u2014 or whether we dare to transcend them.\n\nWe must choose whether we will squander our inheritance \u2014 or whether we will proudly declare that we are Americans. We do the incredible. We defy the impossible. We conquer the unknown.\n\nThis is the time to re-ignite the American imagination. This is the time to search for the tallest summit, and set our sights on the brightest star. This is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots.\n\nThis is our future \u2014 our fate \u2014 and our choice to make. I am asking you to choose greatness.\n\nNo matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward together.\n\nWe must keep America first in our hearts. We must keep freedom alive in our souls. And we must always keep faith in America's destiny \u2014 that one Nation, under God, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world!\n\nThank you. God Bless You, God Bless America, and good night!\"\n\nWatch the full speech as Trump delivered it below:",

    "text": "A month into Venezuela\u2019s high-stakes political crisis, President Nicolas Maduro revealed in an Associated Press interview that his government held secret talks with the Trump administration and predicted he would survive an unprecedented global campaign to force his resignation.\n\nWhile harshly criticizing U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s confrontational stance toward his socialist government, Maduro said Thursday that he holds out hope of meeting the U.S. president soon to resolve a crisis triggered by America\u2019s recognition of opponent Juan Guaido as Venezuela\u2019s rightful leader.\n\nWATCH: Trump on Venezuela: \u2018We seek a peaceful transition of power but all options are open\u2019\n\nREAD MORE: Why Russia wants Nicolas Maduro to stay in charge of Venezuela\n\nMaduro said that during two hushed meetings in New York, his foreign minister invited the Washington-based special envoy for Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, to come to visit \u201cprivately, publicly or secretly.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he wants to meet, just tell me when, where and how and I\u2019ll be there,\u201d Maduro said without providing more details. He said both New York meetings lasted several hours.\n\nWATCH: Trump says U.S. was proud to be the first nation in the world to recognize President Guiado\n\nA senior administration official in Washington who was not authorized to speak publicly said U.S. officials were willing to meet with \u201cformer Venezuela officials, including Maduro himself, to discuss their exit plans.\u201d\n\nVenezuela is plunging deeper into a political chaos triggered by the U.S. demand that Maduro step down a month into a second presidential term that the U.S. and its allies in Latin America consider illegitimate. His opponent, the 35-year-old Guaido, burst onto the political stage in January in the first viable challenge in years to Maduro\u2019s hold on power.\n\nWATCH: Maduro compares Trump to KKK leader as Venezuelan crisis continues\n\nAs head of Congress, Guaido declared himself interim president on Jan. 23, saying he had a constitutional right to assume presidential powers from the \u201ctyrant\u201d Maduro. He has since garnered broad support, calling massive street protests and winning recognition from the U.S. and dozens of nations in Latin America and Europe who share his goal of removing Maduro.\n\nThe escalating crisis is taking place against a backdrop of economic and social turmoil that has led to severe shortages of food and medicine that have forced millions to flee the once-prosperous OPEC nation.\n\nWATCH: Trump to Maduro: \u2018Let your people go, set your country free\u2019\n\nREAD MORE: Venezuela\u2019s Nicolas Maduro facing a ticking clock, new ambassador suggests\n\nAbrams\u2019 appointment as special envoy last month signalled the Trump administration\u2019s determination to take a tougher line on Venezuela.\n\nThe hawkish former Republican diplomat was a major voice pushing for the ouster of Manuel Noriega in Panama in the 1980s and also was convicted for withholding information from the U.S. Congress during the infamous Iran-Contra affair. He also played a leading role in managing the U.S.\u2019s tepid response to a brief coup that toppled Hugo Chavez in Venezuela in 2002.\n\nTwo senior Venezuelan officials who were not authorized to discuss the meetings publicly said the two encounters between Abrams and Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza came at the request of the U.S.\n\nThe first one on Jan. 26 they described as hostile, with the U.S. envoy threatening Venezuela with the deployment of troops and chastising the Venezuelan government for allegedly being in league with Cuba, Russia and Hezbollah.\n\nWATCH: Venezuela\u2019s Guaido demands humanitarian aid be allowed to enter country\n\nWhen they met again this week, the atmosphere was less tense, even though the Feb. 11 encounter came four days after Abrams said the \u201ctime for dialogue with Maduro had long passed.\u201d During that meeting, Abrams insisted that severe U.S. sanctions would oust Maduro even if Venezuela\u2019s military stuck by him.\n\nAbrams gave no indication the U.S. was prepared to ease demands Maduro step down. Still, the Venezuelans saw the meetings as a sign there is room for discussion with the Americans despite the tough public rhetoric coming from Washington.\n\nAt turns conciliatory and combative, Maduro said all Venezuela needs to rebound is for Trump to remove his \u201cinfected hand\u201d from the country that sits atop the world\u2019s largest petroleum reserves.\n\nHe said U.S. sanctions on the oil industry are to blame for mounting hardships even though shortages and hyperinflation that economists say topped 1 million per cent long predates Trump\u2019s recent action.\n\nREAD MORE: Maduro oversees military exercises as pressure mounts on Venezuelan leader\n\n\u201cThe infected hand of Donald Trump is hurting Venezuela,\u201d Maduro said.\n\nThe sanctions effectively ban all oil purchases by the U.S., which had been Venezuela\u2019s biggest oil buyer until now. Maduro said he will make up for the sudden drop in revenue by targeting markets in Asia, especially India, where the head of state-run oil giant PDVSA was this week negotiating new oil sales.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been building a path to Asia for many years,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a successful route, every year they are buying larger volumes and amounts of oil.\u201d\n\nAt a petroleum conference in New Delhi, Venezuela\u2019s oil minister Manuel Quevedo suggested the country was open to a barter system with India to get around U.S. sanctions.\n\n\u201cWe do not have any barter system with Venezuela. Commercial considerations and related factors will determine the value of trade,\u201d India\u2019s Ministry of External Affairs spokesman Raveesh Kumar said in response to the Venezuelan officials\u2019 comments.\n\nWATCH: Mass protests in Venezuela as Maduro flexes political muscle\n\nMaduro also cited the continued support of China and especially Russia, which has been a major supplier of loans, weapons and oil investment over the years. He said that the antagonistic views taken by Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin runs the risk of converting the current crisis into a high-risk geopolitical fight between the U.S. and Russia that recalls some of the most-dangerous brinkmanship of the Cold War.\n\nAmid the mounting pressure at home and abroad, Maduro said he won\u2019t give up power as a way to defuse the standoff.\n\nHe also reiterated a refusal to allow humanitarian aid, calling boxes of U.S.-donated food and pediatric supplies sitting in a warehouse on the border in Colombia mere \u201ccrumbs\u201d after the U.S. administration froze billions of dollars in the nation\u2019s oil revenue and overseas assets.\n\n\u201cThey hang us, steal our money and then say \u2018here, grab these crumbs\u2019 and make a global show out of it,\u201d said Maduro.\n\nHis comments came hours after British billionaire Richard Branson announced in a video that he\u2019ll be hosting a concert in the Colombian border town of Cucuta in hopes of raising $100 million to buy humanitarian supplies for Venezuelans.\n\nWATCH: Canadians call on Venezuelan President Maduro to resign\n\n\u201cWith dignity we say \u2018No to the global show,\u201d\u2018 said Maduro. \u201cWhoever wants to help Venezuela is welcome, but we have enough capacity to pay for everything that we need.\u201d\n\nOpponents say the 56-year-old former bus driver has lost touch with his working-class roots, accusing him of ordering mass arrests and starving Venezuelans while he and regime insiders \u2013 including the top military brass \u2013 line their pockets through corruption.\n\nBut Maduro shrugged off the label of \u201cdictator,\u201d attributing it to an ideologically driven media campaign by the West to undermine the socialist revolution started by Chavez.\n\nHe said he won\u2019t resign, seeing his place in history alongside other Latin American leftists from Salvador Allende in Chile to Jacobo Arbenz in Guatemala who in decades past had been the target of U.S.-backed coups.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not afraid,\u201d he said, adding that even last year\u2019s attack on him with explosives-laden drones during a military ceremony didn\u2019t shake his resolve. \u201cI\u2019m only worried about the destiny of the fatherland and of our people, our boys and girls\u2026.this is what gives me energy.\u201d",

    "text": "Why is Russia defending Nicolas Maduro\u2018s claim to the presidency in Venezuela despite international pushback? Simply put, the South American country owes the Kremlin a lot of money and oil, experts say.\n\nMaduro is also an important ally for Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has built his reputation at home on his ability to project Russia\u2019s power into parts of the world where the Soviet Union once held sway.\n\nWATCH: Trudeau addressed the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela putting the blame entirely on \u201cbrutal dictator\u201d Nicolas Maduro\n\nREAD MORE: Here\u2019s what is happening in Venezuela \u2014 and how Canada is involved\n\nPutin would look weak in the eyes of the Russian people if he failed to defend one of his friends against the United States, according to Vladimir Rouvinski, who studies Russia at the Woodrow Wilson Center\u2019s Kennan Institute. That\u2019s why Russia is so concerned that Maduro\u2019s position is in jeopardy.\n\n\u201cIt will be a defeat \u2014 a defeat which will be extremely difficult to explain to the Russians,\u201d Rouvinski told Global News by phone from Colombia, where he also teaches political studies at Icesi University.\n\nMaduro visits Russia several times a year and is well-liked by Russia\u2019s elites, including Putin, Rouvinski says.\n\n\u201cIn Russia, where personal relationships are so important, I think this is a factor that is playing in favour of Maduro,\u201d Rouvinski said.\n\n\u201cThere will be a sense of personal loss (in Russia) if Maduro falls.\u201d\n\nThe United States, Canada and several countries in the European Union have stopped recognizing Maduro as president, amid concerns over his latest election win and the state of the Venezuelan economy. Maduro has presided over a devastating economic collapse in Venezuela, where hyperinflation has ruined its currency and millions have fled the country in search of a better life elsewhere.\n\nREAD MORE: Experts say U.S. military threat in Venezuela could help Maduro\n\nRussia, China, Turkey and Iran have steadfastly supported Maduro throughout the crisis.\n\nThe U.S. and its allies have thrown their support behind opposition leader Juan Guaido, whom they have recognized as interim president. They\u2019ve also hammered Maduro with heavy sanctions designed to cut off his access to the government\u2019s foreign investments.\n\nWATCH BELOW: Congress applauds Trump\u2019s stance on Venezuela\n\nHowever, Maduro still controls Venezuela\u2019s military, and he has refused to surrender the presidency while powerful allies like Russia have his back.\n\n\u201cWe view the attempt to usurp power in Venezuela as something that contradicts and violates the foundations and principles of international law,\u201d Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Jan. 24.\n\nApproximately 400 suspected mercenaries were dispatched to Venezuela that same week to protect Maduro from harm, Reuters reported. The mercenaries are associated with a group called Wagner, a private military contractor that employs more than a thousand former Russian soldiers. The shadowy group has reportedly fought for Russian interests in Syria and Ukraine, although the Kremlin describes them as unaffiliated volunteers.\n\nREAD MORE: How shadowy mercenaries cash in on Russia's wars\n\nHere\u2019s why Russia is so determined to prop up Maduro, even in the face of international efforts to topple him.\n\nVenezuela reminds Russia of the olden days\n\nVladimir Putin rose to power in 2000 by promising to restore Russia to its former glory, and part of that meant befriending the Soviet Union\u2019s former allies in Latin America. Putin set out to do just that, and cut several deals to equip those countries with Russian-made weapons, not American ones.\n\n\u201cHe needed Latin America to show that Russia is a global player, that it has global reach, and that it\u2019s back in Latin America,\u201d Rouvinski said.\n\nMost of Putin\u2019s old friends in the region are now gone, leaving Maduro and Venezuela as Russia\u2019s last major foothold in Latin America.\n\nWATCH BELOW: Intel chiefs say foreign influence in Venezuela likely to prolong instability\n\nRouvinski described Venezuela as an important Russian ally in the United States\u2019 backyard, much like Ukraine has become an American ally under the shadow of Russia. Putin looks strong by maintaining that friendship with Maduro, and he would look ineffective if Maduro fell.\n\n\u201cVenezuela is practically the only country left for Putin,\u201d Rouvinski said. \u201cIt is an attempt to do exactly what the United States did to Ukraine.\u201d\n\nRouvinski adds that Maduro has a lot of friends in Russia, and those friends will not abandon their Venezuelan ally.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying to support the Maduro government however they can,\u201d he said.\n\nMaduro owes Russia a lot of money\n\nRussia has reportedly poured more than $17 billion into Venezuela in loans and investments since 1999, according to reporting from The Associated Press. Venezuela has paid back much of that debt, but it still owes Russia approximately $3.15 billion.\n\nRussia and Venezuela agreed to a 10-year repayment plan for that debt in November 2017.\n\nWATCH BELOW: Mysterious plane linked to Venezuelan gold\n\nThe U.S. has tried to cut off Maduro\u2019s ability to repay that money by sanctioning the state-owned oil company, PDVSA. The sanctions are expected to cost Maduro $11 billion in lost export proceeds next year, and will block him from accessing PDVSA assets worth $7 billion, White House national security adviser John Bolton said last month.\n\nBut Maduro\u2019s opponents have accused him of trying to pay back his allies in other ways.\n\nWATCH BELOW: Russia declares U.S. sanctions against Venezuela \u2018illegal\u2019\n\nOpposition lawmaker Jose Guerra claimed last week that Maduro sent approximately 20 metric tons of gold to Russia aboard a mysterious passenger jet that paid an out-of-the-ordinary visit to Caracas on Jan. 28. The 400-seat Boeing 777 arrived directly from Moscow with no one on board except for its flight crew, sparking speculation as to its true purpose. It remained on the tarmac in Caracas for two days.\n\nGuerra accused Maduro of loading more than $800 million worth of gold onto the jet, citing unnamed sources in Venezuela\u2019s monetary authority. He said the gold would amount to 15 per cent of the reserves in Caracas, although his claims have not been independently verified.\n\nWATCH BELOW: Mysterious plane returns to Russia from Venezuela\n\nA bank in Portugal blocked Venezuela\u2019s attempt to transfer $1.2 billion to banks in Uruguay, lawmaker Carlos Paparoni said at a congressional session on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThis transaction has until now been halted, protecting the resources of all Venezuelans,\u201d Paparoni said.\n\nVenezuela is in the grips of an economic crisis, with many residents struggling to get their hands on basic necessities.\n\nA senior official told Reuters last week that Maduro plans to sell a total of 29 metric tons of gold to the United Arab Emirates by the end of February in exchange for cash. Twenty-nine tons of gold would be worth approximately $1.2 billion, based on current market prices.\n\nWATCH BELOW: Venezuelans line up outside currency exchange houses as Maduro reverses currency rate\n\nRussia acknowledged last week that Venezuela will likely have trouble meeting its repayment schedule.\n\n\u201cThere will probably be problems,\u201d Sergei Storchak, Russia\u2019s deputy finance minister, told reporters on Jan. 29.\n\n\u201cEverything now depends on the army, on the soldiers and how faithful they will be to their duty and oath. It is difficult.\u201d\n\nStorchak says Venezuela is due to make its next twice-yearly, interest-only payment of over $100 million at the end of March. It made its last payment in September.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s Russian rifle factory\n\nRussia has a lot of military entanglements with Venezuela, which it views as a strategic ally in the Western Hemisphere. Venezuela has bought more than $4 billion in weapons from Russia since 2005, including approximately 50 helicopters, 24 fighter jets and 100,000 Kalashnikov rifles.\n\nKalashnikov Concern, the Russian-based gun manufacturer behind the original AK-47, is slated to open a new rifle factory in Venezuela at the end of the year, according to Russia\u2019s Interfax news agency.\n\nThe factory would be the first-ever Kalashnikov manufacturer in the West, and is expected to produce tens of thousands of weapons for Russia every year.\n\n\u201cThis plant is of strategic importance for the independence of Venezuela and its armed forces,\u201d Venezuela\u2019s defence minister, General-in-Chief Vladimir Padrino Lopez, told Interfax in Moscow last April.\n\nREAD MORE: Maduro oversees military exercises as pressure mounts on Venezuelan leader\n\nThe project was originally announced in 2006 but delayed for over a decade due to corruption scandals and mismanagement.\n\nOil, oil and more oil\n\nVenezuela\u2019s state-run energy company, PDVSA, operates the largest underground oil reserves in the world, and Russia is heavily invested in maintaining access to those reserves. Rosneft, Russia\u2019s No. 1 oil producer, has loaned PDVSA billions and pre-purchased a vast amount of oil to help keep it afloat. Rosneft is also one of several foreign oil companies operating in Venezuela.\n\nPDVSA currently owes Rosneft $2.3 billion, the Russian oil company said on Tuesday. Rosneft says PDVSA made its last debt payment on time, reducing the amount owing by about $800 million.\n\nREAD MORE: U.S. issues lists of 210 Russian politicians, oligarchs linked to Putin\n\nAmerican sanctions aim to prevent PDVSA from exporting roughly 500,000 barrels of crude oil per day to the U.S., which is one of its primary customers. American refineries can buy the oil but the money gets locked away in an escrow account until Maduro is no longer in control of PDVSA.\n\nWATCH BELOW: U.S. will lift sanctions on Venezuela when Maduro is gone\n\nOil once fuelled Venezuela\u2019s economy, but that economy collapsed after oil prices dropped in recent years, plunging the country into its current crisis. Selling oil will be a crucial part of Maduro\u2019s efforts to pay back Russia and China, his other major creditor. Venezuela owes Beijing approximately $20 billion.\n\nRouvinski says Russia might be drawn into a military conflict if a pro-American leader takes over in Venezuela and seizes Russian oil assets, without providing any compensation. However, combat is the \u201cleast desirable option,\u201d because Russia is too far away to sustain a fight in Venezuela, he said.\n\n\u201cI believe this would be the last option,\u201d he said. \u201cRussia understands that it may end up with unpredictable results.\u201d\n\nHe adds that Russia doesn\u2019t want to be pushed into a corner, but it will react if things get too heated in Venezuela.\n\n\u201cFor them, the point of no return will be U.S. invasion.\u201d\n\n\u2014 With files from Reuters and The Associated Press",

    "text": "During the State of the Union on Tuesday, U.S. President Donald Trump intensified pressure on Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro, saying his socialist policies have damaged the country.\n\n\u201cWe condemn the brutality of the Maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in South America into a state of abject poverty and despair,\u201d Trump said.\n\nFACT CHECK: Trump boasts numbers that don\u2019t match official ones in State of the Union address\n\nOpposition leader Juan Guaido has deemed himself the country\u2019s interim president over Maduro on Jan. 23, after Maduro banned opponents from running in an election last year that has been condemned internationally as illegitimate.\n\nThe U.S., Canada and more than 30 other countries have now recognized Guaido as Venezuela\u2019s president. And Maduro is taking this as a threat, warning Venezuelans about an imminent invasion from the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. under Trump is not helping the situation in Venezuela,\u201d Nicol\u00e1s Sald\u00edas, a PhD candidate at the University of Toronto and researcher at the Wilson Center in Washington, D.C., said.\n\nWATCH: Aid arrives at Venezuela border with Colombia, but power struggle may prevent it from entering country\n\nSald\u00edas said the U.S.\u2019s threats of military intervention helps embattled leader Maduro, as it creates the perception the U.S. is going to pursue the option.\n\nMaxwell Cameron, a UBC political science professor, agreed.\n\n\u201cThere is a lot of truth to that. The U.S. sanctions allowed the Maduro government to blame the U.S. for economic mismanagement, and American coup-mongering justifies his [Maduro\u2019s] hard line in dealing with the opposition,\u201d Cameron said.\n\nWATCH: Puerto Rico\u2019s Secretary of State sending aid to Venezuela\n\nMaduro has accused the U.S. of \u201cwanting to return to the 20th century of military coups, subordinate puppet governments and the looting of resources.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, Maduro lashed out at Trump, saying he was obsessed with Venezuela because the U.S. wants to steal Venezuelan oil.\n\nWashington recently imposed sanctions on Venezuelan oil exports in an effort to undermine Maduro\u2019s main source of income and weaken his grip on power.\n\nWATCH: Congress applauds U.S. stance on Venezuela\n\nWill the U.S. invade Venezuela?\n\nTrump said U.S. military intervention was under consideration in an interview with CBS aired on Sunday.\n\n\u201cCertainly, it\u2019s something that\u2019s on the \u2014 it\u2019s an option,\u201d he said.\n\nREAD MORE: Maduro oversees military exercises as pressure mounts on Venezuelan leader\n\nOn Jan. 28, U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton also said that \u201call options are on the table,\u201d when it came to Venezuela but he did not specify what the next steps could be.\n\nHowever, a line scrawled on his notepad appeared to read, \u201c5,000 troops to Colombia.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Military intervention in Venezuela \u2018an option,\u2019 Trump says\n\nMaduro has previously accused Bolton and the U.S. of colluding with Colombia to try and assassinate him.\n\nIn a press conference in December, Maduro said the U.S. was using \u201cdirty dollars bled from the U.S. empire\u201d to train Colombian mercenaries to carry out the assassination, with the blessing of Colombian President Ivan Duque.\n\nHowever, the chances of the U.S. invading Venezuela are \u201cunlikely,\u201d Sald\u00edas said.\n\nWATCH: John Bolton\u2019s notes on Venezuela crisis raises eyebrows\n\nHe said it does not line up with Trump\u2019s foreign policy preferences, like pulling troops out of Syria and trying to get the U.S. out of Afghanistan. Trump also does not place a heavy emphasis on Latin America, he said.\n\n\u201cHe did not mention it in his State of the Union speech,\u201d he said, adding that Trump seems to have an anti-war stance, which goes against a massive U.S. invasion in Venezuela.\n\nWATCH: Nicolas Maduro asks Trump to \u2018stop\u2019 interfering in Venezuela\n\nHe believes the \u201call options are on the table\u201d threat is probably just a negotiating strategy to try and get the other side to bend and instill fear in Maduro.\n\nCameron said the possibility of a U.S. military intervention in Venezuela should be taken seriously, \u201cconsidering the military hardliners\u201d in U.S. office, such as Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.\n\n\u201cMost people believe this would be a disaster, as any use of force in Venezuela would make a situation that is already catastrophic, even worse,\u201d he said.\n\nMaduro may use U.S. threat to rally his base\n\nMaduro has always used the threat of U.S. intervention as a means to rally his base \u2014 just like former President Hugo Chavez did during his 14 years in power, Sald\u00edas said.\n\n\u201cThis is akin to Trump using the threat of the migrant caravan to build a wall,\u201d he added.\n\nVenezuela has the largest proven oil reserves in the world and Maduro has long accused the U.S. of wanting to take control of its vast riches.\n\nREAD MORE: Here\u2019s what is happening in Venezuela \u2014 and how Canada is involved\n\nMaduro is using fear-mongering to build his base, and Sald\u00edas said the U.S. threat of military intervention just feeds into the fire.\n\n\u201cHis base is very small, but they\u2019re armed. These people are parodying the same lines \u2026 saying the U.S. is going to invade.\u201d\n\nThe base Sald\u00edas is referring to is called the \u201ccolectivos\u201d or collectives, an organized militia group that has vowed to defend Maduro, according to the BBC.\n\nSald\u00edas believes a majority of Venezuelans probably do not think the U.S. is going to invade Venezuela. But the people who are \u201cdeep into the state media,\u201d like the \u201ccolectivos\u201d are already primed to thinking U.S. troops are coming.\n\n\u201cThe number of people who support him [Maduro] does not exceed 30 per cent of the population. But the people who do support him \u2026 they are hardcore,\u201d he said.\n\nWATCH: Venezuela\u2019s Guaido calls for humanitarian aid to be allowed into country\n\nHowever, Eric Farnsworth, a former U.S. diplomat and vice-president of the Council of the Americas, told the Guardian that Trump\u2019s swift recognition of Guaido was \u201ca clear inflexion point\u201d that could prove the tipping point for Maduro\u2019s embattled regime.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we can automatically assume he is on the way out. But I do think today is the most serious threat he has faced,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014 With files from Global News\u2019 Rahul Kalvapalle and the Associated Press",

Rodrigo Abd/The Associated Press\n\nTroops loyal to President Nicolas Maduro violently drove back foreign aid convoys from Venezuela\u2019s border on Saturday, killing two protesters and prompting opposition leader Juan Guaido to propose that Washington consider \u201call options\u201d to oust him.\n\nTrucks laden with U.S. food and medicine returned to warehouses in Colombia after opposition supporters failed to break through lines of troops, who dispersed them with tear gas and rubber rounds, injuring dozens. Witnesses said masked men in civilian clothes also shot at protesters with live bullets.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s events force me to make a decision: to formally propose to the international community that we must have all options open to secure the freedom of our country,\u201d Guaido said on Twitter.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe United States has been the top foreign backer of Guaido, who invoked Venezuela\u2019s constitution to assume an interim presidency last month and is now recognized by most Western nations as the OPEC nation\u2019s legitimate leader.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has in the past said military intervention in Venezuela was \u201can option,\u201d though Guaido made no reference to it on Saturday.\n\nGuaido had given a personal send-off to one convoy carrying aid from the Colombian city of Cucuta on Saturday.\n\nThe opposition had hoped Venezuelan soldiers would balk at turning back supplies desperately needed in the country, where a growing number of its 30 million people suffer from malnutrition and treatable diseases.\n\nBut while some 60 members of the security forces defected on Saturday, according to Colombian authorities, the lines of National Guard soldiers at the frontier crossings held firm, firing tear gas at the convoys.\n\nAt the Urena border point, two aid trucks caught fire, sending plumes of dark smoke into the air as crowds raced to try to save the boxes of supplies, a Reuters witness said.\n\nGuaido said he would keep demanding Maduro let the aid in and would seek other routes.

Washington has warned it could seek to impose tough new sanctions on Venezuela at Monday\u2019s summit if Maduro blocked the aid shipments.\n\n\u201cWhat do the Venezuelan people think of Donald Trump\u2019s threats?

    "text": "There was a time when Venezuela was one of the richest countries in the world \u2013 wealthier even than Canada.\n\nThe year was 1950. And oil-rich Venezuela was thriving, while much of the rest of the world was struggling to recover from the ravages of the Second World War. Only the United States, Switzerland and New Zealand had a higher per capita GDP. Canada ranked sixth.\n\nWith its relative stability and prosperity, Venezuela was a magnet for immigrants.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nToday it is an economic basket case. The country still has plenty of oil, sitting atop the world\u2019s largest reserves. But it is now a poor country, and its oil production is plunging.\n\nIn the nearly five years since Nicolas Maduro became president, its economy has shrunk in half. And economists warn that it is on course to decline by another 25 per cent this year, dragged down by recently imposed U.S. trade sanctions. Hunger, power blackouts, empty store shelves, rampant crime and hyperinflation have become part of everyday life.\n\nAs many as 3.3 million Venezuelans \u2013 more than 10 per cent of the population \u2013 have fled to neighbouring countries, as well as to the U.S. and Spain. Among the refugees are some of the most desperate, but also many of the country\u2019s best and brightest workers.\n\n\u201cVenezuela\u2019s economic collapse is almost unprecedented in recent history,\u201d according to a report this month by the Washington-based Institute for International Finance (IIF). Only Russia\u2019s implosion after the breakup of the Soviet Union comes close.\n\nThe central question now is how to make Venezuela whole again, when the Maduro regime inevitably cedes power, presumably to opposition leader Juan Guaido.\n\nUnfortunately, Mr. Maduro\u2019s exit \u2013 a change advocated by Canada, the U.S. and dozens of other countries \u2013 won\u2019t miraculously fix this badly broken country. It will take years and tens of billions of dollars in emergency loans and longer-term financial support from the international community, including the International Monetary Fund.\n\n\u201cThe depth of the recession raises the risk of an incomplete recovery in the event of policy change,\u201d the IIF warned.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe first challenge will be to get inflation under control. Prices are on course to rocket ahead at a staggering 1.3-million-per-cent pace this year, according to the IMF. Money has essentially lost its value.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Experts say a large and quick infusion of foreign cash would allow the government to keep operations running and to buy more local currency, the bolivar. The government could then fund its deficit in local currency without resorting to printing money with reckless abandon, as it does now.\n\nGetting the economy growing again could prove more challenging in a country that no longer has a viable private sector. Mr. Maduro and his predecessor Hugo Ch\u00e1vez expropriated vast swaths of the economy \u2013 from banks and telecoms to factories and hotels. And the businesses the government didn\u2019t take, it killed with strict controls on prices, foreign exchange and imports.\n\nVenezuela will also have to work hard to make the country a welcome place again for private investors, and for millions of exiles. That will require ending price controls, relaxing import curbs, enforcing property rights and reopening access to foreign currency markets. Another key precondition for kick-starting private businesses will be to get commercial banks lending again.\u200b\n\nPutting the government on a sustainable financial footing will take more time. A good start would be to cut military spending and phase out massive subsidies for consumers for buying gas and electricity. Many Venezuelans may also need wage supports to adjust to higher prices for some of these necessities.\n\nThe oil sector must become a driver of foreign investment again. That means ending the practice of forcing foreign investors to work exclusively with the country\u2019s state-run oil company \u2013 Petroleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nVenezuela has become increasingly oil dependent, even as the price of crude has slumped and production dwindled. Oil exports bring in about 90 per cent of the country\u2019s hard currency. Beyond people, oil is virtually the only thing the country still exports. But it\u2019s producing less oil now than it did in the late 1990s, and output has fallen by half in just the past two years from lack of investment.\n\nIn the short term, the new U.S. sanctions will make the situation worse by cutting off billions of dollars in oil revenue and blocking imports of the U.S.-made refined products it needs to dilute the heavy crude it produces.\n\nAnother challenge for whomever succeeds Mr. Maduro will be to keep onside China and Russia, two of Venezuela\u2019s largest foreign creditors.\n\nThe sooner Venezuela gets the rebuilding started, the better.",
