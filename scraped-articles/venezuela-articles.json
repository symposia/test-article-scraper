    "title": "Opinion | Venezuela: Between Maduro and a Hard Place",
    "text": "Venezuela\u2019s political and economic crisis took a fateful turn on Wednesday when the 35-year-old head of the National Assembly, Juan Guaid\u00f3, declared himself interim president and was promptly recognized by the United States, Canada, the Organization of American States and most Latin American governments. A mass demonstration called by Mr. Guaid\u00f3 brought out throngs waving flags and chanting, \u201cGet out, Maduro!\u201d\n\nBut the embattled incumbent, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, defiantly stood his ground, railing against \u201ccoups\u201d and \u201cgringo interventions,\u201d cutting ties with the United States and urging the armed forces to stand with him. Russia, Mr. Maduro\u2019s ally and benefactor, weighed in with blistering warnings to the United States against any intervention. The Venezuelan defense minister declared that the armed forces, long a bastion of support for Mr. Maduro, remained behind him, but much depends on whether the rank and file will follow.\n\nThat Mr. Maduro must go has been obvious for some time. Since he succeeded the leftist strongman Hugo Ch\u00e1vez in 2013, his mismanagement, cronyism and corruption, exacerbated by the drop in the price of oil, Venezuela\u2019s dominant source of revenue, have brought the country to ruin. Hyperinflation has rendered wages virtually worthless, people are dying of starvation and lack of medical care, and millions have fled to neighboring countries.\n\nThe question has been how to pry Mr. Maduro out without a blood bath. Mr. Maduro, with the opposition divided and the armed forces behind him, tenaciously clung to power, largely blaming a hostile United States for the country\u2019s woes. He packed the Supreme Court with allies, created a parallel legislature, suppressed mass demonstrations by force and orchestrated his own re-election last May."

    "text": "Maduro offers an olive branch, while his police crack the whip\n\nAs protests broke out in Venezuela again, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro said he was open to sitting down with the opposition, but it was unclear whether the offer was genuine or just a delaying tactic.\n\nIn an interview with a Russian news agency, Mr. Maduro also rejected calls for a new election. His re-election last year has been widely disputed, and the U.S. and a number of European countries have called for a fresh vote.\n\nIn a video, Mr. Maduro warned the U.S. that military intervention in his country \u201cwould lead to a Vietnam worse than they can imagine.\u201d\n\nBackground: Over the last week, Juan Guaid\u00f3, the leader of the opposition, has received growing recognition around the world as interim president. The U.S., in an effort to oust Mr. Maduro, has imposed harsh oil sanctions that economists worry could unravel a Venezuelan economy already in vertiginous decline.\n\nOn the streets: Mr. Maduro has hit back viciously, human rights groups and others say, dispatching security forces to crush dissent in poor neighborhoods that have turned on his government. The deadly operations have alarmed even some of the president\u2019s traditional supporters. And his reliance on a special police unit \u2014 relatively new and shrouded in secrecy \u2014 may be a sign of disarray and waning loyalty in the military."

Mr. Maduro\u2019s re-election last year was marred by reports of widespread coercion and fraud.\n\nMr. Arreaza, the foreign minister, scoffed at the ultimatum.\n\n\u201cEurope is giving us eight days? What gives you the right?\u201d Mr. Arreaza demanded during a session of the United Nations Security Council.\n\nMr. Maduro continued to strike a defiant tone on Saturday, writing on Twitter that his government \u201cwould not rest until we defeat the attempted coup\u201d orchestrated by people who want to establish a \u201cpuppet government of the United States empire.\u201d\n\nBut his government appears to have decided for the time being not to detain Mr. Guaid\u00f3 or disrupt his political rallies as support for the 35-year-old opposition leader has grown at home and abroad. Mr. Guaid\u00f3 proclaimed himself the legitimate head of the executive branch on Wednesday as his supporters took to the streets in droves.\n\nHe argued that the presidency became technically vacant on Jan. 10, when Mr. Maduro was sworn in for a new term after an election widely seen as rigged. The country\u2019s Constitution says that the president of the National Assembly, Mr. Guaid\u00f3 in this case, becomes interim leader if the presidency is vacated.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s Foreign Ministry and the State Department did not respond to a request for information about the status of Venezuelan diplomats. It was unclear how many have pledged allegiance to Mr. Guaid\u00f3 and whether they would remain accredited as diplomats in the United States.\n\nAt least one official, the country\u2019s military attach\u00e9 in Washington, Col. Jos\u00e9 Luis Silva, said in an interview with The Nuevo Herald that he no longer recognized Mr. Maduro as president."

On the other is the opposition led by Juan Guaid\u00f3, the 35-year-old National Assembly leader who declared himself interim president last month during a mass demonstration against the government. At least seven European countries threw their weight behind Mr. Guaid\u00f3 on Monday, raising pressure on Mr. Maduro.\n\nThe crisis, years in the making, has left many of Venezuela\u2019s roughly 31 million people destitute and hungry, sent more than two million people into neighboring countries as refugees and created a new source of instability in Latin America. The outcome of the struggle will determine who controls not only Venezuela\u2019s government but also its proven oil reserves, which by some estimates are the world\u2019s largest.\n\nHere are the basics on who is with Mr. Maduro, who has turned against him \u2014 and what to expect in the next turbulent weeks:\n\nMr. Maduro still has powerful backers at home and abroad.\n\nRussia in particular has propped up Mr. Maduro\u2019s government with billions of dollars in loans, and Cuba has provided intelligence support. While Venezuela\u2019s poorest people may be suffering the most as the economy stagnates and institutions crumble, many remain loyal to Mr. Maduro as the heir to Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, the longtime socialist leader who commanded an enormous following.

He fields the calls from world leaders, as well as diplomats and Venezuelan politicians, on a cellphone that gets a torrent of text messages, and his phone\u2019s battery seems always on the verge of dying.\n\nIf his sudden rise has been overwhelming, Mr. Guaid\u00f3 shows no sign of feeling frazzled. His demeanor is calm as a volunteer team of aides dart around him frantically. The only outward sign that this tumultuous new life is getting to Mr. Guaid\u00f3 is the hoarseness in his voice. At night, when he stops taking calls and visits, Mr. Guaid\u00f3 said, he has no trouble falling asleep.\n\n\u201cI sleep placidly,\u201d Mr. Guaid\u00f3 said in an interview as his car stealthily moved through Caracas traffic, adding that he had learned to sleep soundly under trying conditions when he and other opposition leaders staged a 15-day hunger strike in 2015, sleeping on cots on the street, to pressure the government to set a date for legislative elections. \u201cIt\u2019s an advantage.\u201d\n\nBut Mr. Guaid\u00f3 realizes the path he\u2019s on is full of hazards.\n\nOpposition leaders had hoped that when Mr. Guaid\u00f3 proclaimed himself the country\u2019s legitimate leader at a huge street rally, the chiefs of the armed forces would turn on Mr. Maduro in short order. While there have been a handful of high-profile defections, the top military brass has publicly rallied behind Mr. Maduro, which may portend a protracted standoff.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing progress, but it\u2019s not happening as quickly as we\u2019d like,\u201d Mr. Guaid\u00f3 said, adding that fear remains a strong impediment, particularly among low-level troops who support what the opposition is doing.\n\nIndeed, Mr. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s success is far from guaranteed. Mr. Maduro still holds many of the levers of power, including the state broadcaster, a compliant judiciary, the country\u2019s military leaders and ruthless paramilitary forces known as colectivos."

It is incumbent on us to reinstate normality, in order to build the advanced and prosperous country of which we all dream.\n\nBut first we must recover our freedom.\n\nThe struggle for freedom has been part of our DNA ever since independence was achieved in Latin America 200 years ago. In this century we have taken to the streets repeatedly, knowing that not only is the survival of our democracy at stake, but the very fate of our nation.\n\nA pattern has developed under the Maduro regime . When pressure builds, the first recourse is to repress and persecute. I know this because buckshot pellets fired by members of the armed forces \u2014 at peaceful protesters in 2017 \u2014 remain lodged in my own body. A minor price to pay compared to the sacrifices made by some of my compatriots.\n\nUnder Mr. Maduro at least 240 Venezuelans have been murdered at marches, and there are 600 political prisoners, including the founder of my party, Leopoldo L\u00f3pez, who has been a prisoner for five years. When repressive tactics prove futile, Mr. Maduro and his henchmen disingenuously propose \u201cdialogue.\u201d But we have become immune to such manipulation. There are no more stunts left for them to pull. The usurpation of power was their only remaining option.\n\nGiven that the Maduro regime cannot legitimately retain power, our response is threefold: First, to shore up the National Assembly as the last bastion of democracy; second, to consolidate the support of the international community, especially the Lima Group, the Organization of American States, the United States and the European Union; and third, to address the people, on the basis that they have a right to self-determination.\n\nOver 50 countries have recognized either me as interim president or the National Assembly as the legitimate authority in Venezuela. I have appealed to Ant\u00f3nio Guterres, the United Nations Secretary General, as well as to several humanitarian agencies, for support in easing the humanitarian crisis. I have begun the process of appointing ambassadors and locating and recovering national assets tied up abroad.\n\nThere is a broad consensus among Venezuelans in favor of change: 84 percent of our people reject Mr. Maduro\u2019s rule. We have, therefore, been holding town halls across the country so people can talk openly about the moment in which we find ourselves, and about our future ."

Even now, companies like Chevron and Halliburton continue to operate in the country. Before sanctions announced last week on the state-owned oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, or PDVSA, Venezuela received as much as $8 of every $10 in oil sales from the United States. The reality is that Venezuela depends on the United States far more than the other way around.\n\nSome claim democracy has driven the Trump administration to intervene. But when President Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez of Honduras stole the election in 2017, the United States offered him full support. Likewise, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo tacitly backed Guatemala\u2019s president, Jimmy Morales, as he quashed a United Nations-mandated anticorruption commission, Cicig, in a move widely seen as antidemocratic. And anyone who claims to promote democracy and human rights would condemn the appointment of Elliott Abrams as special envoy to Venezuela. His involvement in covert operations and support for death squads in Central America in the 1980s has been well documented.\n\nIf not oil or democracy, what, then, drives United States officials\u2019 outsize push to oust the Chavismo leadership, and with what larger implications for Venezuela and Latin America? For the United States, regime change in Venezuela means reclaiming leadership over its \u201cbackyard,\u201d as then-Secretary of State John Kerry characterized Latin America in 2013, after nearly 20 years of marginalization.\n\nMr. Ch\u00e1vez was first sworn in as president on Feb. 2, 1999. He was swept into office partly by promising to reverse United States-led austerity, free trade and privatization policies that brought inequality and poverty to millions across the region. As Mr. Ch\u00e1vez spotlighted their suffering, he helped to usher in a new crop of leaders regionally willing to assert greater political independence from the United States.\n\nAs left-wing governments won office across Latin America, they used the spike in commodity prices to distribute wealth and lower poverty. They also formed strategic partnerships to counter United States influence in hemispheric affairs, opening up relations and major investment with then-booming China and Russia. When Brazil helped scuttle the Free Trade Area of the Americas in 2005, it proved that the era of overriding United States influence in the region was over. Washington had lost the ability to set the agenda."

The National Assembly, which is the only democratically elected institution remaining in the country, was right to designate Juan Guaid\u00f3 as Venezuela\u2019s interim president. Questioning his legitimacy is tantamount to questioning democracy. It is a mind-boggling paradox, indeed. Mr. Maduro\u2019s opposition is demanding that he comply with the Bolivarian Constitution established during Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s leadership, and Mr. Maduro is violating it at every turn.\n\nWe now have an opportunity to restore democracy in Venezuela. This will not be an easy task. Mr. Maduro wields the power of weapons, while the National Assembly has legitimacy, but lacks the influence and authority that come from its government institutions. How can this impossible imbalance be corrected?\n\nFirst, with solid, unflinching unity. The democratic countries that have recognized Mr. Guaid\u00f3 must reinforce his political legitimacy as well as his authority over Venezuela\u2019s economic assets, both in and out of the country. This will cut off Mr. Maduro\u2019s access to the resources he uses to oppress the Venezuelan people, and will communicate very clearly to his supporters (particularly those in the military) that endorsing him is a dead end.\n\nSecond, the conflict must be guided back to its original, regional scale. Venezuela must not become yet another front in the newfangled mini Cold War that the United States and Russia have been waging in places like Ukraine and Syria. The United States, Russia and China must avoid using Venezuela as a proxy in a geopolitical power struggle. By not interfering they can prevent a stalemate that could give Mr. Maduro time and resources to cling to power.\n\nManagement of the Venezuelan crisis should be left in the hands of key regional stakeholders. The European Union, with the support of Canada, should create the space and conditions so that the Lima Group, which comprises 14 countries from the Americas, may decide a course of action. They should recruit the Mexican president, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, to support the cause of democracy in Venezuela, and make the Cuban regime understand that it cannot continue to intervene in Venezuela and leech off its resources."

    "text": "By late 2017, the inflation rate exceeded 50 percent a month. It was a turning point: economists signaled that we were officially in hyperinflation. Inflation is bad, but hyperinflation is a totally different game.\n\nHyperinflation hits the poorest the hardest. Venezuelans have reported losing on average 24 pounds in body weight. Nearly 90 percent now live in poverty. In the slums of Caracas, I visited mothers who have gone from reducing their children\u2019s portions to having them skip meals altogether.\n\nMarilyn Alma, a mother of three, had to give up custody of her eldest child because she can no longer feed him. One week, a dozen eggs cost Alba three days of wages; the next week, the cost doubles. Eggs, the cheapest source of protein, are now a distant dream for the vast majority of people. Ms. Alma, who had once been a staunch government supporter, told me, \u201cMaduro betrayed this country.\u201d\n\nThe professional class has also been affected. In middle-class neighborhoods large supermarkets previously stocked with imported goods are now half stocked with cheaper versions. Professionals can only afford two or three food items, and retirees often must leave behind products they can no longer afford. Their life savings and pensions are suddenly worthless.\n\nHyperinflation has also meant a brain drain. Young engineers or doctors are now working as waiters in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia, or as store clerks in Lima, Peru. \u201cThe worst part is that they send back money to help us,\u201d Melani Delgado, whose two sons have left, told me recently as she fought back tears. A part-time dentist, Delgado said she could once afford to send her children to private university on her salary. Today remittances are fast becoming a lifeline for those left behind. \u201cThis government broke up the Venezuelan family and turned parents into parasites,\u201d she said.\n\nIf you belong to the dwindling minority that has access to dollars, you can somewhat offset the rise in prices with the surge in the black-market exchange. You may be able to survive, but it\u2019s impossible to plan for something that changes every day. To adapt to the destruction all around you.\n\nFor those with access to dollars, living with hyperinflation is demoralizing. At 6,000 bol\u00edvars (the equivalent of $2, or one third of the minimum monthly wage ), a pound of butter is obscenely expensive. Paying $30 for a 17-ounce bottle of olive oil feels criminal. Today this bottle costs the equivalent of five times the minimum wage, but that\u2019s likely to change tomorrow. \u201cBeating the system\u201d feels like you are eviscerating your country\u2019s economy."

By commandeering Venezuela\u2019s only lifeline to food supplies and oil field equipment, the United States has lit the fuse. By the Trump administration\u2019s own estimates, sanctions will cost Venezuela\u2019s economy $11 billion in lost oil revenue in the next year , which is equal to 94 percent of what the country spent last year in goods imports.

We start from the proposition that the people of Venezuela should not be the victims of a power struggle between Mr. Maduro and the opposition, nor between the external backers of the two sides.\n\nAs much as Mr. Maduro\u2019s foes hate to admit, and indeed find repellent, Chavismo still carries some political weight in the society and among the military. We therefore recommend a compromise solution rather than a fight to the finish. One of us recently wrote about a key historical case \u2014 Poland in 1989 \u2014 where two bitter foes, the existing Communist regime and the opposition Solidarity movement, agreed to cohabit in the government for a two-year transition period until future presidential elections. Leaders in both the government and opposition in Venezuela have expressed interest in negotiations, yet each side is also being encouraged by outside allies to ride out the struggle without compromise.\n\nNone of the foregoing is meant to excuse or deny the atrocious mismanagement of the country by the government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, nor the serious evidence of multiple and systematic human rights violations by his forces. Yet we do not need to let the justifiable outrage at these abuses lead us blindly into a protracted conflict that could only increase the suffering of Venezuelans. What we need is an understanding that negotiation and compromise are key to a peaceful solution."

    "title": "Opinion | Can Venezuela Have a Peaceful Transition?",
    "text": "Just weeks ago, there was virtually no hope that Venezuela\u2019s economic and humanitarian crisis would soon be eased. President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro seemed to face no serious challenge to his increasingly repressive and corrupt rule. Despite some discontent in the armed forces, high-level officers appeared to stand with him. Today, with the appearance of a credible rival to Mr. Maduro, Venezuela\u2019s future hinges on those very same officers.\n\nUntil now, Mr. Maduro has been particularly lucky that his political foes have been unable to cohere into an effective resistance with a clear strategy and forceful leadership. His opponents\u2019 weakness was in part the result of repeated government crackdowns that instilled widespread fear. But on Wednesday it was evident that Mr. Maduro\u2019s luck had run out and that void was being filled in dramatic fashion by a relatively unknown leader who declared himself the country\u2019s legitimate president before thousands of supporters in Caracas.\n\nHis name is Juan Guaid\u00f3, and he is the 35-year-old president of the National Assembly who led the broad-based nationwide protests that demonstrated ordinary Venezuelans\u2019 anger over Mr. Maduro\u2019s rule. Mr. Guaid\u00f3, who was elected the assembly\u2019s president only a few weeks ago, has been largely untainted by Venezuela\u2019s tired political squabbles.\n\nHis messaging stands in sharp contrast to that of previous opposition figures, who castigated Mr. Maduro and, before him, President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, and were unable to connect with Venezuelans who approved of Mr. Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s left-leaning policies. Strikingly, the rally on Wednesday featured protesters from across the socioeconomic spectrum, including some from areas that had once been Chavista strongholds. They seemed to be drawn to Mr. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s refreshing style and vision of taking the country forward and not returning to the pre-Ch\u00e1vez era, an elite-dominated period of social inequality and economic collapse."

    "text": "Though Venezuelan generals appear to be backing Mr. Maduro, a handful of Venezuelan diplomats and officials posted to missions in the United States have said they are abandoning the Maduro government to support Mr. Guaid\u00f3. On Monday, Scarlett Salazar, a veteran diplomat based in Miami, where there is a large anti-Maduro Venezuelan population, announced she was siding with Mr. Guaid\u00f3.\n\nMost Latin American countries have recognized Mr. Guaid\u00f3 and demanded that Mr. Maduro acquiesce to the call for new elections. Several European nations also joined the call for elections after Mr. Pompeo held a meeting with representatives of the United Nations Security Council in New York on Saturday.\n\nThe campaign by the Trump administration has gotten a high level of bipartisan support among lawmakers in Washington, though some Democratic legislators have expressed concern about how hard-line policies might affect ordinary Venezuelans, who are already suffering from years of economic collapse. Others have asked whether the administration has a coherent strategy if Mr. Maduro clings to power.\n\nOn Monday, the United States put into effect what is essentially an embargo on oil from the main Venezuelan state-owned oil company, Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela, or Pdvsa. The sanctions would prevent most American companies from doing business with Pdvsa. Any money going to Pdvsa \u2014 including from its United States subsidiary, Citgo \u2014 would be put into accounts that could be used by what the Trump administration deems to be the legitimate Venezuelan government. For now, that is Mr. Guaid\u00f3 and the National Assembly, where the 35-year-old political activist and industrial engineer serves as leader.\n\nThe oil sanctions amount to the first punitive action taken by the United States against Mr. Maduro since the power struggle in Caracas erupted last week, and it is intended to starve the government of Mr. Maduro of cash and foreign currency. Oil production in Venezuela has already plummeted because of mismanagement and poor policies, and the country\u2019s economy is in shambles. Extraction at oil fields still takes place, though, and until now the country exported much of its crude oil to the United States to be refined and then sold.\n\nVenezuela also uses its oil to pay off debt held by China and Russia, and it does not get cash in return for those exports. Russia has denounced United States policy on Venezuela, while China has expressed concern but been more circumspect."

Administration officials said the financial penalties are expected to block $7 billion in assets and result in $11 billion in export losses over the next year for Venezuela\u2019s government, starving it from its most important source of revenue and foreign currency.\n\nLast week, the Trump administration recognized Mr. Guaid\u00f3, the 35-year-old leader of the National Assembly, as his supporters took to the streets to demand new elections.

China and Russia, which still support the Maduro government, are no less interested in profiting from Venezuela\u2019s oil than the United States.\n\nIt is as yet unclear how directly the United States shaped Mr. Guaid\u00f3\u2019s decision to challenge Mr. Maduro\u2019s authority. In December, he met secretly with officials in the United States, Colombia and Brazil, all governed by right-wing governments. But what is clear is that support for Mr. Guaid\u00f3 \u2014 or at least for an alternative to Mr. Maduro \u2014 extends beyond the right. Mr. Guaid\u00f3 was recognized as interim president by most members of the Lima Group \u2014 including Peru, Canada, Ecuador and Argentina \u2014 a body formed in 2017 to seek a peaceful resolution to the Venezuelan crisis.\n\nEven if Mr. Guaid\u00f3 did coordinate his declaration with the United States, the popular discontent that he channels is real. Many Venezuelans are eager to find help wherever they can, even if that means a Trump administration that is hardly known for its hostility to dictatorship or its commitment to human rights.\n\nThis is a vulnerability for the opposition. Washington is all too ready to lend a hand, but in doing so it could \u2014 as it has so many times in Latin America\u2019s history \u2014 cause more harm than good.\n\nMr. Maduro will use United States intervention to rally his remaining domestic and internal support under an anti-imperialist banner, drawing parallels with Washington\u2019s long history in the region. United States intervention would also undermine the prospect for the thing that Venezuela needs most to achieve a peaceful transition to democracy: national reconciliation. A government that owes a debt to Mr. Bolton and Mr. Abrams will not only be viewed with suspicion by many on the left in Venezuela; it could be forced to abide by constraints imposed by the neoconservatives in Washington about which political actors are considered acceptable partners in a reconciliation process.\n\nThe situation in Venezuela is, undoubtedly, difficult. But when it comes to Latin America, Washington has a long history of making difficult situations worse. It is precisely because Venezuela deserves a better government than it currently has that the United States should not play a role in choosing it.\n\nPatrick Iber is a professor of history at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.

[AUDIO PLAYBACK] ARCHIVED RECORDING (PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH): When decisions are hard and courage is needed.\n\narchived recording (president barack obama) I believe we can, and I believe we must. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmark landler Each of them approached the situation in different ways. And in each case, it provided a sort of a telling glimpse, a blueprint for how they were going to behave over the coming two years of their presidencies. [AUDIO PLAYBACK] ARCHIVED RECORDING (PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH): And this is the business before us tonight.\n\narchived recording (president barack obama) That\u2019s what the people who sent us here expect of us.\n\narchived recording (president bill clinton) Well, my fellow Americans, that\u2019s my agenda for America\u2019s future. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmichael barbaro So take us through the examples of these last three presidents who have given these speeches after they lost a midterm election. How have they approached the speech?\n\nmark landler Well, let\u2019s start with Bill Clinton. Bill Clinton gave his State of the Union address in January 1995 \u2014 [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording Democrats lost the House, they lost the Senate. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmark landler Three months after his party suffered a devastating defeat in the midterm elections. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording The Democratic chairman David Wilhelm said, simply, we got our butts kicked. Not one incumbent Republican lost. The anti-Clinton tide was fueled largely by frustration. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmark landler Time Magazine put him on the cover under the headline \u201cThe Incredible Shrinking President.\u201d Journalists even asked him whether he was still relevant anymore. And so this relatively young, untested president was dealt a very serious blow. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording Mr. Speaker, the president of the United States. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmark landler And he really came into his State of the Union address acknowledging that fact. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording (president bill clinton) If we agree on nothing else tonight, we must agree that the American people certainly voted for change in 1992 and in 1994. As I look out at you, I know how some of you must have felt in 1992. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmark landler Bill Clinton took a very contrite tone. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording (president bill clinton) In this effort, I am trying to say that I have made my mistakes. And I have learned, again, the importance of humility in all human endeavor. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmark landler So this was a president who admitted that he had screwed up and he pledged to learn from this experience. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording (president bill clinton) I think we all agree that we have to change the way the government works. Let\u2019s make it smaller, less costly and smarter\u2014 leaner and not meaner. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmark landler And even more than that, he pledged to take seriously the message that this incoming Republican majority brought with it. He acknowledged that, to some extent, the era of big government was over. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording (president bill clinton) And we\u2019re working on getting rid of unnecessary regulations and making them more sensible. The programs and regulations that have outlived their usefulness should go. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmark landler Bill Kristol, a conservative commentator, commented after this speech was given that it was the most conservative State of the Union address any Democratic president had ever delivered. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording (president bill clinton) This is a very, very great country. And our best days are still to come. Thank you, and God bless you all. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmichael barbaro So how much did Clinton\u2019s message at this State of the Union\u2014 this conciliatory tone, these promises of bipartisanship and an acknowledgment of this conservative agenda\u2014 how much did it predict how he was going to govern for the next two years?\n\nmark landler So, in fact, Bill Clinton did adjust. He did govern more as a centrist. He did pursue policies where he tried to find some common ground. And in the end, by moving toward his opponents, he wound up being very successful. And two years later, he was re-elected by a comfortable margin over his Republican opponent, Bob Dole. And Newt Gingrich, his antagonist\u2014 the man who sat behind him that night at the speech\u2014 wound up being the wounded figure, because he had gone to war with President Clinton over a government shutdown, and he ended up shouldering the blame, not Clinton. In other words, the State of the Union actually showed that this was a president who was learning on the job, who was willing to adjust course, and came out of it victorious. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording Washington turned upside down. The Democrats in, Rumsfeld out\u2014 tonight on \u201cWashington Week.\u201d ARCHIVED RECORDING (PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH): If you look at race by race, it was close. The cumulative effect, however, was not too close. It was a thumping. Even the president could not find a silver lining this time. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmark landler Twelve years later, Bill Clinton\u2019s successor, George W. Bush, found himself in a very similar situation. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording Republicans licked their wounds. Don Rumsfeld lost his job. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmark landler The Iraq War has gone very badly. He\u2019s been widely condemned for his handling of Hurricane Katrina. And in the midterm elections of 2006, the voters deliver a brutal message. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording I think you could say the driving force was that old refrain, \u201cI\u2019m mad as hell, and I\u2019m not going to take it anymore.\u201d And that\u2019s what we heard. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmark landler They send Congress back into the control of the Democrats. And President Bush turns up for his State of the Union address. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording (speaker nancy pelosi) The president of the United States. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmark landler Facing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. [AUDIO PLAYBACK] ARCHIVED RECORDING (PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH): And tonight, I have the high privilege and distinct honor of my own as the first president to begin the State of the Union message with these words: Madame Speaker. [END PLAYBACK] He\u2019s extremely gracious to her. He congratulates her. He refers to her father, who was a Democratic lawmaker from Baltimore, and the pride he would have felt if he had seen his daughter presiding in the chamber that night. [AUDIO PLAYBACK] ARCHIVED RECORDING (PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH): But nothing could compare with the sight of his only daughter, Nancy. [END PLAYBACK] And then he delivers a speech. [AUDIO PLAYBACK] ARCHIVED RECORDING (PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH): Some in this chamber are new to the House and the Senate, and I congratulate the Democrat majority. [END PLAYBACK] Where he takes account of the bitterness that Iraq has caused and the opposition that it has stirred up. [AUDIO PLAYBACK] ARCHIVED RECORDING (PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH): With the distance of time, we find ourselves debating the causes of conflict and the course we have followed. [END PLAYBACK] Not just among Democrats, but among members of his own party. [AUDIO PLAYBACK] ARCHIVED RECORDING (PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH): I\u2019ve spoken with many of you in person. I respect you and the arguments you\u2019ve made. We went into this largely united in our assumptions and in our convictions. And whatever you voted for, you did not vote for failure. [END PLAYBACK] And he, in effect, pleads for more time. He says that in this difficult situation, he and his military advisers have decided on a troop surge. [AUDIO PLAYBACK] ARCHIVED RECORDING (PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH): So we\u2019re deploying reinforcements of more than 20,000 additional soldiers and Marines to Iraq. [END PLAYBACK] And he basically asks for time to get this war right. [AUDIO PLAYBACK] ARCHIVED RECORDING (PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH): Our country is pursuing a new strategy in Iraq, and I ask you to give it a chance to work. And I ask you to support our troops in the field and those on their way. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmichael barbaro So President Bush uses this speech to acknowledge the unhappiness in the country. But unlike Clinton after the midterms, he doesn\u2019t change his approach. In fact, he leans into it and doubles down on it when it comes to the war in Iraq. [AUDIO PLAYBACK] ARCHIVED RECORDING (PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH): Our cause in the world is right. And tonight, that cause goes on. God bless. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmark landler And he also sticks to it afterward. So this speech is a very accurate blueprint for what the rest of the Bush presidency looks like. He does send the troops, they wind up having more success than many of the critics expected, and this becomes the way the United States winds down the war in Iraq. He really lays out the end game in Iraq in this State of the Union address. It actually proves to be a very, very accurate predictor of how things play out. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording Right now, we\u2019re looking at a live picture of the U.S. Capitol, where the Republicans will seize control of the House of Representatives. Picking up more than 60 seats now. Ohio\u2019s John Boehner now stands to become the next speaker, replacing Nancy Pelosi. He already got a call. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmark landler And then came President Obama, who spoke before Congress in January 2011, three months after his party lost control of Congress. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording The American people have sent an unmistakable message to him tonight, and that message is\u2014 change course. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmark landler And left this young president very much on his back foot. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording (president barack obama) Tonight, I want to begin by congratulating the men and women of the 112th Congress as well as your new speaker, John Boehner. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmichael barbaro And how did Obama\u2019s State of the Union confront that?\n\nmark landler Well, Obama responds to this setback, to this defeat, not by being contrite or acknowledging error. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording (president barack obama) For the challenges we face are bigger than party, bigger than politics. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmark landler But by, in effect, pushing past it. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording (president barack obama) At stake right now is not who wins the next election\u2014 after all, we just had an election. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmark landler By brushing it aside, by saying there are bigger things that we need to focus on than petty politics. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording (president barack obama) At stake is whether new jobs and industries take root in this country or somewhere else. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmichael barbaro Essentially, by ignoring it.\n\nmark landler Indeed. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording (president barack obama) The future is ours to win. But to get there, we can\u2019t just stand still. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmark landler So it was a very soaring message that was in keeping with the way President Obama ran for office, but one that didn\u2019t necessarily acknowledge the defeat that his party had just suffered.\n\nmichael barbaro So does the way that Obama responds to this division in this speech\u2014 by kind of ignoring it, by not fully acknowledging the new political terrain he has to confront\u2014 does this forecast how he ends up working with Congress for the next two years?\n\nmark landler I think it does quite accurately. Because if you look at what happens in the years after this, President Obama never really does form a good working relationship. He never really does roll up his sleeves and attempt to find much common ground with Republicans in Congress. And so, to some extent, these grand ideas remain just that\u2014 grand ideas, because he wasn\u2019t able to work with Republicans to translate them into more of a tangible reality.\n\nmichael barbaro So in that sense, the speech was a very honest and accurate predictor.\n\nmark landler Exactly. Indeed.\n\nmichael barbaro O.K. So it is 7:52, Mark\u2014 a little over an hour before President Trump gives his State of the Union. Given the history you\u2019ve just described, what do you expect his message to be now that he has divided government?\n\nmark landler We don\u2019t know exactly what he\u2019s going to say, but we do know that whatever their differences, all three of his predecessors issued a call for unity. Unity is the one theme that we can almost certainly expect to hear in virtually any State of the Union address. But what\u2019s really interesting is less that than what\u2019s between the lines, what\u2019s the subtext or the nuance in the State of the Union address. That\u2019s where you can really see what the president plans to do, how he plans to govern, what blueprint or what predicate he\u2019s putting in place. So what\u2019s going to be interesting in President Trump\u2019s address is not a call for unity. It\u2019s almost certainly going to be there. It\u2019s the other things that are in the speech that are going to really tell you what we can expect.\n\nmichael barbaro So, Mark, thank you for now. We will talk to you after Trump\u2019s State of the Union in, I guess, an hour or two.\n\nmark landler Look forward to it.\n\nmichael barbaro So, Mark, what did President Trump do tonight?\n\nmark landler Well, when President Trump took the rostrum in the House chamber tonight \u2014 [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording (president donald trump) Thank you very much. Madame Speaker. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmark landler He uttered the phrase \u201cMadame Speaker\u201d in deference to Nancy Pelosi, but he avoided giving her any further congratulations on taking up her position. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording (president donald trump) We meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmark landler He did, nevertheless, start off with\u2014 [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording (president donald trump) As we begin a new Congress, I stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all Americans. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmark landler A pretty standard call for bipartisanship and for unity. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording (president donald trump) Hoping that we will govern not as two parties, but as one nation. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmark landler He said at one point\u2014 [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording (president donald trump) Victory is not winning for our party\u2014 [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmark landler Victory is not winning for our party, victory is winning for our country. From there, he sort of segued into the economic achievements of his administration. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording (president donald trump) In just over two years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmark landler But at that point, he took a distinct turn in tone. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording (president donald trump) An economic miracle is taking place in the United States, and the only thing that can stop it\u2014 [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmark landler He basically said at this point\u2014 [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording (president donald trump) Are foolish wars, politics or ridiculous partisan investigations. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmark landler There can\u2019t be any cooperation on legislation if there\u2019s going to be what he called ridiculous partisan investigations of his presidency. This was a reference not only to potential future investigations by Congress, but also the Mueller investigation. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording (president donald trump) If there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation. It just doesn\u2019t work that way. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmark landler And he actually put a fairly menacing tone on it. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording (president donald trump) Now is the time for bipartisan action. Believe it or not, we have already proven that that\u2019s possible. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmark landler From there, he turns to a more bipartisan issue\u2014 criminal justice reform. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording (president donald trump) Criminal justice reform\u2014 they said it couldn\u2019t be done. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmark landler But almost immediately\u2014 [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording (president donald trump) Now Republicans and Democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmark landler He then segues into immigration, talks about the virtues and importance of building a wall. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording (president donald trump) Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmark landler And accuses the political elite of being divided from ordinary, working-class Americans. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording (president donald trump) While living their lives behind walls and gates and guards. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmark landler So the language here is extremely uncompromising. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording (president donald trump) Simply put\u2014 walls work, and walls save lives. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmark landler And this toggling continues throughout the speech. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording (president donald trump) Two weeks ago, the United States officially recognized the legitimate government of Venezuela. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmark landler At one point, he\u2019s talking about the global coalition to force out a tyrant, an autocrat in Venezuela. And yet in his next breath\u2014 [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording (president donald trump) Here in the United States, we are alarmed by the new calls to adopt socialism in our country. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmark landler He\u2019s likening this new class of Democrats in Congress to socialists. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording (president donald trump) America was founded on liberty and independence. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmark landler And saying, America will never be a socialist country. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording (president donald trump) We are born free, and we will stay free. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmichael barbaro But it sounds like you think that the conciliatory language is just the obligatory language of the State of the Union, and it\u2019s the harder-edged stuff that we should be listening to and thinking about in relation to past State of the Unions that you outlined before.\n\nmark landler I do. I think that if you look at the things the president talks about that are more conciliatory, they tend to be on the level of symbolism. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording (president donald trump) In recent years, we have made remarkable progress in the fight against H.I.V. and AIDS. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmark landler A campaign to fight AIDS with no dollar sign attached to it. A campaign to fight cancer in children with no specifics attached to it. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording (president donald trump) My budget will ask Congress for $500 million over the next 10 years to fund this critical, life-saving research. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmark landler While the areas where he\u2019s hard-edged are really the ones that matter to the future direction of governance and of his relationship with Congress. Whether he resolves this issue over funding the wall and, more broadly, whether he and the Democrats ever come to terms on immigration is really a core issue of how the rest of the Trump presidency will play out. That, much more than these conciliatory stories, these nice images, are really what matter in this speech. And I think the speechwriters were very careful to lard this speech with this kind of uplifting material. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording (president donald trump) In 2019, we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a quarter of a million miles through space to plant the American flag on the face of the moon. [END PLAYBACK] To make it more attractive to a broad audience while also speaking to the president\u2019s political base. But make no mistake\u2014 this speech was targeted to the political base. It was meant to mollify that base. And I think it\u2019s important that we not lose sight of that reality.\n\nmichael barbaro So where does this speech fit into the history of State of the Unions that have come after the dawn of divided government?\n\nmark landler Well, I think what\u2019s most significant is that there is really no acknowledgment in this speech of the changed circumstances. There\u2019s no acknowledgment here that President Trump faces a new political reality, that he has to do business with the Democrats if he wants to get any significant legislation passed. This is the speech given by a president who is behaving very much like he did the week he was inaugurated, when he had a unified Congress under his control.\n\nmichael barbaro Does that make this, then, an Obama-like State of the Union?\n\nmark landler I think the difference with President Obama is that, while he did not suggest that the defeat in the midterms was really going to change how he approached governing, he did at least acknowledge the fact that he had suffered an electoral setback in the midterms. In Mr. Trump\u2019s case, he didn\u2019t acknowledge the defeat he suffered in the midterm elections except in a highly indirect way. And it was actually one of the most remarkable moments of the evening. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording (president donald trump) No one has benefited more from our thriving economy than women. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmark landler President Trump was talking about the increasing numbers of women in the workplace, including in Congress. And spontaneously, this group of young, female Democratic lawmakers rose in unison and began chanting \u201cU.S.A\u201d and cheering and clapping. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording (president donald trump) Very good. And congratulations, that\u2019s great. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmark landler And the president broke into a smile and appeared, in a funny way, to be taking credit for their presence in the House\u2014 which, of course, is deeply ironic, because the reason they\u2019re in the House is because they were elected largely as a repudiation of him. So I think if you\u2019re looking for any signs of a newly pragmatic president or a president who will take heed of some of the concerns of the opposing party, I don\u2019t think we saw any of that in the speech tonight. And I would not expect to see any of that in his governing style over the next couple of years.\n\nmichael barbaro Well, Mark, it is almost 1:00 a.m. We are really grateful to you, thank you so much.\n\nmark landler Thank you, Michael. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording (president donald trump) Thank you. God bless you. And God bless America. Thank you very much. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmichael barbaro Here\u2019s what else you need to know today. On Tuesday, in the latest sign of progress toward a peace deal, leaders of the Taliban met with former high-ranking leaders of the Afghan government, including its former president in Moscow. The session excluded the leaders of Afghanistan\u2019s current government, who the Taliban views as a US puppet but was still the most significant contact between the Taliban and Afghan leaders since the US drove the Taliban from power in 2001. In a surprising development during the negotiations, the Taliban said it now respected women\u2019s rights, including the right to education and work, despite having banned women from public life when the group was in power. And. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording For example, you wrote in the 1990s that climate change is nothing more than a major environmental boogey man and the greenhouse effort is a controversial theory pushed by environmental groups. You still stand by those assertions? [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmichael barbaro During a heated confirmation hearing on Tuesday, senators from both parties questioned the past writings of Naomi Rowe, president Trump\u2019s nominee to replace Brett Kavanaugh on the powerful federal appeals court in Washington. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording Senator Leahy, those are statements from college, as you said, a few decades old when I think some of these issues were more hotly debated. And, no, I mean, I think the science has become much more conclusive over time. Conclusive in what way? Well, I think they\u2019re\u2014 my understanding is that there\u2019s an overwhelming scientific consensus that there is climate change. [END PLAYBACK]\n\nmichael barbaro Senators repeatedly asked Rowe to explain a series of provocative columns she wrote as a college student expressing skepticism about global warming and calling equality between women and men a dangerous concept. [AUDIO PLAYBACK]\n\narchived recording A dangerous feminist ideal is that women are created equal? Senator, I very much regret that statement and I\u2019ve always believed strongly in the equality of women and men and for equal rights and opportunities for women. I\u2019m honestly not sure why I wrote that in college. [END PLAYBACK]"

    "text": "Image copyright AFP Image caption Opponents to Mr Maduro say some of the \"colectivos\" are paramilitary groups (File photo)\n\nIn this dingy building in a suburb of Caracas, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez is very much alive. A statue of Venezuela's late president, dressed in military uniform, stands prominently at a corner of the main room as if welcoming everyone who enters.\n\nGlued to the decaying wall, a picture of him smiling, printed on the yellow, blue and red colours of the national flag, looks over the table where Subero and his men spend hours in meetings.\n\nSubero's decades-old links to Ch\u00e1vez go far beyond ideology. The 47-year-old retired sergeant fought in the attempt Ch\u00e1vez led on 4 February 1992 to overthrow then-President Carlos Andr\u00e9s P\u00e9rez. The movement failed, and Subero, Ch\u00e1vez and others spent some of the following years in jail.\n\nSubero's loyalty to his leader, however, was left unshaken.\n\nHe now leads one of the dozens of groups called colectivos, or collectives, which see themselves as the defenders of Ch\u00e1vez's Bolivarian revolution and vow to defend his successor, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, as he faces his biggest challenge yet.\n\nThe embattled leader has resisted mounting pressure to step down and call early elections while Juan Guaid\u00f3, head of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, gathers international recognition after declaring himself interim president.\n\nBut Subero and many others in his colectivo, by no coincidence called 4 de Febrero, seem ready to stand up for Mr Maduro, who has been in power since 2013.\n\n\"I'm willing to fight until my death,\" says Subero.\n\n'Foreign interference'\n\nThe colectivos emerged during Ch\u00e1vez's years and, with government backing, spread across communities as social organisations supporting the implementation of official aid programmes. They are believed to have a few thousand members all around the country.\n\nBut some have been accused by the opposition and human rights groups of acting as paramilitary groups, often using force to impose their control over neighbourhoods and attack government critics, protestors and journalists.\n\nImage copyright Kevin Jordan Image caption Subero: \"I'm ready and willing to go to war\"\n\nAs discontent with Mr Maduro grows, fuelled by an economy in freefall and widespread shortages of food and medicine, some fear things could turn even more violent with the armed colectivos, working alongside security forces loyal to the president, playing a key role in the streets.\n\nAt least 40 people were killed across the country in a week alone last month, according to the United Nations, with pro-government forces blamed for most of the deaths.\n\nFor Subero, a father of three who did not want to give his real name, the crisis here is \"being induced by foreign powers\", a claim often made by Mr Maduro and his allies, and an invasion is being planned, a fear consistently fanned by the government though it has never happened.\n\n\"I'm ready and willing to go to war,\" he said, surrounded also by religious sculptures and placards with the face of another local hero, 19th Century independence leader Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar, who Ch\u00e1vez claimed to be his \"revolutionary\" inspiration.\n\nImage copyright Kevin Jordan Image caption \"Who said Venezuela cannot be the new Vietnam?\" wondered Jorge Navas\n\nIn a dimly lit room next door, the old television, as usual, was tuned to Venezuela's state broadcaster, which devotes much of its time to the latest about Mr Maduro and his government.\n\nAs Jorge Navas watched it, Diosdado Cabello, a key Chavista, was passionately warning thousands of supporters of a possible international operation in the country.\n\n\"We're a militia and when the moment arrives, we'll take up arms,\" Mr Navas said, despite most colectivo members usually denying having any involvement in armed violence.\n\nPlease upgrade your browser to view this content.

Share this chatbot.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo has called the government a \"disastrous dictatorship\" while National Security Advisor John Bolton said Mr Maduro was holding an \"illegitimate claim to power\".\n\nWhen asked, in response to his Ku Klux Klan comment, if he believed Mr Trump was a \"white supremacist\", Mr Maduro said: \"He is, publicly and openly... They hate us, they belittle us, because they only believe in their own interests, and in the interests of the United States.\"\n\nMaduro on humanitarian aid: 'A charade'\n\nThe president has rejected allowing foreign humanitarian aid into the country, a move that is being organised by the opposition. He said Venezuela had \"the capacity to satisfy all the needs of its people\" and did not have to \"beg from anyone\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Venezuela's President Maduro to BBC: US aid trucks are a charade\n\nBut for years Venezuelans have faced severe shortages of basic items such as medicine and food. Last year, the inflation rate saw prices doubling every 19 days on average.\n\nThree million people, or 10% of the population, have left the country since the economy started to worsen in 2014, according to the UN. And Mr Guaid\u00f3 says more than 300,000 Venezuelans are at \"risk of dying\".\n\nMr Maduro, who has blamed US sanctions for Venezuela's economic woes, said the US intended to \"create a humanitarian crisis in order to justify a military intervention\".\n\n\"This is part of that charade. That's why, with all dignity, we tell them we don't want their crumbs, their toxic food, their left-overs.\"\n\nMaduro on calling elections: 'What's the point?'\n\nMr Maduro, in power since 2013, was re-elected to a second term last year but the elections were controversial with many opposition candidates barred from running or jailed, and claims of vote-rigging.\n\nHead of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, Mr Guaid\u00f3 declared himself president on 23 January, saying the constitution allowed him to assume power temporarily when the president was deemed illegitimate.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Desperate Venezuelan women are selling their hair at the border\n\nMr Maduro - who still has the support of Turkey, Russia and China and, crucially, of the Venezuelan army - said he did not see the need for early presidential elections.\n\n\"What's the logic, reasoning, to repeat an election?\" he asked.\n\nHe also said only \"about 10\" governments supported Mr Guaid\u00f3 - in fact, more than 30 have announced their support for the opposition leader - and that they were trying to \"impose a government that nobody has elected\".\n\n\"The extremists of the White House have taken it upon themselves to carry out a coup in Venezuela.\""

    "text": "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Venezuela's oil industry is a key source of cash for the government\n\nIn its battle against the rule of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, the United States has been trying to cripple the government's ability to secure funds and run the country - with sanctions that target officials, some sectors of the economy and its official cryptocurrency.\n\nBut so far it has not yet used what many call \"the nuclear option\" - a full oil embargo, targeting the industry that is responsible for 90% of the government's revenues.\n\nDespite the rhetoric between Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and President Donald Trump, refineries in the US are still buying Venezuelan petroleum. Venezuela's state company PDVSA even owns refineries in Texas through a subsidiary called CITGO.\n\nBut with the crisis escalating after Washington backed opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3's claim to the presidency last week, a new round of sanctions is expected in the coming days.\n\nOn Saturday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo failed to secure backing from the United Nations Security Council against Venezuela, as China and Russia are close Maduro allies.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Juan Guaid\u00f3 has declared himself interim president\n\nPresident Maduro backed down from his demand that US diplomats leave the country and said both countries now have a 30-day window to negotiate the new terms of their relationship.\n\nMarkets are watching now for what the US will do next. Despite its failure in the Security Council, the Trump administration has support from big regional players such as Brazil, Argentina and Colombia.\n\nIf it does finally move against Venezuelan oil, could that be the nail in the coffin of the country's oil industry, which has been in a crisis of its own for years? And what effect could that have for the rest of the world?\n\nMarkets nervous\n\nA boom in US shale production has helped slash crude prices over the past four years, although they have recovered slightly.\n\nBut 2019 is shaping up to be a very challenging year for the commodity, and there is no clear indication on which way prices will move.\n\nOil is never a predictable affair, however, and there are many situations that could cause prices to spike. Production is very volatile in Nigeria and Libya. Iran is under a heavy US embargo. Russia and Saudi Arabia are cutting production.\n\nFinally there are fears of a global slowdown in the economy which could see prices fall due to a drop in demand.\n\nThe crisis in Venezuela is another scenario watched closely by oil analysts.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Venezuelans have been fleeing the country as economic hardship worsens\n\nThere is a general sense in markets that Nicol\u00e1s Maduro will not be removed from power in the near future and that tensions will keep on rising. Also most analysts discard the full \"nuclear option\", as that would have a devastating impact on the people of Venezuela, instead of just hitting the government.\n\nOne of the most likely scenarios discussed is a partial restriction of how much oil the US can buy from Venezuela.\n\nThat would hurt consumers in America and in the rest of the world. Prices would rise as refineries would have to buy their share of oil from more expensive sources. American refineries that buy from Venezuela would also be negatively affected.\n\nBut US restrictions would benefit Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Iraq - countries that also produce the same variety of heavy crude oil (Canada also produces heavy crude but it does not have logistic capability to increase its exports). These countries have been eating into Venezuela's market share for years.\n\nWorld's largest reserves\n\nVenezuela would be the biggest loser of all, of course.\n\nThe country has the world's largest proven oil reserves - even bigger than Saudi Arabia - but it is rapidly running out of money to prospect for crude and pump it out of the ground.\n\nIn the late 1990s, Venezuela was producing more than three million barrels of oil per day. Output today is hovering above the one million mark, according to experts.\n\nEven without any international sanctions Venezuela's oil production will decline dramatically this year because of the lack of investment.\n\nThe rate of decline in production has been more intense in recent months.\n\nHelima Croft, from RBC Capital Markets, forecasts that output this year will drop by 300,000 to 500,000 barrels per day without any sanctions.\n\nRestrictions from Washington would accelerate the decline. Venezuela would be able to re-route part of its production to other buying nations, like China, but it wouldn't be able to pass on all of its excess oil to markets not aligned with the US.\n\n'Fleeing in droves'\n\nVenezuela is still seen as an oil powerhouse, especially because it is a producer of heavy crude, which is a variety not widely available in the world.\n\nBut the severity of its economic crisis may be changing that.\n\n\"It will require billions in investment to repair the infrastructure and kick start a recovery. The talented technocrats that once made PDVSA one of the premier national oil companies continue to flee in droves,\" she told the BBC.\n\n\"Even if a reformist government comes to power, the international community will have to launch a major reconstruction and rehabilitation effort to get the country back up on its feet.\"\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has resisted calls to stand down\n\nThe IMF now publishes separate indicators for Venezuela in its Latin American analysis. The economy there has become such an outlier that it makes no sense to compare it to other countries.\n\nThis year Venezuela's GDP is expected to reach a new low: the economy will be half the size of what it was in 2013.\n\nLast year the government tried again to use oil to solve its economic woes. It ended subsidies, raised the price of fuel domestically and ramped up its campaign to use a cryptocurrency allegedly pegged to barrels of oil.\n\nStill it failed to contain inflation, which is thought to have crossed the million per cent mark, and did not end its shortages of food and medicine.\n\nIt's hard to imagine life getting any harder for people in Venezuela. Now with fresh sanctions on the cards, it just may."

View more opinion on CNN.\n\nBrian Fonseca\n\n(CNN) Many governments, led by the US, have recognized National Assembly speaker Juan Guaido as the legitimate president of Venezuela. Russia, among others, is sticking with strongman President Nicolas Maduro. For Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has a tendency to support brutal, like-minded authoritarian leaders around the world, betting on Maduro is not a surprise.\n\nFrank O. Mora\n\nPutin has much to gain from this move: Venezuela under Maduro gives him an opportunity to flex Russia's muscles and needle the US in the Western Hemisphere, while affording economic inroads for Russia.\n\nBut there are limits to how far Putin will go, and the US shouldn't get too worked up by what Russia's power move amounts to: a bluff.\n\nDavid J. Kramer\n\nSometimes Putin's bets on authoritarian leaders turn out well, others not so. Putin's military intervention in Syria in September 2015 proved decisive in saving the murderous Bashar al-Assad and keeping him in power to this day. Putin's backing for former Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych ended with Yanukovych fleeing power in 2014 and Ukraine more pro-Western than ever, albeit at great cost because of Putin's ensuing invasion.\n\nMoscow relishes opportunities to challenge the US. Doing so in support of a dictator less than 1,500 miles away from Miami is especially enticing for Putin. Given Putin's belief that the West has meddled in Russia's neighborhood in Georgia and Ukraine, he sees Venezuela as an opportunity to return the favor to the United States.\n\nRead More"

    "text": "(CNN) As Venezuela's chaotic political situation continues and the world picks sides, President Nicolas Maduro is alleging the United States orchestrated a coup to remove him from the helm of the embattled nation.\n\nIn a Sunday interview, Maduro also accused Juan Guaido, the self-proclaimed interim president and head of the opposition-led National Assembly, of violating \"the constitution and all laws,\" which Maduro said is a matter for the courts.\n\nEric Farnsworth: \"The use of U.S. force in Venezuela not in the cards anytime soon.\"\n\nEric Farnsworth: \"The use of U.S. force in Venezuela not in the cards anytime soon.\" 03:47\n\nEric Farnsworth: \"The use of U.S. force in Venezuela not in the cards anytime soon.\"\n\n\"I am not the attorney general. It will be the job of the attorney general, it will be up to the courts to determine the steps to follow and we'll see. This pertains to the justice system,\" he told CNN Turk's Cuneyt Ozdemir.\n\nMaduro, however, says Venezuela is \"the victim of a US conspiracy,\" referring to reports that US Vice President Mike Pence promised Guaido full American support the day before he declared himself Venezuela's new leader.\n\nIn an interview with The Washington Post on Sunday, Guaido said Venezuela's opposition is in talks with military and civilian officials to force out Maduro. Guaido also told The Post the talks with the military were taking place \"behind the scenes.\"\n\n\"This is a very delicate subject involving personal security,\" Guaido told The Post. \"We are meeting with them, but discreetly.\"\n\n'Nobody gives us an ultimatum'\n\nOn Saturday, officials from the UK, Spain, Germany and France delivered Maduro an ultimatum: Call elections within eight days or Guaido will be recognized as president.\n\nThese are among the countries that support Maduro Bolivia\n\nChina\n\nCuba\n\nNicaragua\n\nRussia\n\nSyria\n\nTurkey\n\nSpeaking to CNN Turk, Maduro said Venezuela has held numerous elections of late -- including presidential elections in May (which the United States and several Latin American nations did not recognize as legitimate) -- and the European countries should withdraw their demand.\n\n\"Nobody gives us an ultimatum, he said. \"All of Europe is bowing down to Donald Trump. It's that simple, especially when it comes to Venezuela.\"\n\nThe Venezuelan leader told the Turkish network he has sent many messages to President Trump but has not received a response because \"I think he's overwhelmed with his domestic problem and, I believe, I think he despises us. He despises all of America and the Caribbean.

They don't want us to get better. They sabotage us and try to destroy the economic system.\"\n\nDespite taking the hard line that outside interference is behind the political turmoil in his country, Maduro said he was open to sitting down with his rivals.\n\n\"We will continue denouncing US lies, and I will continue to encourage national dialogue because I am up for a dialogue with all the political opposition, with the opposition media,\" he said. \"I think dialogue should prevail. I believe in dialogue.\"\n\nBoth Guaido and Maduro's communications minister, Jorge Rodriguez, have said Guaido has met with Maduro-aligned officials. The opposition leader also said he would consider amnesty for Maduro and his allies if they don't hamper his ascension to temporary power.\n\n'Maduro and his mayhem'\n\nFrom an international standpoint, the time for dialogue seems to have passed, judging from US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's address to the UN Security Council on Saturday, during which he urged members to back Guaido's transitional government.\n\n\"Our nations must stand up for the rule of law and support the leader who the Venezuelan people have affirmed as their legitimate interim president,\" Pompeo said. \"Either you stand with the forces of freedom, or you're in league with Maduro and his mayhem.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Why are people protesting in Venezuela?

During military exercises in Valencia, Maduro called for unity, saying he wanted to see the military grow \"more loyal to the people, more loyal to the revolution, more loyal to the country and more loyal to the constitution.\"\n\nJuan Guaido speaks to opposition supporters in Caracas on Saturday.\n\nAfter a Mass in Caracas to honor the victims of the country's protests, Guaido pitched the amnesty bill crafted by the National Assembly that would protect troops who defect from the Maduro administration.\n\n\"This is the moment to put yourself on the side of the constitution.

    "text": "Jeffrey Sachs is a professor and director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University . The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author; view more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) Events in Venezuela may be heading toward a catastrophic conflict. Venezuelan society is deeply divided between President Nicolas Maduro and his supporters, backed by the military, versus an opposition led by self-declared president, Juan Guaido , leader of the National Assembly.\n\nAccording to a report in The Wall Street Journal , which cited a senior administration official, the US promised it would back Guaido as part of a secret plan developed over several weeks. The US, along with Canada and several Latin American governments, quickly recognized Guaido as president, while China and Russia are backing Maduro. One spark could set off a civil war.\n\nNeither side appears willing to go down without a fight and new elections in these circumstances would be fraught with peril. If Venezuela had a parliamentary system, new elections might produce a broad coalition among several small parties. Unfortunately, with Venezuela's presidential system, an election now, if somehow organized, would amplify both the stark polarization between Maduro and the opposition -- and the threat of civil war.\n\nThe US' move to recognize Guaido is provocative. The problem is that the US has a track record of bullying Latin America and staging interventions in the region. These US interventions, both direct and indirect, have resulted in dozens of regime changes over the course of more than a century.\n\nEven if Guaido proves successful in his bid for power, millions in Latin America and around the world will view Maduro's overthrow as the latest case of US-led regime change.\n\nThe appointment of neoconservative Elliott Abrams on Friday as President Trump's new special envoy for Venezuela just two days after Guaido declared himself the new leader will only fuel the charges. Abrams famously advocated for the armed support of Nicaraguan Contras and pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts of withholding information from Congress about secret efforts to arm the rebel forces -- before he received a presidential pardon. Even if Guaido proves successful in gaining power, the view that the US once again helped to orchestrate regime change will embitter Venezuela and the region for years to come.\n\nInstead of a US-led regime change, the two sides need to share power temporarily, until new elections, perhaps in 2021. It seems inconceivable, yet history shows this can be done. Poland's successful transition to democracy in 1989 provides a pertinent example. In early 1989, Poland was on the brink of catastrophe, with martial law, a hugely unpopular Communist government, a collapsed economy and an incipient hyperinflation.\n\nIn Poland's case, the rapid transformation started with Mikhail Gorbachev's policies of perestroika and glasnost, or restructuring and openness. The Communist regime and the Solidarity opposition brokered a Round Table Agreement in 1989, which led to a partially free election for the Polish parliament later that year, which set the country on a path of deep economic reform.\n\nWhile Solidarity won a significant victory with a majority in the upper chamber of parliament, the communists retained control of the lower chamber. The Solidarity movement brilliantly found a way to peacefully break the deadlock and proposed the solution known as \"Your President, Our Prime Minister.\" The Communists would retain the presidency and the \"power ministries\" of interior and defense, while one of the Solidarity leaders became prime minister with the power to appoint his cabinet.\n\nThis compromise was put into practice and it held fast under the guidance and support of Gorbachev, the US, Europe and Pope John Paul II. The Communists did not meddle in economic management. Indeed, the new Polish government launched the most ambitious reform in modern history, designed to return Poland to the mainstream of the European economy. The reforms worked . Poland's economic collapse was reversed and economic growth resumed, setting it on course for European Union membership.\n\nViolence was completely avoided. In 1990, Wojciech Jaruzelski, the last Communist leader of Poland, stepped down and Poland elected Lech Walesa as president. Of course by then, the international scene had changed dramatically, with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the eventual dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991.\n\nThere is of course no precise analogue between Poland in 1989 and Venezuela today, but the comparison is apt. Venezuela, like Poland, needs a compromise that avoids a violent confrontation between the government and the opposition, a military coup, a civil war or, even more disastrously, a proxy war pitting US-backed contingents against Russian-backed contingents. Such a grim scenario might seem fanciful, yet Syria has been blown apart by such a proxy war during the past eight years.\n\nAnd like Poland, Venezuela has suffered an economic collapse. This is the sad, predictable result of Venezuela's failed policies under Maduro, also stoked by US economic sanctions that have further squeezed Venezuela's oil production and helped to push the country into vertiginous collapse.\n\nMaduro won re-election in 2018 with most of the opposition boycotting the election. Hyperinflation has now reached a rate of 1 million percent per year, with signs of acceleration. Venezuela has defaulted on its external obligations, including enormous sums owed to China and Russia, which will no doubt try to protect their claims.\n\nIn short, all sides have an urgent reason for compromise. The Venezuelan military aims to protect its privileged standing within the Chavez-Maduro system, yet it would like to end the economic catastrophe and avoid mass bloodshed. Maduro aims to hold power, yet is clearly incapable of solving Venezuela's economic crisis. He has lost the confidence of the overwhelming majority of the population. Yet for now he holds the backing of the military.\n\nThe humanitarian crisis in Venezuela is also very serious, with hunger, dire shortages of medicines, and massive refugee movements out of the country. These grim realities could propel a Polish-style compromise solution. Such a compromise would have Maduro remain as president, the military in effect hold the Ministries of Defense and Interior, and the opposition forces take over the civilian ministries and the Central Bank of Venezuela. Guaido, or some other leader in the opposition camp, would serve in effect as a prime minister, leading the civilian cabinet, and guiding Venezuela's economic policies. Elections would be agreed upon for 2021 or 2022, perhaps under a semi-parliamentary system by that time.\n\nThe major outside powers, notably the US, China and Russia, and the neighboring countries, would agree to and oversee the end of economic sanctions and the regularization of economic relations with the international institutions and the formulation of an emergency stabilization program. All creditor nations would be ready to take urgent steps, such as debt restructuring, needed to end the catastrophic hyperinflation. The UN Security Council would support these measures.\n\nStay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nWe are not currently on this path. The US instead appears to be aiming for regime change and tightening sanctions to bring Maduro to his knees. Such an outcome is perhaps feasible, though it would leave a very bitter legacy. More likely, though, it would occasion further violence and an escalation of the economic crisis, possibly leading to war.\n\nThis is the urgent time for compromise, not for a winner-take-all showdown."

    "text": "Frida Ghitis, a former CNN producer and correspondent, is a world affairs columnist. She is a frequent opinion contributor to CNN and The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author; view more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) How did it come to pass that President Donald Trump -- who insults Latin American migrants , vows to build a wall to keep them out, embraces authoritarian leaders around the world and undermines democracy at home -- is suddenly backing a pro-democracy uprising in Venezuela, recognizing opposition leader Juan Guaido as interim president, and doing it with the support of most Latin American nations, along with the world's leading liberal democracies?\n\nIf you are skeptical about Trump's claim that he cares about democracy in Venezuela, I'm right there with you. Trump has made it inescapably clear he has a soft spot for dictators and no great passion for liberal democracy, with its pesky separation of powers, independent rule of law, free press and protection of minorities.\n\nThat, however, doesn't mean he is wrong in backing the opposition against President Nicolas Maduro. Trump is supporting Venezuelans' legitimate demands for genuine democracy in a contest that, as I have written , is not a Cold war-era battle between left and right, but a 21st-century one that pits Maduro, a populist authoritarian, against Guaido, who is backed by democracies such as Canada, the European Union and most Latin American nations.\n\nThe US position is one that many of us, including Trump critics, believe is justified -- as long as the President and his top aides continue to work alongside other democracies to back the opposition and manage to refrain from intervening militarily or significantly worsening the hardships of the Venezuelan people.\n\nTo understand better how and why the United States decided to get involved, we need to look at what is happening in Venezuela, Latin America and beyond.\n\nThe history of US policy in the region is a winding landscape of neglect, missteps and a few good ideas. Critics of the US decision to back Guaido are both skeptical of Trump and wary that Washington will repeat its mistakes.\n\nIn 1823, President James Monroe announced what later became known as the Monroe Doctrine, which warned the colonial powers in Europe to stay away from the Americas. But the United States went on to exert its own power over Latin America. At the turn of the century, Teddy Roosevelt helped orchestrate Panama's secession from Colombia to secure US control over the Panama Canal.\n\nAnd during the Cold War, Washington sowed resentment in Latin America by supporting several right-wing coups. In Chile, the United States backed the uprising against President Salvador Allende , which led to Augusto Pinochet's dictatorship.\n\nBut not every US policy promoted tyranny; some recognized why an impoverished region might consider radical alternatives and sought to address the causes.\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy, who was determined to improve US relations in Latin America, tried to use economic development as a way to stem the spread of communism. In his inaugural address in 1961, Kennedy announced the Alliance for Progress and told \"our sister republics south of our border\" that the United States would help in \"casting off the chains of poverty.\" He called the plan \"a vast cooperative effort ... to satisfy the basic needs of the (Latin) American people for homes, work and land, health and schools.\"\n\nUnder President Bill Clinton, the United States partnered with Bogota on Plan Colombia -- a successful, multipronged policy initiated in 2000 that helped the Colombian government retake the country from guerrilla groups and drug traffickers, while aiming to strengthen economic development and democratic institutions.\n\nColombia was still in the midst of a longstanding conflict between the government, Marxist guerrilla militias and paramilitary groups years after the Soviet Union collapsed. In addition to military assistance, Plan Colombia focused on improving the rule of law, social and economic development, and human rights.\n\nDespite some unintended consequences , the policy pulled the country back from the brink of collapse, and ultimately led to both a peace deal and a Nobel Peace Prize -- for Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos. With Washington's help, a more peaceful Colombia was able to make a dramatic transition from iron fist to velvet glove and turn a near-failed state into a success story.\n\nIn Venezuela, Hugo Chavez was elected in 1998, with the promise of fighting corruption and poverty and writing a new socialist constitution. His ascent sparked the so-called \"pink tide,\" which saw socialist leaders rising to power across the continent.\n\nBut the price of export commodities that had bankrolled leftist governments such as Venezuela's eventually collapsed. Economies that had been growing started to shrink, and corruption scandals exploded across the region.\n\nChavez's handpicked successor, Maduro, was elected in 2013, and Venezuela fell into a recession the following year as a result of the drop in oil prices, catastrophic economic mismanagement and rampant corruption. This has caused unspeakable human suffering hunger and inflation, which is expected to hit 10 million% this year.\n\nAs Maduro accelerated the drift toward dictatorship millions of desperate, fleeing Venezuelans poured across the region, straining the resources of neighboring countries with close ties to the United States. These countries looked for support from Washington, where the Trump administration is staffed with hard-liners whose views are favorable to intervention.\n\nAdding to the geopolitical incentives for Washington to take the crisis seriously, Russia and China have made deep inroads in Latin America. China has replaced the United States as a top trading partner in many Latin American countries, and Russia has pursued a concerted plan to challenge US political, economic and military dominance. It already has a satellite-tracking facility in Nicaragua , and in December, Russia showed off its military ties to Venezuela by flying supersonic jets across the Caribbean from Venezuela. The show of force was reportedly part of a plan to establish a long-term military presence on a Venezuelan island in the Caribbean Sea, according to Russian state news agency TASS\n\nStay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nWith Russia and China making moves, the Trump administration may have found a more compelling reason for action in Latin America. As the conflict intensifies, the United States and other democracies are right to continue supporting the opposition. Washington should help facilitate diplomatic negotiations that lead to new, fair and free elections, and coordinate international sanctions calibrated to pressure the regime without worsening the humanitarian crisis. The task is to find a path toward the peaceful restoration of democracy."

    "title": "Why Ocasio-Cortez shouldn't be taking pointers from Corbyn",
    "text": "Kate Maltby is a broadcaster and columnist in the United Kingdom on issues of culture and politics, and a theater critic for The Guardian. She is also completing a doctorate in Renaissance literature. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) Subscribers to the London Times this Monday found a familiar face, Luciana Berger, writing about a wearily familiar topic in British politics: the resurgence of hard-left anti-Semitism. Berger is one of the UK Labour Party's highest profile Jewish MPs, a prominent activist since her college days. Three far-right trolls have served jail sentences for sending her racist harassment or death threats.\n\nBut what now worries Berger is the increasing online abuse she receives from social media accounts that claim to support the leader of her own political party, Jeremy Corbyn. With Corbyn in charge of the Labour Party, attention is shifting in Britain from the anti-Semitism of the hard-right to that of the hard-left. The eminent political scientist Vernon Bogdanor recently warned the Jewish community that \"there can be no comparison between the minuscule anti-Semitic threat from the far right and the widespread legitimization of anti-Semitism by the Corbynite leadership of the Labour Party.\"\n\nNot surprisingly, on Monday night Labour MPs passed a formal resolution calling on their own leadership to do more to tackle anti-Semitism. Yet this weekend, of all weekends, American Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez chose to publicly thank Corbyn for a mutually congratulatory phone call in which they discussed \"the peace, prosperity, + justice that everyday people can create when we uplift one another across class, race, + identity both at home & abroad.\"\n\nClearly, Ocasio-Cortez did not ask how \"uplifted\" Jewish people in Britain feel by Corbyn. Since her tweet about Corbyn, Ocasio-Cortez has responded to Jewish community leaders' concerns by promising to \"reach out\" and reiterating her \"deep fellowship and leadership with the Jewish community.\"\n\nBut it's not difficult for any American member of Congress to know that citing Corbyn as a political model might be bad idea. Were it possible to ignore his seeming tolerance for anti-Semitism, his post-truth attitude to political debate and his intrinsically anti-American foreign policy would still be reason enough to fear the contagion of Corbynism in US politics. But as it is, his tolerance for anti-Semitism is indeed impossible to ignore.\n\nIt is nearly a year since the British Jewish community congregated outside Parliament to protest the Labour leader's reluctance to confront anti-Semitism among his hard-left allies; nearly a year since Corbyn was found to have voiced support for an anti-Semitic mural depicting Jews as conspiratorial world manipulators, nine months since video of Corbyn emerged speaking alongside Holocaust deniers, suggesting that \"Zionists\" were insufficiently English to understand \"English irony\"; and six months since photographs were published of Corbyn at a memorial ceremony in a Tunisian cemetery for Palestinian leaders believed to have ordered the killings of Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympic games.\n\nCorbyn denies allegations of anti-Semitism and that he tolerates anti-Semitism. Reporters who write about his contact with known anti-Semites are attacked by his allies as purveyors of \" fake news .\" (In the case of the Palestinian memorial ceremony, after a firefight of claim and counterclaim in the British media over the exact layout of the Tunisian cemetery, Corbyn eventually admitted to being \"present\" but not \"involved\" when a wreath was laid on the memorial to the masterminds of the Munich attack.)\n\nYet for someone who firmly denies tolerating anti-Semitism, Corbyn has a bad habit of attracting anti-Semitic company. No wonder Britain's three Jewish newspapers last year put their internal differences aside to call Corbyn \"an existential threat to Jewish life\" in Britain.\n\nBut let's put aside, if that's morally possible even as a thought experiment, the issue of anti-Semitism. There are other reasons for the Democratic Party to be wary of a Corbyn-Ocasio-Cortez alliance. Corbyn's left-populism is one model of one route the Democratic Party could go down as it seeks to build a movement powerful enough to cancel out the right-populism of President Donald Trump. They should beware it.\n\nCorbyn, as he showed in the debacle over the Palestinian memorial, has the Trumpian gift of emerging from every credible new allegation against him as if he's proved demonstrably that he's the victim of a media smear campaign. Accused of offending Jews, he took offense . This approach may mobilize left-wing voters, but it leaves democracy poorer for it. Corbynism is a mode of politics that assumes bad faith as a starting point; it is not the way to counter the toxicity already unleashed into the public sphere by Trump.\n\nLike Ocasio-Cortez, Corbyn carries extraordinary influence over millennial voters, tapping into the economic fragility of a generation for whom personal \"capital\" -- or the great British dream of owning your own home -- was something their parents could build but today's young people can't imagine. Like Ocasio-Cortez, he has been a critic of the way \"the gig economy\" erodes labor rights. And like his American counterpart, Corbyn's deepest political values stem from a fundamental skepticism of Western power and prosperity: what Ocasio-Cortez has recently called \"this weird American dream mythology.\"\n\nYet like her, Corbyn and his supporters are known for spending more of their firepower on members of their own party than the enemy across the aisle. Corbyn had spent 30 years as a backbench MP without any seeming aspiration to hold party office -- a position that emboldened him to rebel against the party line, or \"whip,\" 428 times during Labour's time in control of the legislative assembly.\n\nThe same leniency is not shown to MPs who rebel against Corbyn's leadership: Corbyn's allies have been making moves for some time to deselect MPs who break his whip from their constituencies. Since Corbyn's election as Labour leader, the phrase \"F--- off and join the Tories\" has become so common an insult, hurled online by Corbynites at Labour supporters deemed overly moderate or \" centrist \" that many moderate voters have decided to do just that.\n\nThose told they're not welcome in Corbyn's party include the author and philanthropist J.K. Rowling , a major donor to past leaders. In 2010, Rowling wrote an op-ed urging her fans to vote for Labour's Gordon Brown, in a last-ditch effort to keep his failing Labour government in power. Accusing the Conservative \"Tory\" Party of treating single mothers like herself as \"bogeymen,\" she wrote, \"The 2010 election campaign, more than any other, has underscored the continuing gulf between Tory values and my own.\"\n\nNine years and a few public criticisms of Corbyn later, it is Rowling who is frequently attacked as a \"raging Tory\" by Labour members. Anyone who disagrees with the leader must be an enemy to the party as a whole, no matter how publicly they may have demonstrated their party loyalty in the past.\n\nAnd yet the British electorate would still keep this government in power rather than vote for Corbyn. There could be no greater indictment of his candidacy.\n\nDemocrats are tempted by Ocasio-Cortez for all the reasons the Labour left first fell for Corbyn. She connects instinctively with young voters: If a journalist picks her up on a small matter like accuracy, she's able to rally her millions of social media followers to return fire on the press until many journalists would find the process of holding her to account simply exhausting. Corbyn's outriders at propaganda outlets like Novara Media and Skwawkbox specialize in doing the same. Corbynism offers the easy warmth of moral tribalism and of clearly distinguished enemies: Israel and anyone who's ever voted Conservative. The similar tendencies displayed by the social media tribes who rally around Ocasio-Cortez's every tweet should be a warning to the Democratic leadership.\n\nStay up to date...

Given Corbyn's lifelong criticism of US \"imperialism,\" it seems that any dictator who criticizes the United States is a good dictator.\n\nOcasio-Cortez and her generation of New Democrats need to learn that you can't stand in solidarity with the international hard left -- and with Jewish Americans. But they could also take a look at Corbyn and learn that however much you hate the status quo, it's not good enough to simply position your politics as inherently oppositional. Life as a young upstart, or a long reputation as a rebel backbencher, is no qualification for government.\n\nDestroy the establishment, sure. But have something planned to replace it. And try not to follow Corbyn's model."

They said that they would recognise Mr Guaid\u00f3 as interim president if no such pledge was forthcoming.\n\nOn Monday, the UK and Spain officially recognised Mr Guaid\u00f3 as interim president.\n\nSpain's Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez urged him to call elections \"as quickly as possible.\"\n\n\"Venezuela should be the author of its own destiny.

    "title": "Venezuela crisis: What now for Maduro and his allies?",
    "text": "Image copyright AFP Image caption A demonstrator holds a sign reading 'We have a free Venezuela' during anti-Maduro protests in Colombian capital Bogot\u00e1\n\nThe political crisis in Venezuela has taken a dramatic new turn with the decision by US President Donald Trump and several Latin American countries to recognise the opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 as the country's interim president.\n\nTheir decision has inevitably inflamed tensions, bolstering critics of socialist President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro who, in response, has cut ties with Washington. So what happens next?\n\nOur diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus and Latin America online editor Vanessa Buschschluter look at what could change - both inside and outside Venezuela.\n\nCan external pressure change things on the ground?\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has served as president of Venezuela since 2013\n\nJonathan Marcus: In a sense, the declarations from the US, Canada and a number of other Latin American countries, including Venezuela's neighbours Brazil and Colombia, change everything and nothing.\n\nPresident Maduro retains the levers of power. His opponents, of course, will be emboldened, but this could simply be a recipe for civil strife and repression.\n\nTwo parallel governments recognised by different countries abroad means little if President Maduro retains the support of the forces of law and order, and especially the military.\n\nIn such a situation, Venezuela's economic chaos is only likely to get worse.\n\nWhat is the likelihood of prolonged unrest?\n\nVanessa Buschschluter: Events in Venezuela are notoriously hard to predict because neither the government nor the opposition are monolithic groups.\n\nInstead they are made up of factions that often disagree, and the faction that holds power can shift quickly.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Mr Guaid\u00f3 has energised Venezuela's opposition since he became head of the National Assembly\n\nThe last mass protests in Venezuela were in 2017. The government's response was quick.\n\nThe National Guard fired tear gas and rubber bullets and - in some cases - live rounds. The deaths quickly mounted and were well over 100 on both sides of the political divide.\n\nThe UN said the security forces had used disproportionate force and arbitrary detentions to instil fear.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Thousands gather for rally against Venezuela's Maduro\n\nIn August 2017, after more than four months, the protests died down with many of those who had formerly taken to the streets saying they did not want to risk their lives or face arrest.\n\nWhether there will be unrest in the wake of Mr Guaid\u00f3's move to declare himself acting president will depend largely on the reaction of Venezuela's security forces to the renewed protest marches.\n\nWhat further steps could the US take?\n\nJonathan Marcus: The Trump administration has a variety of tools at its disposal. It could step up economic sanctions; it could reinforce asset freezes targeted against individuals or entities associated with the Maduro government.\n\nIt could also put the government and its military commanders on notice that any attacks on civilians or stepped-up repression will be closely monitored and documented, with the possibility of some form of international judicial involvement in the future.\n\nBut economic sanctions are a blunt instrument and, in an impoverished society, are only likely to make things even worse for ordinary people.\n\nCould this crisis take on a military dimension?\n\nJonathan Marcus: Despite his rhetoric, President Trump is remarkably risk-averse in terms of military deployments.\n\nAfter all, this is the president who is pulling US troops out of Syria and reportedly wants to slash US forces in Afghanistan by half.\n\nIt is unlikely that he will want to send the marines into Venezuela in current circumstances.\n\nHowever, if the country descended into total chaos, there might be calls from some quarters for intervention.\n\nThat would require significant international support - especially from within Latin America - and probably backing at the UN Security Council, too.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Members of Venezuela's military leadership have expressed their support for Maduro\n\nIt is hard to see this being forthcoming, given Russia's support for President Maduro and China's traditional opposition to what it sees as meddling in individual countries' affairs.\n\nAt the moment, there is only one military that matters and that is in Venezuela itself. In past upsurges of protest, the armed forces have stood by President Maduro.\n\nWill this remain the case? It is their loyalty which will determine the fate of the current regime. But if the military or wider security forces split, then this again could simply lead to greater violence.\n\nVanessa Buschschluter: The security forces have so far been loyal to President Maduro and his government.\n\nMr Maduro has kept them on his side by regularly raising their wages and rewarding them for their loyalty.\n\nHe has also put senior military officials in key posts in the government. But with Venezuela's economy further deteriorating, the lower ranks are reportedly getting increasingly dissatisfied with the government, which they blame for the shortages of medicines and food and frequent power and water cuts.\n\nA video widely shared on social media after an aborted rebellion by a small group of National Guardsmen on 14 January shows one of them complaining about the fact his mother cannot get cancer drugs.\n\nFootage uploaded to social media after Wednesday's protests also appeared to show a group of National Guardsmen blocking a road but walking away as protesters approached, to the applause of those marching.\n\nHowever, the higher ranks still appear to be loyal to Mr Maduro. On Thursday, Defence Minister Gen Vladimir Padrino read out a statement condemning what he called an attempted coup d'etat, which he said was backed by the extreme right and \"criminal agents\".\n\nHow is this crisis dividing the international community?\n\nJonathan Marcus: Russia - one of Venezuela's few backers - has taken exception to President Trump's decision.\n\nIt has warned the US not to intervene militarily.\n\nA Kremlin spokesman has said that outside interference in the country is \"unacceptable\".\n\nRussia has invested heavily in Venezuela's oil industry.\n\nIt has close military ties with the country. Last December, for example, two Russian long-range bombers flew to Venezuela as a gesture of support for President Maduro, angering Washington, which has sought to isolate him.\n\nThe European Union has called for a political process leading to free and fair elections.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said his country still recognises Nicol\u00e1s Maduro as Venezuela's leader\n\nIt is almost like a throw-back to the Cold War days, though with a new twist.\n\nThe Turkish government too has backed President Maduro - a move which, for some, will place Turkey into an emerging axis of more authoritarian-leaning governments.\n\nLatin America, too, is dividing along political lines with Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Argentina, Paraguay and Costa Rica all backing the US move.\n\nBolivia's President Evo Morales - a strong critic of Mr Trump - has attacked what he has called an imperialist assault on South America's right to democracy and self-determination.\n\nThis traditional resort to the cry of \"Yankee imperialism\" may resonate less today than it once did in Latin America.\n\nBut the Venezuela crisis will not be helped if it becomes subsumed into the wider tensions between Washington and Moscow.\n\nStill, the real political battle is on the ground in Venezuela itself.\n\nThe opposition may have the bulk of the external political support. But it is Venezuela's military and its own people who have to determine their destiny.\n\nThis week may mark a turning point but the choice could still be between a resolution or worsening chaos.\n\nWhat's different about the protests this time?\n\nVanessa Buschschluter: For the first time in years, the opposition appears to be uniting around a single leader.\n\nJuan Guaid\u00f3 may be relatively new to politics but he appears to have inspired those critical of President Maduro in a way other opposition leaders before him did not.\n\nHe also appealed to those who have so far supported the government to join the protest movement.\n\nReferring to anti-government protests which broke out in government strongholds earlier this week, he wrote: \"The protests in the west of Caracas show that there's no barrier to jump. Here we're all in the same shoes: without electricity, without medicines, without gas and with an uncertain future. We're all in mired in the same crisis,\" he wrote on Twitter.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Venezuelan police have clashed with thousands of protestors since Mr Guaid\u00f3 declared himself \"acting president\"\n\nThe protests in the poorer areas of Caracas are also a key signal that anti-government sentiment is no longer confined to the middle and upper classes.\n\nIn the past, the poorest sectors of society tended to be the staunchest supporters of the government as they were the recipients of government-funded aid programmes such as social housing.\n\nBut footage of people banging pots and shouting \"Maduro go\" in some of these areas would suggest that their loyalty can no longer be taken for granted."

Ch\u00e1vez overhauled the country's economic system and was increasingly opposed to US foreign policy.\n\nRelations have continued to worsen under Mr Maduro who came to power in 2013 after Ch\u00e1vez died.\n\nImage copyright Getty/EPA\n\nThe US has criticised Mr Maduro's increased use of the country's courts and security forces to suppress political opposition.\n\nThey declared his re-election last year as \"illegitimate\" and imposed a raft of economic measures against Venezuela.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption The US houses about 100,000 Venezuelans - many who oppose Mr Maduro\n\nIn turn, US sanctions have been used as a scapegoat by Mr Maduro to shift blame for the country's economic woes.\n\nAmid a deepening economic crisis, Venezuela has struggled to utilise its supply of the world's largest proven oil reserves.\n\nUS purchases of that oil have declined sharply - but companies still import about 500,000 barrels from the country daily.\n\nThis amounts to about 41% of Venezuela's total oil exports, the Associated Press reports.\n\nCrucially, unlike other countries that Venezuela is indebted to, American firms pay for that oil in cash.\n\nFresh Trump administration sanctions aim to frustrate that source of income by targeting PDVSA, the Venezuelan state oil company.

    "text": "Image copyright Reuters Image caption Mr Maduro faces further opposition protests against his presidency on Wednesday\n\nVenezuela's President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has dismissed calls for new presidential elections amid fresh protests against his leadership.\n\nIn a show of defiance, he insisted his victory in polls last spring had been legitimate.\n\nOpposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 declared himself interim president last week, prompting an escalating power struggle.\n\nIn an interview with a Russian news agency, Mr Maduro said he was prepared to hold talks with the opposition.\n\n\"I am ready to sit down at the negotiating table with the opposition so that we could talk for the good of Venezuela,\" he told Russian news agency RIA in Caracas.\n\nMr Maduro said that if the US and others wanted a fresh vote, they would have to wait until 2025, but added that he would support early parliamentary elections as \"a good form of political discussion\".\n\nHe added that he was not prepared to accept ultimatums or blackmail, and insisted that he has the backing of Venezuela's military, and accused deserters of conspiring to plot a coup.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Correspondents say Wednesday's protests didn't attract huge crowds\n\n\"Military deserters have become mercenaries of the Colombian oligarchy and conspire from Colombia to divide the armed forces,\" he said, without providing further details.\n\nHis comments came as new protests called by Mr Guaid\u00f3 began.\n\nThe opposition leader, who is head of Venezuela's National Assembly, says the constitution allows him to assume power temporarily when the president is deemed illegitimate.\n\n'Pushing at an open door'\n\nAnalysis by Barbara Plett Usher, BBC News, Washington\n\nWhile Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his allies moved to curb Juan Guaid\u00f3 inside Venezuela, Mr Guaid\u00f3's man in Washington, Carlos Vecchio, was working to make the most of US support. He was pushing at an open door, with meetings on Capitol Hill, at the White House and the Treasury.\n\nThis was about consolidating diplomatic legitimacy for Mr Guaid\u00f3's government, but also about money: Mr Vecchio told us he was working to gain control of Venezuelan assets recently frozen by the administration.\n\nMr Vecchio assured us his Washington appointment would be \"the shortest of his life\" because he wanted to get back to Caracas. But in the meantime he hoped his access to the Venezuelan embassy building could be resolved \"in the days to come\".\n\nIn a briefing, the state department's Venezuela envoy, Elliot Abrams, downplayed his dark history of supporting US-backed Latin American dictators during the Reagan administration in the 1980s, saying \"this was 2019\" and that the US was supporting Venezuela's democratic opposition.\n\nHow does the world see the crisis?\n\nThe US and more than 20 other nations have backed Mr Guaid\u00f3. The White House said on Wednesday that he and President Trump had agreed to maintain regular communication to \"support Venezuela's path back to stability\".\n\nVenezuela's Supreme Court has banned Mr Guaid\u00f3 from leaving the country, however, and frozen his bank accounts.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Who's really in charge in Venezuela? The BBC's Paul Adams explains\n\nMr Maduro has the backing of Russia, China, Mexico and Turkey.\n\nRussian officials have denied reports that mercenaries from the country have been sent to protect his life.\n\nUS officials have previously stated that all options \"are on the table\" to resolve the crisis in Venezuela, which observers have taken to include possible military action.\n\nCurbs were imposed on the country's state-owned oil firm PDVSA on Monday, which US National Security Adviser John Bolton said was to ensure that President Maduro could \"no longer loot the assets of the Venezuelan people\".\n\nMr Bolton also appeared at a news briefing with a notepad showing the words \"5,000 troops to Colombia\" - which borders Venezuela.\n\nWhy is there opposition to President Maduro?\n\nVenezuela is facing acute economic problems and there has been an upsurge in violence in recent weeks.\n\nProtests have been held across the country since Mr Maduro began his second term on 10 January. He was elected last year during a controversial vote in which many opposition candidates were barred from running, or jailed.\n\nAt least 40 people are believed to have died and hundreds have been arrested since 21 January, the UN says.\n\nHyperinflation and shortages of essentials such as food and medicine have forced millions to flee the nation."

    "text": "Image copyright Getty Images\n\nAs the political and economic pressure on Nicol\u00e1s Maduro mounts, Venezuela's president believes there is one person he can rely on - Vladimir Putin.\n\nThe Kremlin has accused the opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 of an \"illegal attempt to seize power\", backed by the United States. Moscow says it will do \"everything required\" to support Nicol\u00e1s Maduro as Venezuela's \"legitimate president\".\n\nBut Russia's appetite for protecting relations with Caracas may be more limited than its rhetoric suggests.\n\nYears of close alliance\n\nMoscow has long been a key ally of President Maduro, and Hugo Ch\u00e1vez before him - as fierce critics of Washington, right in America's backyard.\n\n\"The relationship is symbolically important. It's about saying 'we're not alone, there are others who are very critical of the US and Western policy',\" explains Andrei Kortunov of the Russian International Affairs Council.\n\nThat's partly why Moscow has expanded co-operation with Caracas in recent years - increasing arms sales, extending credit and even flying in two bombers last December in a show of support.\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption Venezuela's defence minister welcomed the two long-range Russian bombers when they flew to Caracas in December\n\nIts backing for Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in the current crisis is also fuelled by a horror of popular uprisings, particularly those supported openly by the West.\n\nMore on the Venezuela crisis:\n\n\"Unpopular social policies, an impoverished population and economic crisis - against a background of battling the whole world and corrupt\u2026 politicians. Guess which country this refers to?\" independent newspaper Novaya Gazeta wondered this week.\n\nIt was drawing the parallels with Russia that it believes the Kremlin sees - and fears - in Caracas.\n\nMoscow also has money at stake. It has sunk significant amounts into backing Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, much of that in loans it stands to lose if he is forced from office.\n\nThe full extent of Russia's exposure isn't clear.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Who's really in charge in Venezuela? The BBC's Paul Adams explains\n\nAnalysts talk of $17bn (\u00a313bn), mostly dished out in credit to the Maduro government. But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to put a figure on it when questioned by journalists earlier this week.\n\nHe was even more tight-lipped on whether Russia worried about losing that investment. \"I won't respond to that,\" Mr Peskov said.\n\nThen there's the oil\n\nVenezuela sits on the largest proven oil reserves in the world.\n\n\"When we sent weapons, no-one thought of collecting the debt. What was really in mind, I think, was access to the oil wells, to production,\" argues Carnegie Centre economist Andrei Movchan.\n\nRussia's state-owned firm, Rosneft, now has stakes in multiple projects in Venezuela and has issued significant loans to the country's oil giant, PDVSA.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Rosneft's chief executive Igor Sechin (L) has overseen much of Russia's oil investment in Venezuela\n\n\"Venezuela was in a bad shape, so it was easy to agree terms,\" Mr Movchan says.\n\n'A black hole for Russia'\n\nBut whilst state television programmes here have been blasting headlines, slamming the US \"intervening in the affairs of a sovereign state\", others have been questioning the wisdom of Russia's own Venezuela policy.\n\n\"Venezuela is a black hole for Russia, where billions of dollars have been sunk\u2026 and the effect is zero,\" analyst Mikhail Krutikin told Kommersant newspaper. He talked of \"utter incompetence and squandering.\"\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Juan Guaid\u00f3: \"Maduro's regime is killing young, poor people on the streets\"\n\n\"It's a very unfortunate situation,\" Andrei Kortunov says. \"We knew this was coming, so I wonder what the fall-back position is of those who invested there, but I don't see it.\"\n\nRussia is now advocating political negotiations in Venezuela, with international mediation. It presents the opposition, and the US, as intransigent for continuing to call for fresh elections.\n\nWhat is Moscow doing?\n\nMeanwhile, with no sign of imminent mass defection by the military, reports have emerged suggesting Moscow may be upping its support for Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\n\nAs fresh US sanctions were imposed on Caracas this week, Novaya Gazeta suggested that Russia had helped fly Venezuelan gold from storage in the Russian Central Bank for sale in Dubai.\n\nThe paper's sources claimed over $1bn in cash was then taken on to Caracas. The Central Bank chairwoman said that did not \"correspond to reality\".\n\nThere have also been reports that Moscow has deployed private military contractors, possibly as protection for President Maduro.\n\nThe Kremlin has rebutted that, too, though Mr Maduro himself was simply evasive. \"I'm not making any comment,\" he told Russian reporters this week.\n\nHow far will it go?\n\nThe foreign ministry pledge to do \"everything\" to back Nicol\u00e1s Maduro does seem to have limits.\n\n\"I don't think Russia would defend Maduro militarily. We are for a political settlement,\" argues retired Lieutenant-General Evgeny Buzhinsky. He describes those bombers sent to Caracas last year as simply \"symbolic\".\n\nImage copyright AFP Image caption One Russian tabloid mocked the number of opposition protesters who turned out on Wednesday\n\n\"It would be madness for Russia to try to intervene with force,\" Andrei Movchan agrees. \"Venezuela is not Syria. The Chinese are there and the Americans are much closer.\"\n\nAt least in public, Russia has settled for condemning US pressure, calling for dialogue - and waiting. Perhaps it is hoping its ally can weather the storm.\n\nAs one tabloid newspaper here argued, opposition rallies on Wednesday were smaller than expected.\n\n\"They held the decisive protest - and then they called the next one,\" Komsomolskaya Pravda joked, suggesting \"something went wrong\".\n\nAnother paper, though, is convinced President Maduro's days in office are numbered, suggesting the Kremlin should simply offer \"its friend\" political asylum.\n\n\"The long, cold Moscow winter is not ideal of course for Maduro, used to palm trees and a year-round average of 25C,\" Moskovsky Komsomolets reasoned.\n\n\"But it's still better than a warm prison cell in Caracas.\""

If countries such as China and Russia continue to support Venezuela, the government may be able to appeal to them for additional help.\n\nIvan Briscoe, the International Crisis Group's programme director for Latin America, told me on Friday he thought Mr Maduro could survive additional sanctions.\n\nMeanwhile, he warned that the situation for Venezuelans would get worse should the US, China and Russia continue to treat the country as a \"football in a bigger political game\".\n\nWho supports whom?\n\nRussia, China, Mexico and Turkey have publicly backed Mr Maduro.\n\nAt a UN Security Council meeting on Saturday, Russia accused Washington of plotting a coup.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Who's really in charge in Venezuela?

    "text": "Image copyright Archivo Fotograf\u00eda Urbana / Proyecto Helicoide Image caption El Helicoide was meant as a symbol of Venezuela's ambitions fuelled by oil riches\n\nIn the centre of the Venezuelan capital Caracas, an extraordinary space-age building towers over the sprawling slums below.\n\nEl Helicoide was once the symbol of a rich and promising nation.\n\nToday, it houses one of Venezuela's most infamous jails, and embodies the country's decline from Latin American powerhouse to crisis zone.\n\n'Instant modernity'\n\nEl Helicoide was built in the 1950s, when Venezuela had big dreams - and big money from oil revenues to match.\n\nThe post-World War Two boom was in full swing and dictator Marcos Perez Jimenez wanted to project an image of a forward-looking nation.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption El Helicoide is the headquarters of the Bolivarian National Intelligence Service (SEBIN)\n\n\"There was real investment in this idea of instant modernity,\" says Dr Lisa Blackmore, co-author of \"Downward Spiral: El Helicoide's Descent from Mall to Prison\" and director of Latin American Studies at the University of Essex in the UK.\n\n\"[Venezuela] is a country that from 1948 entered a period of military dictatorship, and the mandate was: 'We will progress if we build.'\"\n\nEl Helicoide was supposed to be world's first drive-thru shopping centre, with ramps spiralling upwards to the 300 planned boutiques in the complex. It was so big it could be seen from anywhere in the city of Caracas.\n\n\"This is an absolutely iconic building - there is really nothing like it in Latin America,\" Dr Blackmore says.\n\nBut Perez Jimenez was overthrown in 1958 and this ambitious project became a white elephant.\n\nImage copyright Archivo Fotograf\u00eda Urbana / Proyecto Helicoide Image caption This space-age building was carved into the rock with ramps spiralling up past 300 planned boutiques\n\nPlace of fear\n\nFor years the building stood largely empty, but in the 1980s the government started to transfer some state agencies to El Helicoide - the most important being its intelligence services, now known as SEBIN.\n\nSince then it's become a place of fear, used to detain both ordinary criminals and political prisoners.\n\nThe BBC has spoken to former prisoners, their families, legal representatives, NGOs, and also to two former prison guards to build up a picture of life in El Helicoide.\n\nThey have asked us to protect their identities because they fear government reprisals against their families.\n\nRosmit Mantilla arrived at El Helicoide in May 2014. He was one of more than 3,000 people arrested as huge anti-government protests rocked the country.\n\nAged 32, he was already a well-known political activist and outspoken advocate of LGBT rights.\n\nDuring his incarceration he would also be elected to the Venezuelan National Assembly, becoming the country's first openly gay congressman.\n\nImage copyright Reuters Image caption Thousands of Venezuelans were arrested during anti-government protests in 2014 and 2017\n\nEconomic and political turmoil\n\nLife in Venezuela was becoming increasingly difficult, with spiralling inflation, shortages of food and medicine, and public services nearing collapse.\n\nAt El Helicoide, it was a chaotic time. Busloads of prisoners were arriving at the prison every day.\n\nStudents, political activists, and sometimes people, including children, were swept up because they'd been in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n\nMantilla was accused of helping finance the protests - a charge he denies.\n\nManuel is a former prison officer who remembers Mantilla well.\n\n\"[He] was one of those detainees who should never have been there,\" Manuel remembers.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Venezuela's feared secret police are accused of human rights abuses\n\n'Make people afraid'\n\nThe former officer told the BBC: \"By arresting a lot of people, the aim was to make people afraid.\"\n\n\"And I think they did, in a way. Because nowadays, when there is a demonstration or a march, many Venezuelans are afraid because they don't want to be arrested.\"\n\nPrisoners in El Helicoide wait days, weeks, even months to appear before a tribunal.\n\nManuel said: \"SEBIN is an institution whose mission is to produce intelligence and information. But for a while that has not been its role. Its role is to defend a regime, a dictatorship.\"\n\nDuring his two-and-a-half year nightmare, Mantilla says he was afraid all the time.\n\nBut he felt driven to document the torture and cruelty which happened on a daily basis in El Helicoide.\n\nImage caption As the number of detainees rose in El Helicoide, offices, toilets and even staircases were sealed off and converted into cells\n\n'Guantanamo'\n\nWhen Mantilla arrived at El Helicoide in 2014, he recalls there were just 50 detainees. Two years later, he says, there were 300.\n\nAs the number of detainees rose, the guards had to improvise to find more space.\n\nOffices, toilets, staircases and spaces once meant to be exclusive boutiques were sealed off and converted into cells.\n\nThe prisoners had names for them - the Fish Tank, Little Tiger and Little Hell.\n\nBut the worst of all was Guantanamo.\n\n\"It was an old evidence storeroom,\" remembers Victor, another former prison officer at El Helicoide. \"It was about 12 x 12 metres and it was used to hold around 50 prisoners.\"\n\nIt was hot, cramped and airless.\n\n\"No light, no water, no toilet, without sanitation and without beds,\" says Mantilla. \"The walls were stained with blood and excrement.\"\n\nHe told the BBC that prisoners could spend weeks there without showering, urinating in plastic bottles and defecating in plastic bags - which they'd refer to as 'little ships'.\n\nImage caption Prisoners had names for the different cells - and the worst of them was known as \"Guantanamo\"\n\nSystematic torture\n\nBut mistreatment is not the only fear associated with El Helicoide.\n\nAll the former prisoners and guards who have spoken to the BBC about their experiences have described the systematic use of torture by the SEBIN to obtain confessions.\n\nCarlos, a former detainee, told the BBC: \"They covered my head with a bag. I was badly beaten, kicked and subjected to electric shocks to my head, testicles and stomach.\"\n\n\"I felt immense humiliation, impotence, shame and indignation.\"\n\nAnother detainee, Luis, said: \"My head was covered but I heard one SEBIN officer saying: \"Let's get the gun. We are going to kill you.\"\n\n\"They were laughing. \"There's one bullet. Let's see if you're lucky.\" I could feel the pistol against my head\u2026 and hear them pulling the trigger. It happened many times.\"\n\nMantilla says he began to collect prisoners' stories and found the same brutal methods used over and over again.\n\n\"There was a university student who had a plastic bag full of human excrement forced over his head so he had to breathe it in,\" he told the BBC.\n\n\"I heard about people raped with blunt objects, others given electric shocks, and some were blindfolded for days until they would lose consciousness.\"\n\nImage caption Former detainees and both former prison officers say torture is regularly used by SEBIN to obtain confessions\n\nHuman rights abuses\n\nBoth former guards who spoke to the BBC denied ever participating in torture themselves, but both say they had seen it happening.\n\n\"I saw people being beaten, tied up, suspended from a stair rail by their wrists with their feet barely touching the ground,\" says Victor.\n\n\"They used a battery charger with two wires connected to the detainees through their skin to give them electric shocks,\" says Manuel.\n\n\"[Torture] was systematic,\" he adds. \"It was seen as normal.\"\n\nMany of these cases have been documented by international human rights organisations, and in February 2018 the International Criminal Court opened a preliminary examination into crimes and human rights violations committed during the protests.\n\nVenezuela has said that it will cooperate with the investigation.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption President Nicolas Maduro has cracked down on dissent and political opposition\n\nLeft to die\n\nIn October 2016, after spending two-and-a-half years in El Helicoide, Mantilla became so seriously ill that the prison authorities decided to transfer him to a clinic to undergo surgery.\n\nThe procedure was authorised by a judge, but at the last moment the SEBIN intervened. Still in chronic pain, Mantilla was dragged out of the clinic and forcibly returned to El Helicoide, where he was thrown into an isolation cell.\n\n\"It was like having a terminal disease and being locked in a room and told you will never be released. They were sentencing me to death.\"\n\nVideo footage posted on the internet of Mantilla shouting defiantly as he was pushed into a SEBIN vehicle outside the clinic caused an outcry both at home and abroad. International humanitarian organisations led calls for his release.\n\nAfter ten days, the authorities bowed to pressure and Mantilla was transferred first to a military hospital, then to a clinic where he finally had the operation he needed.\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Since his release, Mantilla has been testifying about the horrors he saw first-hand in El Helicoide\n\nHe was formally released from detention in November 2016, and within days was sworn in as a congressman - then he began testifying about what he had seen and experienced in El Helicoide.\n\n\"Crimes against humanity do not have an expiration date [statute of limitations],\" he says.\n\nExile\n\nBut Mantilla never felt safe after his release, and in July 2017, he left Venezuela and moved to France. He was granted asylum in May 2018.\n\nFrom his new home he still follows events in Venezuela closely, and hopes to return one day. His time in El Helicoide continues to cast a long shadow on his life.\n\n\"I never was the same person [afterwards]\u2026 It is complicated because somehow El Helicoide was my home for two and a half years. Although I try to deny it, a lot of me remains inside there.\"\n\nManuel and Victor have also both left Venezuela and are living abroad.\n\nImage caption In May 2018, prisoners rioted in El Helicoide in protest at the conditions, but little seems to have changed\n\nIn May 2018, prisoners in El Helicoide rioted in protest at the conditions. A number of detainees were released and promises were made to improve conditions.\n\nBut according to accounts from those who have been inside the prison, not much has been done to improve the conditions in El Helicoide.\n\nThe BBC repeatedly contacted the Venezuelan authorities and put the allegations about El Helicoide to them.\n\nDespite repeated attempts to contact officials in the Ministry of Communications based in Caracas and to the representatives of the Venezuelan government in the UK the BBC has not received a response to these requests.\n\nExplore El Helicoide with our immersive, interactive documentary.\n\nScenes from within the jail are brought to life using vivid 3D illustrations, based on accounts from former detainees and extremely rare interviews with former security officers.\n\nEach chapter gives you a 360-degree scene to explore, by clicking, swiping or using your phone's gyroscope to open up a window into the jail."

REUTERS/Manaure Quintero\n\nTens of thousands of protesters had taken to the streets to demand that Maduro allow aid into Venezuela, where food and medicine shortages are rife.\n\nGuaido invoked a constitutional provision to assume the presidency three weeks ago, arguing that Maduro\u2019s re-election last year was a sham. Most Western countries, including the United States, have recognized Guaido as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate head of state, but Maduro retains the backing of Russia and China as well as control of state institutions including the military.\n\nAn aid convoy supplied by the United States and Colombia arrived in the Colombian border town of Cucuta last week, where it is being held in warehouses. A Venezuelan opposition envoy has also said Brazil\u2019s government would try to get humanitarian aid to the border.\n\nMaduro has denounced the aid as a U.S.-orchestrated show to overthrow his socialist government and said it will not be let into the country. He has demanded instead that Washington lift economic sanctions that it has ratcheted up in recent weeks.\n\nOn Tuesday, Guaido said he was issuing a \u201cdirect order\u201d to the armed forces to allow the aid in, though so far there are not clear signs the military would disobey Maduro. Guaido did not specify from where aid would enter, but said the opposition would go in a convoy to safeguard the supplies.\n\n\u201cPut yourselves on the side of the constitution, but also on the side of humanity,\u201d Guaido said, in a message directed at the military. \u201cFeb. 23 will be the day for the humanitarian aid to enter Venezuela, so from today we will have to get organized.\u201d\n\nDraped in Venezuelan flags, his supporters carried signs saying \u201cNo more dictatorship,\u201d and \u201cLeave the country, damned tyrant.\u201d One bore a wooden cross to symbolize how Maduro was \u201ccrucifying the Venezuelans,\u201d he said.\n\nJuan Carlos Bolivar said he wanted the government out, adding that his 49-year old sister had uterine cancer and had not been treated for six months because of a lack of medicine.\n\n\u201cWe have brought her home because the hospitals are collapsed.

Her brother, sister and father are among the estimated several million who have emigrated in recent years, fleeing the crisis.\n\nOn Venezuela\u2019s border with Colombia, smaller opposition protests formed. In the town of Urena, across from Cucuta, several hundred people dressed in white danced in the streets, waving flags and chanting profanities against top government officials.\n\n\u201cWe want a prosperous Venezuela, as it was before,\u201d said Mery Marin, a 25-year-old electrician.\n\nSlideshow (19 Images)\n\nMaduro\u2019s adversaries say he has run roughshod over democratic institutions and ravaged the nation\u2019s economy through nationalizations and a corruption-riddled exchange control system.

Guaido has won wide international support and offers amnesty to soldiers who join him.\n\nOn Sunday, Israel and Australia joined the countries backing the 35-year-old leader, and President Donald Trump\u2019s administration said it had accepted Venezuelan opposition figure Carlos Alfredo Vecchio as the country\u2019s diplomatic representative in the United States.\n\nEarly on Sunday, alongside Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino, Maduro watched a platoon of soldiers release volleys of rocket-propelled grenades, machine-gun anti-aircraft fire and tank rounds at hillside targets, the Russian ordnance kicking up clouds of dust at the Fort of Paramacay, an armored vehicle base.\n\nMaduro said the display showed the world he had the backing of the military and that Venezuela\u2019s armed forces were ready to defend the country. Maduro says Guaido is taking part in a coup directed by Trump\u2019s hardline policy advisers, who include Cold War veterans John Bolton and Elliott Abrams.\n\n\u201cNobody respects the weak, cowards, traitors. In this world, what\u2019s respected is the brave, the courageous, power,\u201d Maduro said.\n\n\u201cNobody should even think of stepping on this sacred soil. Venezuela wants peace,\u201d he said. \u201cTo guarantee peace, we have to be prepared.\u201d\n\nFrom Feb. 10 to 15, the military is planning larger exercises that Maduro described as the \u201cmost important in the history of Venezuela.\u201d\n\nThe show of force was accompanied by a government publicity campaign online based on the slogan \u201cAlways Loyal, Never a Traitor,\u201d and followed a high-profile defection by the country\u2019s top military diplomat in the United States on Saturday.\n\nThe Fort of Paramacay, about two hours west of the capital, Caracas, was itself the site of an uprising in 2017, when about 20 soldiers and armed civilians attacked the base. The leader of the attack, which was quickly subdued, said he was calling for a transitional government.\n\nMaduro on Sunday denounced an alleged conspiracy aimed at spreading rebellion in the army, saying thousands of messages were being sent to soldiers every day over WhatsApp and other social media platforms from neighboring Colombia. He later jogged with soldiers and boarded an amphibious vehicle at a navy base.\n\nGuaido also sent a message to the military on Sunday, asking for support and ordering it not to repress civilians during an event in which supporters handed out copies of a proposed amnesty for people accused of crimes in the Maduro government.\n\n\u201cI order you not to shoot,\u201d he said. \u201cI order you not to repress the people.\u201d\n\nAt a U.N.

BOD did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe ruling Socialist Party has over the years launched six \u201ccomplementary\u201d foreign exchange systems meant to improve access to dollars, but those systems all collapsed amid complaints by businesses that they could not obtain the greenbacks they needed.\n\nOn its Twitter page, Interbanex says it is owned by \u201cSpanish investors\u201d and on its website it lists its owner as Interban Exchange. Interban is owned by a Granada, Spain-registered company called Ampajesu and a Barbados-registered company called Bull Equity Management, according to Interbanex."

    "text": "MOSCOW/LONDON (Reuters) - Venezuela\u2019s Nicolas Maduro has sought OPEC support against U.S. sanctions imposed on his country\u2019s oil industry, citing their impact on oil prices and potential risks for other members of the producer group.\n\nVenezuela's President Nicolas Maduro attends a military exercise in Charallave, Venezuela February 10, 2019. Miraflores Palace/Handout via REUTERS\n\nBut a source familiar with the matter said the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, of which Venezuela is a founding member, had declined to make any formal statement. OPEC says it is concerned with oil policy, not politics.\n\nMore than 40 nations including the United States, European powers and most of Latin America have recognized Maduro\u2019s rival, Juan Guaido, as the country\u2019s rightful head of state, following disputed elections last year.\n\nThe request was made in a letter sent to OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo dated Jan. 29 and seen by Reuters, a day after the United States imposed sanctions on Venezuelan state oil firm PDVSA.\n\n\u201cOur country hopes to receive the solidarity and full support of the member countries of OPEC and its ministerial Conference, in the fight we are currently having against the illegal and arbitrary intrusion of the United States in the internal affairs of Venezuela,\u201d Maduro wrote.\n\nI seek \u201cyour firm support and collaboration to jointly denounce and face this shameless dispossession of ... important assets of one of the members of OPEC\u201d, the letter said.\n\nHe wrote that OPEC should help to determine potential solutions based on \u201cthe impact that this action has on the global energy market, and the risk it represents for the other countries ... of this organization\u201d.\n\nThe sanctions on Venezuela have boosted global oil prices, which were trading at around $62 a barrel on Monday. The move has disrupted shipments as more than 20 tankers loaded with Venezuelan oil have been anchored off the U.S. Gulf Coast.\n\nStill, analysts say there is ample spare capacity in other oil producers such as Saudi Arabia plus strategic reserves in consuming nations to compensate for a loss of Venezuela\u2019s exports.\n\nOPEC tends to avoid political disputes involving individual members. Last year, it declined a request from Iran for a discussion of U.S. sanctions against Tehran at a policy-setting meeting.\n\nVenezuela was once a top-three OPEC oil producer but production has been in decline for years following the collapse of the country\u2019s economy.\n\nEnergy research and consulting firm Rystad sees Venezuelan production plummeting to 680,000 barrels per day (bpd) next year, from 1.34 million bpd at the end of 2018. Venezuela pumped 3 million bpd at the turn of the century.\n\nTogether with Libya and Iran, Venezuela is exempt from the latest OPEC-led supply cut due to the involuntary decline in production."

    "text": "CARACAS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House warned traders on Wednesday not to deal in Venezuelan gold or oil following its imposition of stiff sanctions aimed at forcing socialist President Nicolas Maduro from power.\n\nNational security adviser John Bolton tweeted that traders should not deal in gold, oil or other commodities \u201cbeing stolen\u201d from the Venezuelan people, as opponents of Maduro\u2019s government worried the government was surreptitiously moving to ship gold reserves abroad.\n\nThe White House said President Donald Trump spoke to Venezuela\u2019s self-proclaimed interim president, Juan Guaido, by phone on Wednesday, reiterating support for his \u201cfight to regain democracy.\u201d\n\nOn one side of the tussle for control of Venezuela - an OPEC member with the world\u2019s largest oil reserves but in dire financial straits - Guaido and Western backers led by the United States are insisting on an immediate transition and fresh elections.\n\nOn the other, Maduro, with backing from Russia, China and Turkey, says he will remain for his second six-year term despite accusations of fraud in his re-election last year and the economic meltdown.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s struggle to pay its debts even to allies Russia and China amid a sharp drop in oil output has been exacerbated by the new sanctions, which will make it very hard to sell oil to its main client, the United States.\n\nIn that context, the arrival in Caracas of a Boeing 777 plane from Moscow on Monday led to speculation that Maduro\u2019s government was preparing to ship more gold reserves out of the country, following shipments of $900 million of gold to Turkey last year. That was part of a strategy to increase the central bank\u2019s liquidity.\n\nThe flight, operated by Russia\u2019s Nordwind Airlines, left Venezuela at 4:52 p.m., a Reuters witness said. Another Russian-operated flight, a Boeing 757 cargo plane, arrived at the airport an hour earlier via Cape Verde, according to publicly available flight data. There are no routine flights between the two countries.\n\nVenezuelan lawmaker Jose Guerra, a former central bank economist, told the opposition-run National Assembly his understanding was that the Nordwind plane would take some gold reserves to Russia.\n\nHowever, a source with knowledge of the movements said that despite the rumors, gold was not due to leave on either of the Russian planes. The bank did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSources told Reuters that private military contractors who do secret missions for Moscow were in Venezuela last week.\n\nThe recently appointed U.S. envoy for Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, said Washington was looking around the world for more assets of the Maduro government, including gold holdings and bank accounts.\n\nThe Kremlin said this week it expected Venezuela to pay its debts. Russia, which like China has loaned and invested billions of dollars to Venezuela, called on Guaido to drop his demand for a snap election and instead accept mediation.\n\nBut given the failure of previous rounds of dialogue between the government and opposition, including one led by the Vatican, opponents are suspicious, believing Maduro uses them to quell protests and buy time.\n\nVenezuelan opposition leader and self-proclaimed interim president Juan Guaido takes part in a protest against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's government in Caracas, Venezuela January 30, 2019. REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins\n\nGuaido\u2019s envoy to the United States, Carlos Vecchio, said the only dialogue they were interested in would be a negotiation for Maduro\u2019s departure and new elections. Government officials insist the next presidential election will be in 2025.\n\nFRESH PROTESTS\n\nResponding to a call by Guaido, tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets in cities across Venezuela on Wednesday, some waving Venezuelan flags while drivers of cars and buses honked in support.\n\n\u201cI want this government to go, it has been a total humiliation for the country,\u201d said Lucy Cordoba, 51, a government worker in the poor hillside town of Petare at the edge of Caracas, the capital, where she said trash had not been collected for a year and water was scarce.\n\nCordoba said her children were among the more than 3 million Venezuelans who have left the country in the past couple of years. One went to Peru and another to the Dominican Republic.\n\nMore than 40 people have died so far in and around the protests that began a week ago, the U.N. human rights office said. Hundreds have also been arrested, including children.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Trump and Guaido agreed to maintain regular communication after Venezuelan authorities opened an investigation that could lead to Guaido\u2019s arrest. Abrams said action against Guaido would be \u201cfoolish.\u201d\n\nOil prices rose nearly 3 percent on Wednesday, as investors remained concerned about supply disruptions.\n\nSlideshow (23 Images)\n\nBolton, the national security adviser, said he had a \u201cvery productive meeting\u201d on Wednesday with the executive team of Citgo, the U.S.-based refining business of Venezuela\u2019s state-owned oil firm PDVSA, two days after Washington slapped sanctions on PDVSA.\n\nWills Rangel, a board member of PDVSA, told Reuters the company was having problems unloading fuel imports because the sanctions were complicating payments.\n\nMaduro, 56, says Guaido is staging a U.S.-directed coup against him. Maduro is not expected to stand down while he has the backing of senior military officers and has made daily visits to troops.\n\n\u201cDo you want to be a coward?\u201d Maduro yelled in a call and response session with hundreds of soldiers on Wednesday. \u201cNo, president,\u201d they shouted back."

    "text": "(Reuters) - Venezuela plunged deeper into political turmoil this week when Juan Guaido, the leader of the opposition-run congress, declared himself interim president, the boldest challenge to socialist leader Nicolas Maduro\u2019s rule in years.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Demonstrators clash with Venezuelan National Guards during a protest close to one of their outposts in Caracas, Venezuela January 21, 2019. REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins/File Photo\n\nBelow is a timeline on how Venezuela\u2019s political crisis has evolved since the death of socialist leader Hugo Chavez, against a backdrop of hyperinflationary economic collapse in the OPEC nation.\n\nMARCH 2013: Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, who won over the country\u2019s poor with so-called \u201c21st century socialism\u201d during his 14-year rule, dies from cancer at 58. His preferred successor, Vice President Nicolas Maduro, takes office.\n\nAPRIL 2013: In presidential elections for a six-year term, Maduro narrowly defeats opposition candidate Henrique Capriles, who had lost to Chavez by a wider margin the year before. Capriles and allies say the vote was marred by fraud and call on supporters to take to the streets.\n\nFEBRUARY 2014: Venezuelan security forces arrest well-known opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez on charges of fomenting unrest, after a wave of protests known as \u2018The Exit,\u2019 seeking to oust Maduro.\n\nDECEMBER 2015: The opposition Democratic Unity coalition wins control of Venezuela\u2019s legislative body, the National Assembly, for the first time in 16 years, riding a wave of popular discontent with a prolonged recession and rising inflation after oil prices collapsed.\n\nMARCH 2016: Venezuela\u2019s Supreme Court, which has consistently sided with the ruling Socialist Party, announces it is taking over the functions of the National Assembly. The court quickly walks back the decision amid international outcry. But the event sparks months of anti-government protests that ultimately leave more than 100 dead.\n\nJULY 2017: Venezuela calls a referendum, boycotted by the opposition, to approve the creation of an all-powerful legislative body called the Constituent Assembly. It is nominally tasked with rewriting the constitution but quickly takes over crucial legislative functions, leading to accusations that Maduro is undermining democracy.\n\nFEBRUARY 2018: Mediation talks between the government and the opposition collapse amid disagreement over the timing of the next presidential election. The government announces the vote will be held in the first half of the year, and the main opposition parties pledge to boycott.\n\nMAY 2018: Maduro cruises to re-election over a lesser-known opposition candidate amid low turnout and allegations of vote-buying by the government. The domestic opposition, United States and Lima Group of mostly right-leaning Latin American governments say they do not recognize the results.\n\nJANUARY 2019: Maduro goes ahead with his inauguration for a second six-year term, ignoring the advice of several Latin American governments. Juan Guaido, a virtually unknown opposition lawmaker who assumed leadership of the largely toothless National Assembly days earlier, calls Maduro a \u201cusurper.\u201d\n\nJANUARY 2019: Guaido swears himself in as interim president at the opposition\u2019s largest rally since 2017. He is almost instantly recognized as the country\u2019s legitimate president by the United States and many of Venezuela\u2019s neighbors."

    "text": "UNITED NATIONS/CARACAS (Reuters) - The United States on Saturday called on the world to \u201cpick a side\u201d on Venezuela and urged countries to financially disconnect from Nicolas Maduro\u2019s government, while European powers signaled they were set to follow Washington in recognizing Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido as the country\u2019s rightful leader.\n\nIn heated back-and-forth exchanges at a United Nations Security Council meeting, the opposing camp led by Venezuela and Russia, which has invested heavily in Venezuela\u2019s oil industry, accused Washington of attempting a coup, and lambasted Europeans\u2019 demand that elections be called within eight days.\n\nGuaido, who took the helm of the National Assembly on Jan. 5, proclaimed himself interim president on Wednesday. The United States, Canada and a string of Latin American countries recognized the young leader in quick succession. Maduro, who has led the oil-rich nation since 2013 and has the support of the armed forces, has refused to stand down.\n\nBut on Saturday Guaido, 35, gained support from a key military official. Venezuela\u2019s defense attache to Washington, Colonel Jose Luis Silva, told Reuters that he has broken with the Maduro government and recognized Guaido as interim president.\n\nSpeaking at the U.N. meeting, called by the United States, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Maduro\u2019s \u201csocialist experiment\u201d had caused the economy to collapse and reduced ordinary Venezuelans to rooting through dumpsters for food.\n\n\u201cNow it is time for every other nation to pick a side. ... Either you stand with the forces of freedom, or you\u2019re in league with Maduro and his mayhem,\u201d Pompeo told the council. \u201cWe call on all members of the Security Council to support Venezuela\u2019s democratic transition and interim President Guaido\u2019s role.\u201d\n\nPompeo also called on the international community to disconnect their financial systems from Maduro\u2019s government. Washington has signaled it was ready to step up economic measures to try to drive Maduro from power, but on Saturday Pompeo declined to elaborate on any such plans.\n\nBy overcoming opposition to holding the U.N. meeting on Saturday, Washington successfully put the global spotlight on Venezuela as a Security Council problem. However, any council action to address the crisis would be blocked by veto-powers Russia and China, diplomats said.\n\nBritain, Germany, France and Spain all said on Saturday they would recognize Guaido if Maduro failed to call fresh elections within eight days, an ultimatum Russia said was \u201cabsurd\u201d and the Venezuelan foreign minister called \u201cchildlike.\u201d\n\n\u201cEurope is giving us eight days? Where do you get that you have the power to establish a deadline or an ultimatum to a sovereign people?\u201d Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza told the Security Council.\n\nRussia also said military intervention in Venezuela should be avoided at any cost, while Caracas reiterated that its offer of dialogue with President Donald Trump\u2019s government was still on the table despite his administration\u2019s two-year campaign against Maduro.\n\n\u201cIf President Trump, like other presidents of the United States, is in search of war to show he can govern and to stimulate the economy, he won\u2019t get that war in Venezuela,\u201d Arreaza told reporters later.\n\n\u2018FULL SUPPORT\u2019\n\nVenezuela has sunk into turmoil under Maduro with food shortages and protests amid an economic and political crisis that has sparked mass emigration and inflation that is seen rising to 10 million percent this year.\n\nVenezuela's opposition leader Juan Guaido speaks during a rally with members of the Venezuela\u2019s National Assembly regarding an amnesty law project for members of the military, in Caracas, Venezuela, January 26, 2019. REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins\n\nMaduro cruised to re-election last May. The opposition largely boycotted the vote after its senior leaders were blocked from taking part. Critics accused the government of vote buying.

Armed Venezuelan soldiers stood guard at the customs building, pledging to turn back any attempt to cross the border.\n\nThe Cucuta crossing was quiet on Wednesday but Colombian migration officials pulled back a little from the border line, citing the rising tensions with Venezuela.\n\nIn the Venezuelan border town of Urena, residents signed up to unofficial waiting lists for aid.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re desperate.

    "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some U.S. refiners have begun reducing crude processing as crude oil costs have risen following U.S sanctions on Venezuela and as gasoline margins crashed to their lowest in nearly a decade, market sources said on Thursday.\n\nVenezuela ships about 500,000 barrels of crude oil to the United States daily, which refiners use to produce gasoline and diesel. But sanctions announced on Monday by Washington, aimed at driving President Nicolas Maduro out of power after his contested re-election last year, are expected to cut off or dramatically reduce those shipments.\n\nMany U.S. refineries, particularly those in the Gulf Coast, are designed to run heavier grades of crude, a good portion of which comes from Venezuela. However, supplies of heavy crude in the Americas are shrinking due to the sanctions on Venezuela, low production in Mexico and bottlenecked pipelines in Canada.\n\nRefiners have been trying to offset this in recent days by buying U.S. domestic heavy and sour crude grades. Those barrels have gotten more expensive, however, because of the higher demand.\n\nU.S. refiners have the capacity to shift the type of crude they process, but light crude commonly produced in Texas tends to refine into additional barrels of gasoline, for which margins have slumped.\n\nU.S. gasoline margins sank to as little as $3.64 a barrel on Thursday, the lowest since November 2009 and the weakest seasonally since at least 2005, as a domestic glut has weighed on pump prices.\n\nThe reduction in rates are mostly at Gulf Coast plants but some on the East Coast are also affected, market sources said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly a combination of both factors,\u201d said one source at a U.S. East Coast refinery where rates are being cut.\n\nThe extent of the decline in crude runs was not immediately clear. Top U.S. refiner Valero Energy Corp said it has stopped taking Venezuelan crude and is looking to maximize the amount of light crude barrels it can use.\n\nRunning higher amounts of light crude in refinery units designed to break down heavy oil could pose operational difficulties by producing too much gasoline and related fuels, forcing complex refiners to throttle back production, traders and refining consultants told Reuters.\n\nA company spokeswoman declined to comment on crude processing rates.\n\nRefinery maintenance season should help offset some of the impact of shortages in heavy crude supplies, sources said.\n\nValero, for example, is performing overhauls on the crude distillation and coker units at the St. Charles, Louisiana refinery, one of its two plants that routinely process Venezuelan crude. This minimizes the impact of the sanctions, said Senior Vice President Gary Simmons in a conference call with Wall Street analysts.\n\nOne source at a large U.S. Gulf Coast refinery said locking in prices for Canadian heavy crude in advance has helped shield the company from the impact of higher heavy crude costs."
