    "text": "'New York Times' Journalist Describes An 'Almost Unimaginable' Crisis In Venezuela\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ariana Cubillos/AP Ariana Cubillos/AP\n\nVenezuelans have been suffering one calamity after the next, but in recent weeks, much of Venezuela has had to go long stretches without electricity.\n\nNew York Times journalist Nicholas Casey was in Maracaibo, Venezuela, in March when the country was hit by a six-day blackout, considered at the time the worst in Venezuela's history. He says people initially assumed that the outage had been planned and that power would be restored after a few hours. But as hours stretched into days, the country fell into chaos.\n\n\"By the fourth day of the power outage, that was when you started to hear shots getting fired in the street,\" Casey says. \"People were beginning to loot, and the store owners were coming out to defend their stores.\"\n\nAs Andes bureau chief for the Times, Casey has been covering the deepening economic and political chaos in Venezuela. He says the current crisis in the country is \"almost unimaginable.\"\n\n\"This is an oil-producing country. This was one of the most wealthy countries in Latin America,\" he says. \"And now this is a place where there are shortages of food, shortages of medicine. People's daily lives are spent trying to figure out how they're going to get basic things like eggs or coffee.\"\n\nCasey notes that Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who took over after the 2013 death of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, has become increasingly authoritarian, imprisoning political rivals and cracking down on protesters. Maduro has also cut off access for journalists, including Casey.\n\n\"The government doesn't allow me to live in Venezuela anymore. I lived there in 2016, and by the end of the year, my visa was revoked,\" Casey says. \"Their reaction to the stories that I've had \u2014 it's been terrible sometimes. Anything that they see that doesn't line up with their view of what's happening in the country they consider to be a lie.\"\n\nInterview highlights\n\nOn Venezuelans leaving their country because of the chaos\n\nThe U.N. estimates that it's upwards of 3 million people who have left. Now remember, this is a country of 30 million people. So we're talking about 10 percent of the population that has gone. And you see this when you walk around the streets of Caracas, which I have, or Maracaibo, which I did just a few weeks ago. There are areas which are completely empty. You walk down streets and you see that there's two or three people in one house, and then another house is gone, or another house has got a family of what looked like squatters, because they've just moved into the place.\n\nOn what the journey to leave Venezuela is like\n\nSo when you decide to leave, you usually say goodbye to your family, but there's no way of getting a flight, because you can't afford that. So for the most part, people take a bus using the bol\u00edvar, the currency that they have. Now the bol\u00edvars are worth money in Venezuela, but once you cross the border, they are almost worth nothing. So you're essentially bankrupt the moment that you cross into Colombia. ...\n\nAnd at that point you have to figure out how you're going to get somewhere. And that usually means you're going to walk, and often Venezuelans will spend a few days on the border, but then they keep moving, because there are so many Venezuelans in these border towns. There's no jobs for them there, so people set off on foot. They have usually a suitcase, backpacks, but they're trying to travel very light, because they know that they're going to have to carry everything on their backs that they're bringing, and hitching rides occasionally. Sometimes they can save a little bit of money to take a bus ride a short distance, but basically they are trying to put as many footsteps between them and Venezuela as they can. And it can be an extremely long process to try to travel these countries; these are very mountainous countries on foot.\n\nOn how neighboring countries are responding to the millions of migrants\n\nOn one end, these countries are trying to pressure [President] Maduro now to step down, because they know that this migrant crisis is going to get even worse the more politically unstable the country gets. Countries like Colombia understand that Venezuela used to be a country that took their immigrants, especially during the darkest days of the paramilitaries and the guerrilla fighting, but at the same time, they understand they can't take every Venezuelan that comes.\n\nAnd not only that, because of this crisis that's getting worse and worse, because of lack of medicine mainly, people are coming into these countries with diseases that should be controlled in Venezuela \u2014 diseases like diphtheria, malaria, tuberculosis have made a huge comeback in Venezuela. So if you're a neighboring country like Brazil or Colombia or a country like Ecuador or Peru, who are farther away but are also taking immigrants, this is a very scary situation that's right on your doorstep.\n\nOn how President Maduro forced visiting Cuban doctors to use access to medicine as a way to gain votes for Maduro right before an election\n\nThey would start by going house to house to people. ... The way that it was being described to me was that essentially you would start by handing people medications that they needed, especially seeing if they had chronic illnesses that they really needed medication for on a regular basis. And then after you start to get their trust, you would start to bring up Maduro. You'd start to bring up politics. You'd ask them, \"Are you registered to vote?\" And then actually start to make a much harder pitch, like \"You need to vote for Maduro. This is where this medicine is coming from,\" and ultimately at the end of this there would be a threat, which is that \"If you don't vote for Maduro, there is a possibility that you will lose your medication. You will lose your free health care.\" And this is what all of the doctors that I talked to said. ...\n\nThe further along that you got, the less popular that Maduro was becoming, the more that you began to see that he was leaning on this medical system to try to drive votes.\n\nThe further along that you got, the less popular that Maduro was becoming, the more that you began to see that he was leaning on this medical system to try to drive votes. In one election in 2015, there was a doctor who said that when it appeared that the opposition was ahead in a legislative vote, that they actually not only saw the doctors out that afternoon to try to get people to go vote, [but] they also dressed other people up, who were not doctors, as doctors and gave them medicine to go get people to vote, to try to get them to trust these doctors to go and vote.\n\nIn the last elections that were taking place in 2017 and 2018, there was a doctor who was explaining to me about how he was in a small town and wasn't able to give medication to certain patients that were from the opposition and also was told to withhold things like oxygen tanks and not put them out early in the year because they wanted to bring out all the medicine and the oxygen tanks, which were largely in shortage, just before the election, just before people were going to vote, essentially to give the impression that Maduro had solved this medical crisis before people had to go vote for him again.\n\nOne reason to be optimistic that Venezuela will recover\n\nI think there's a way out, and Venezuela, we have to remember, has lots of oil. So no matter how bad the economic crisis is, if there is a way out of the political crisis, there is a way for the country to be able to produce the money that it needs to be able to get back on its feet again. Unlike many other countries in the world, it's extremely blessed to have this natural resource there. But the way out is to have an election. People need to be able to choose who their leader is, because until that can happen, whoever is in charge \u2014 whether it's Juan Guaid\u00f3 saying that he is the president or Nicol\u00e1s Maduro saying that he is the president \u2014 isn't going to have the legitimacy to do anything about it.\n\nVenezuelans ultimately need to be able to choose who's going to be their leader, and they might choose someone again from the left. After all these years, I'm not sure that that's what they're going to do, but they need to be able to have a choice between a number of parties from the opposition and whoever Maduro would put as his candidate, and whoever wins can then take the next steps.\n\nNow, it's not going to be a fast process. This is something that's going to take years, to rebuild this country. But it's not necessarily the level I think always of devastation that makes people feel the worst. It's the fact that things are getting worse every day. Even if things were at a low point in Venezuela, if people could see that there was a reason for hope that things were starting to get better, I think you would start to see people coming back to Venezuela.\n\nAmy Salit and Mooj Zadie produced and edited the audio of this interview.

    "description": "The United States imposed sanctions on Friday on Venezuela's development bank, Bandes, a day after the Trump administration warned there would be consequences for the arrest by Venezuelan authorities of opposition leader Juan Guaido's top aide.",
    "text": "WASHINGTON/CARACAS (Reuters) - The United States imposed sanctions on Friday on Venezuela\u2019s development bank, Bandes, a day after the Trump administration warned there would be consequences for the arrest by Venezuelan authorities of opposition leader Juan Guaido\u2019s top aide.\n\nA man stands outside the Bandes bank headquarters in Caracas, Venezuela March 22, 2019. REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins\n\nThe U.S. Treasury said it was slapping the sanctions on Banco de Desarrollo Economico y Social de Venezuela, including its subsidiaries in Uruguay and Bolivia. It also imposed sanctions on state-owned Venezuelan commercial banks, including Banco de Venezuela and Banco Bicentenario.\n\nIn a statement, Venezuela\u2019s foreign ministry said it \u201cenergetically rejects the unilateral, coercive, arbitrary and illegal measures\u201d taken by the Trump administration. It said the sanctions would affect millions of Venezuelan people and companies who use the banks.\n\nCongress head Guaido, who invoked the constitution to assume the interim presidency in January, has accused Bandes of being used by President Nicolas Maduro\u2019s government to funnel money outside Venezuela.\n\nThe White House said in a statement it was committed to preventing Maduro\u2019s government from stealing Venezuela\u2019s resources and from arresting those pushing for political change.\n\nGuaido\u2019s chief of staff, Roberto Marrero, was detained in a pre-dawn raid on Thursday, sparking vows of reprisals from the United States, which along with most Western countries backs Guaido as Venezuela\u2019s rightful leader.\n\n\u201cThe United States will not tolerate the arrest of peaceful democratic actors, including members of the democratically-elected Venezuelan National Assembly and those Venezuelans working with interim President Juan Guaido,\u201d the White House said in a statement.\n\nIn a tweet on Friday evening, Guaido said he had been informed that Marrero was being transported from jail to court. He demanded Marrero be freed, calling the judges who would hear his case \u201ccomplicit with the dictatorship.\u201d\n\nVenezuelan authorities said on Thursday that an arms cache had been seized from Marrero\u2019s house and accused him of planning attacks against political figures. Guaido said guns had been planted by intelligence agents.\n\nDEBT WITH CHINA\n\nThe U.S. Treasury said Maduro tried to move $1 billion out of Venezuela through Banco Bandes Uruguay in early 2019 as he came under increasing pressure from the United States and other countries in the region to step down.\n\nBandes has received billions of dollars over the past decade from the China Development Bank, in exchange for oil, which the Venezuelan government used to fund infrastructure projects.\n\nUruguay has stayed neutral on Venezuela\u2019s political crisis and has called for dialogue, while China, Russia and regional ally Cuba have backed Maduro.\n\nBut the sanctions on Bandes could test Beijing\u2019s ties with Caracas, since it would impede Venezuela from restructuring its $20 billion debt with China, opposition lawmaker Angel Alvarado said on Friday.\n\n\u201cThat makes it even less likely that China will step in to save Maduro,\u201d Alvarado wrote on Twitter. Guaido and his allies have repeatedly argued that China and Russia are more likely to collect on their loans to Venezuela with Maduro out of office.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nThe sanctions freeze assets belonging to the banks and subsidiaries, and prevent U.S. citizens from any dealings with them. They follow a raft of other sanctions imposed by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump in recent months against Maduro, top government officials, and state oil firm PDVSA.\n\nTrump\u2019s national security adviser John Bolton tweeted earlier on Friday: \u201cBANDES bank is to Venezuela\u2019s financial sector what PDVSA is to its oil sector. This action will severely affect any attempted currency movements by Maduro and his cronies moving forward. Do not test the resolve of this Administration.\u201d\n\nIt said that Visa, Mastercard and American Express would be prohibited from facilitating transactions involving the blacklisted commercial banks, beginning in March 2020. That would complicate basic purchases in a country stricken by hyperinflation and a sixth year of economic contraction.",

And the potential for political violence is ever present.\n\nThat is the quickly deteriorating situation in Venezuela \u2013 where Nicolas Maduro clings to his presidency despite massive American and international pressure for his ouster.\n\nIn Washington, top Trump administration officials sharpened their rhetoric and hinted at a more aggressive posture. Democratic lawmakers prepared a proposal that would bar President Donald Trump from any military intervention without congressional authorization \u2013 fearing that such a step is in the works and that it would be disastrous.\n\nPeople collect water falling from a leaking pipeline along the banks of the Guaire River during rolling blackouts, which affects access to running water in people's homes, offices and stores, in Caracas, Venezuela, March 11, 2019.

Without power, hospitals have been unable to help the sick and dying, water pumps have stopped working, and vandals have ransacked stores and other businesses, according to media reports.\n\nChina offered to come to the rescue of Maduro's socialist government, which has been unable to fix the power grid and is increasingly isolated internationally.\n\n\u201cChina is deeply concerned about this,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said in Beijing on Wednesday. \u201cChina is willing to provide help and technical support to restore Venezuela\u2019s power grid.\u201d\n\nCiting the dire conditions, the State Department withdrew all its American Embassy staff from Venezuela this week. American officials expressed alarm at Maduro\u2019s call Monday for armed gangs, known as \u201ccolectivos,\u201d to rise up and fight the political opposition. The Trump administration has recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as the legitimate president of Venezuela and labeled Maduro a corrupt usurper.\n\n\u201cI call on the colectivos,\u201d Maduro declared, according to The Washington Post. \u201cThe hour of resistance has arrived.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s calling for armed gangs to take over the streets, and it is obviously going to be a great worry to Venezuelans,\u201d Elliott Abrams, the Trump administration\u2019s special envoy for Venezuela, said during a State Department briefing Tuesday. \u201cPerhaps it is a sign of Maduro\u2019s lack of confidence in his own security forces. But it is by definition a breakdown of law and order.\u201d\n\nAbrams and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo suggested this week that the Trump administration was preparing to increase pressure on Maduro. In his announcement that all American diplomats would leave Venezuela, Pompeo said their presence on the ground was a \u201cconstraint on U.S. policy.\u201d The secretary of state did not elaborate, but the remark fueled speculation of military intervention.\n\nAbrams said the administration would impose \u201csignificant\u201d new sanctions on Venezuela in the coming days. He declined to say whether the Trump administration asked the Pentagon to draft military options.\n\nMichael Dobson, a former senior sanctions policy adviser at the U.S. Treasury Department, said the United States is running out of economic tools to squeeze Maduro. The administration has slapped sanctions on the country\u2019s oil sector, which is by far its largest source of revenue. Dobson said the Treasury Department could look at restrictions on Venezuela\u2019s gold industry and some other minerals.\n\n\u201cBut beyond that, there isn\u2019t much left,\u201d said Dobson, an attorney in Washington. \u201cSo it\u2019s largely a waiting game to see, will the military recalculate and see that it\u2019s no longer worth having Maduro in the chair?\u201d\n\nDemocrats fear the Trump administration isn\u2019t interested in waiting.

David Cicilline, D-R.I., the lead sponsor of legislation that would bar the administration from spending any money on military action in Venezuela.\n\n\u201cNot only would military intervention be illegal, it would also come with serious consequences that I fear would not only hurt the Venezuelan people, but also the prospects for democracy,\u201d he said.\n\nMore: Americans should consider fleeing Venezuela as new sanctions loom, State Department says\n\nMore: John Bolton's notes on '5,000 troops to Colombia' spark speculation about military intervention in Venezuela\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/03/14/venezuela-crisis-power-failure-blackout-maduro-guaido-trump-military/3161336002/",

    "description": "At the end of 2015, managers at Rosneft, the Russian state-controlled oil firm, sounded the alarm to their bosses about the company's investments in Venezuela. Rosneft's local partner, Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA, owed it hundreds of millions of dollar\u2026",
    "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - At the end of 2015, managers at Rosneft, the Russian state-controlled oil firm, sounded the alarm to their bosses about the company\u2019s investments in Venezuela. Rosneft\u2019s local partner, Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA, owed it hundreds of millions of dollars, according to internal documents, and there seemed no prospect things would get better.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A general view shows oil treatment facilities at Vankorskoye oil field owned by Rosneft north of Krasnoyarsk, Russia, March 25, 2015. REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin/File Photo\n\n\u201cIt will be like this for eternity,\u201d a Rosneft internal auditor wrote in an email to a colleague in November 2015, complaining there was no progress in getting PDVSA to explain a $700 million hole in the balance sheet of a joint venture.\n\nThe email was among scores of internal Rosneft communications - including presentations, copies of official letters, memos and spreadsheets \u2013 reviewed by Reuters. They cover the firm\u2019s operations in Venezuela between 2012 and 2015.\n\nIt was a period when other international oil companies had either quit the country or were freezing new onshore investments, worried about the policies of the populist socialist administration. But Rosneft, majority owned by the Russian state, doubled down, increasing its stakes in joint ventures with PDVSA and lending more, the documents show. Rosneft was standing by its Venezuelan partner just as the Kremlin was supporting leader Hugo Chavez and his successor as president, Nicolas Maduro.\n\nRosneft has poured around $9 billion into Venezuelan projects since 2010 but has yet to break even, Reuters has calculated, based on Rosneft\u2019s annual reports, its public disclosures and the internal documents.\n\nThe Rosneft documents also reveal:\n\n- The Russians believed they were owed hundreds of millions of dollars from their joint ventures with PDVSA.\n\n- Oil output at the joint ventures was far lower than projected.\n\n- The joint ventures struggled to get hold of basic drilling equipment.\n\n- The Russians believed PDVSA spent millions of dollars from one joint venture on \u201csocial projects\u201d in a remote area where just a few hundred people lived.\n\n- Managers brought the problems to the attention of Rosneft\u2019s chief executive, Igor Sechin, who ordered measures to right the ship.\n\nSince late 2015, the end of the period covered by the documents, some of Rosneft\u2019s problems have eased because it has taken greater shareholder and operational control of its interests. But it remains deeply invested in a company and a country that are in crisis.\n\nThe reason Rosneft kept doubling down on its bet was political, according to two people close to the firm and two others with links to the Venezuela projects. State-owned Rosneft was expected to help prop up Moscow\u2019s allies in Caracas, these sources said.\n\n\u201cFrom the very beginning it was a purely political project. We all had to contribute,\u201d said an executive at a Russian oil firm that partnered with Rosneft in Venezuela.\n\nThe Russian who oversees this strategic business relationship is one of President Vladimir Putin\u2019s closest lieutenants: Rosneft Chief Executive Igor Sechin. The two men have known each other since at least the early 1990s when they worked in the mayor\u2019s office of their native St Petersburg. When Putin went to Moscow to become a mid-ranking official in the presidential administration, Sechin went with him.\n\n\u201cI liked him,\u201d Putin told authors of a book about his life. \u201cWhen I moved to Moscow, Sechin asked to come with me. I took him.\u201d\n\nA bust of Hugo Chavez greets visitors to Rosneft\u2019s offices in Caracas. Sechin often asks to see messages to Maduro before they are sent and adds the phrase: \u201cViva la Revolucion!\u201d a former Rosneft employee said.\n\nRussia views its relationship with Caracas as a way to project power into Washington\u2019s backyard, according to Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at Carnegie Moscow Center, a think tank. Venezuela is a big buyer of Russian weapons. The billions of dollars that Rosneft has invested in Venezuela are an added incentive for Moscow to keep standing by its old ally.\n\nThe story of Rosneft\u2019s troubled partnership comes at a time of deepening crisis inside Venezuela\u2019s giant oil company. The country\u2019s fortunes are closely tied to those of PDVSA, which accounts for 90 percent of the nation\u2019s export revenues. The Rosneft documents provide fresh evidence of long-term mismanagement at PDVSA, helping explain an economic collapse that has left millions struggling to eat.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on March 11 Rosneft continued to buy crude oil from Venezuela and to \u201cthrow a lifeline to the regime.\u201d But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Rosneft was driven by the interests of its shareholders. He denied the Kremlin applied pressure on the firm to invest in Venezuela.\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, Rosneft works as a commercial company in all corners of the world, and it works seeking commercial profit. Therefore this is what they do in Venezuela,\u201d Peskov said in reply to questions from Reuters. \u201cNaturally such major projects are planned for the long term. As for assessments of the profitability of the projects, that\u2019s for the company itself, it\u2019s not a question for us.\u201d\n\nNeither Rosneft nor PDVSA responded to requests for comment for this article.\n\nMISSING PARTS AND MISSED DEADLINES\n\nIn September 2012, at a drilling site in the Orinoco basin, Rosneft\u2019s Sechin filled a jar with crude oil and lifted it into the air to mark the moment his firm joined the ranks of global oil majors. Rosneft was part of a Russian consortium that had acquired a 40 percent share in Venezuela\u2019s Junin-6 oilfield. PDVSA held the other 60 percent.\n\nRosneft already pumped oil from its home fields in Siberia; now it had an overseas presence too, tapping into some of the world\u2019s biggest crude oil reserves on the banks of the Orinoco River. \u201cToday is indeed an historic day,\u201d Sechin told Russian state television at the ceremony to mark the start of production. \u201cRussian companies have now proved their right to be among the leaders of the global oil sector.\u201d\n\nYet soon after Sechin spoke, Rosneft\u2019s foray into the Orinoco basin was running into problems, the documents reviewed by Reuters show.\n\nRelated Coverage Billions spent, little to show\n\nIn November 2012, without asking its Russian partners, PDVSA shut down one of the four drilling rigs at Junin-6 and removed it, a report by the Russian consortium found that year. Local people staged protests that further blocked work. By the end of 2012, just six wells had been drilled, far short of the project\u2019s target of 47.\n\nSpare parts for drilling at Junin-6 were procured from a PDVSA unit called Bariven; but getting equipment from Bariven took 10 to 18 months, according to the documents. Drilling rigs were not operating 37 percent of the time. It took on average 49 days to drill a single well, instead of the anticipated 22 days. PDVSA did not respond to questions about the delays.\n\nJunin-6 production forecasts were cut. Rosneft had said in September 2012 that the field would deliver 20,000 barrels per day by the end of the year. In fact, over the whole of 2012 it yielded only 21,400 barrels.\n\nThree years on, there was little sign of improvement. A Rosneft report covering the first three quarters of 2015 cited well construction \u201cof an unsatisfactory quality\u201d and \u201cnon-optimal trajectories\u201d of wells.\n\nBy the end of 2015, the forecast for peak oil output from Junin-6 had been slashed from 450,000 barrels per day to 250,000 barrels per day. Rosneft\u2019s flagship project had lost its luster.\n\nProblems remain across the Orinoco Basin, according to union leaders who spoke to Reuters. They said that in fields east of Junin, only a handful of the dozens of drilling rigs are working at any one time. Workers complain they don\u2019t have basic equipment such as boots, gloves and helmets. The situation in PDVSA offices is no better. Paper is in short supply. In a vain effort to stem a worker exodus, some HR departments display \u201cNo resignation\u201d signs.\n\nNor is life in Venezuela easy for Rosneft staff. There is often no mains water in the high-end Caracas district where they live, said a Russian who knows families there. A couple of times a week, a water tanker arrives and fills up containers in each apartment.\n\nTwo of Rosneft\u2019s Russian partners in Junin-6 dropped out. The smaller Surgutneftegaz decided to quit the project in November 2012. In December 2014, Russia\u2019s second biggest oil firm, Lukoil, announced it too was dropping out. \u201cLooking back, a lot of people at Lukoil breathed a sigh of relief that they didn\u2019t have to pile billions into Venezuela,\u201d said an executive in the Junin-6 consortium.\n\nSurgutneftegaz did not respond to a request for comment. Lukoil declined to comment.\n\nRosneft bought out the Surgutneftegaz and Lukoil stakes for upward of $300 million, analysts estimated, deepening its exposure to Venezuela. It also acquired a stake belonging to TNK-BP when it purchased the Russian-British firm in a $55 billion deal in 2013. That left Gazpromneft, the oil unit of state-owned gas firm Gazprom, as Rosneft\u2019s sole remaining Russian partner in Junin-6. Gazpromneft did not reply to Reuters\u2019 questions.\n\nRosneft also had four smaller oil projects with PDVSA at that time. All were experiencing problems during this period, the Rosneft internal reports show. Two of the projects, Carabobo and Petromonagas, are in the Orinoco basin; Boqueron is in the east near the Atlantic coast; Petroperija is on the Caribbean coast.\n\nRosneft internal reports from 2015 concluded that crude flow rates envisaged in the contract for the Carabobo fields were \u201cnot achievable.\u201d At Petromonagas, poor quality work caused drilling delays. At Petroperija, production was falling and the joint venture did not have the cash to buy essential pumping equipment. At the Boqueron field, a broken compressor, a device to raise gas pressure, could not be fixed because the joint venture\u2019s bank account was empty.\n\nMONEY TROUBLES\n\nIf getting oil out of its projects was a struggle for Rosneft, so was extracting revenue, the documents show.\n\nThe Russian consortium\u2019s report into operations at Junin-6 in 2012 found that PDVSA had taken $12 million from the Junin-6 budget, without Rosneft\u2019s agreement, for social spending on local people. Only 350 people lived in the area covered by the concession - some 447 square kilometers of hilly scrubland on the northern bank of the Orinoco River.\n\nIn the second half of 2014, Rosneft ordered an audit of the Junin-6 project to check for \u201cdistortion of financial accounting\u201d and \u201cunjustified expenditures.\u201d Reuters couldn\u2019t determine that audit\u2019s conclusions.\n\nRosneft managers ordered the company\u2019s own auditors to investigate money flows between PDVSA and the Petromonagas, Petroperija and Boqueron joint ventures, internal documents relating to the audit show. The audit concluded that PDVSA had understated earnings from Petromonagas oil sales by some $700 million. PDVSA challenged this figure, another document shows, and it was revised to $500 million.\n\nIn a document dated April 30, 2015, Sechin, Rosneft\u2019s chief executive, approved the findings of the audit, and a plan to protect Rosneft\u2019s investments with a series of measures to be implemented by the end of May that year.\n\nThe measures included installing metering stations to monitor how much oil was being pumped to customers, and therefore how much money the ventures should be earning. Rosneft wanted an independent assessor to track how the joint ventures spent money. And it wanted PDVSA to stop hiring its own subsidiaries without signing a contract. Reuters couldn\u2019t determine whether the measures were put into action.\n\nA few months later, in October 2015, Rosneft First Vice President Eric Liron reported to Sechin that there was still disagreement with PDVSA on settling accounts with the joint ventures. Liron wrote in a memo to Sechin: \u201cAs of 15.08.2015, PDVSA is in technical default.\u201d\n\nMonths of efforts to get the money \u2013 in which Rosneft\u2019s Venezuela office and senior executives at headquarters engaged in negotiations with PDVSA officials \u2013 went nowhere. The Rosneft internal auditor stated in the November 2015 email to his colleague that the problem was \u201cunresolved because of the poor financial health of our partner\u201d - a reference to PDVSA.\n\nDiscussing a proposal to push the internal deadline for fixing the problem to a later date, the auditor asked sardonically what would be the point. \u201cWill it (PDVSA) return to health by then, or will it die and the question will no longer be relevant?\u201d he wrote in the same email.\n\nThe auditor left Rosneft in 2016, according to his LinkedIn profile. He did not respond to a message seeking comment.\n\nRosneft was supposed to receive its share of the revenue from oil sales in the form of dividends. As of the fourth quarter of 2015, Rosneft internal presentations showed that the company was owed dividends from three of its joint ventures. The total shortfall was $337 million. The presentations listed among the strategic aims of each of the three projects: \u201cReceiving unpaid dividends\u201d from PDVSA.\n\nSince the period covered by the documents, Rosneft has acted to take greater control of its investments, for example by bringing in its own contractors. Rosneft says PDVSA has paid off much of its debt. In a financial report released on Feb. 5, 2019, Rosneft said the loans it extended to PDVSA, which had totaled about $6.5 billion, were now down to $2.3 billion.\n\nBut serious challenges remain.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nRosneft\u2019s own reports and assessments by energy analysts show the company\u2019s projects in Venezuela are today still producing less oil than originally anticipated, with development plans either shelved or behind schedule.\n\nRosneft\u2019s flagship joint venture in Venezuela, the Junin-6 field, is still stuck in the exploration and test production phase, Rosneft wrote in its 2017 annual report. An executive at Russian partner Gazpromneft went further, saying the project is now \u201ccommercially pointless.\u201d The executive did not elaborate. Rosneft did not reply to Reuters questions about the commercial viability of the project.\n\n(Additional reporting by Oksana Kobzeva, Anton Zverev, Olesya Astakhova, Katya Golubkova, Olga Yagova, Gabrielle Tetrault-Farber, Vladimir Soldatkin, Alexander Ershov, Gleb Gorodyankin, Tatiana Ustinova and Margarita Popova in Moscow; Dmitry Zhdannikov in London; Marianna Parraga in Mexico City; Brian Ellsworth, Vivian Sequera, Alexandra Ulmer and Luc Cohen in Caracas.)",

    "text": "CLOSE Venezuelans continue to struggle under a blackout that has been one of the worst and longest in recent memory, in a country already suffering from serious shortages of food and medicine due to economic crisis. Video provided by AFP Newslook\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela \u2013 The United States announced late Monday that it is pulling the remaining staff from its embassy in Venezuela, citing the deteriorating situation in the South American nation.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the decision as Venezuela struggles to restore electricity following four days of blackouts around the country and a deepening political crisis.\n\nThe U.S. has led an international effort to oust socialist President Nicolas Maduro and replace him with opposition leader Juan Guaido, who vows to hold a new presidential election. Guaido is backed by some 50 countries, while Maduro maintains support from countries such as China, Russia and Cuba.\n\nMaduro had ordered all U.S. diplomats to leave Venezuela in late January because of its support from Guaido, but he retreated and allowed them to stay. The U.S. still withdrew dependents of embassy personnel as well as some of the staff. Pompeo said the remaining diplomats would be out of Venezuela by the end of the week.\n\nMore: Pompeo: Trump is confronting Obama's foreign policy failures in Venezuela, other hot spots\n\nThe move came after another day of chaos as power outages that began Thursday evening continued to cause problems for Venezuelans, leaving them with little power, water and communications.\n\nPeople converged on a polluted river to fill water bottles in Caracas, and scattered protests erupted in several cities\n\nA 3-year-old girl with a brain tumor languished in a Caracas hospital, awaiting treatment after doctors started surgery but then suspended the operation when nationwide power outages first hit on Thursday, said the girl\u2019s fearful mother, who only gave her first name, Yalimar.\n\n\u201cThe doctors told me that there are no miracles,\u201d said Yalimar, who hopes her daughter can be transferred Tuesday to one of the few hospitals in Venezuela that would be able to finish the complex procedure.\n\nThe girl\u2019s story highlighted an unfolding horror in Venezuela, where years of hardship got abruptly worse after the power grid collapsed. On Monday, schools and businesses were closed, long lines of cars waited at the few gasoline stations with electricity and hospitals cared for many patients without power. Generators have alleviated conditions for some of the critically ill.\n\nMaduro said on national television Monday night that progress had been made in restoring power in Venezuela. He also said two people who were allegedly trying to sabotage power facilities were captured and were providing information to authorities, though he gave no details.\n\nGuaido, who heads the opposition-controlled congress, and the United States say Maduro\u2019s claims that the U.S. sabotaged the power grid with a \u201ccyberattack\u201d are an attempt to divert attention from the government\u2019s own failings.\n\nThe blackouts also have hit the oil industry. The country hasn\u2019t shipped $358 million in oil since the power failures started, and \u201cthe whole system is grinding to a halt,\u201d said Russ Dallen, a Miami-based partner at the brokerage firm Caracas Capital Markets.\n\nTwo large tankers are sitting empty at the Jose offshore oil-loading dock, and at least 19 other ships are waiting their turns there, Dallen said.\n\nEngineers have restored power in some parts of Venezuela, but it often goes out again. There have been a few protests in Caracas and reports of similar anti-government anger elsewhere. Guaido tweeted about reports of looting in some cities, but details were difficult to confirm.\n\nSecurity forces in the city of Maracaibo dispersed \u201ccriminals\u201d trying to take advantage of the power cuts, Mayor Willy Casanova told local media. However, numerous videos posted on social media that purported to be from Maracaibo showed crowds roaming the streets and people running from looted, damaged buildings with no police in sight.\n\nIn Caracas, some people reported more sightings of \u201ccolectivos,\u201d a term for armed groups allegedly operating on behalf of the state to intimidate opponents.\n\nSpain\u2019s airline pilots union asked for Spanish airline Air Europa to stop flying to Venezuela after one of its crews was attacked at gunpoint in Caracas. The Sepla union said two pilots and eight more crew members of a flight from Madrid were assaulted on Saturday while going from the airport to their hotel in the Venezuelan capital. None of the crew members was injured.\n\nAir Europa responded by ordering the crews of flights to Venezuela to not spend the night in the country, according to the union.\n\nThe administration of U.S. President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on a Moscow-based bank jointly owned by Russian and Venezuelan state-owned companies, alleging it tried to circumvent U.S. sanctions on the South American country. The U.S. said it is targeting Evrofinance Mosnarbank for supporting Petroleos de Venezuela SA, the state oil company previously targeted by sanctions in January.\n\nEvrofinance said it was carrying out its activities normally despite the announcement and pledged to \u201cmeet its obligations to the clients and partners in full.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. and the other governments that recognize Guaido as Venezuela\u2019s interim president say Maduro wasn\u2019t legitimately re-elected last year because opposition candidates weren\u2019t permitted to run. Maduro says he is the target of a U.S. coup plot.\n\nAssociated Press writer Christopher Torchia contributed to this report.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/03/11/venezuela-us-announces-withdrawal-all-embassy-personnel/3137606002/",

    "description": "In declaring a state of emergency, President Trump is using pre-existing statutory authority to address a legitimate crisis.",
    "text": "CLOSE President Trump declared a national emergency to free up funding for his border wall between the U.S and Mexico. But declaring a national emergency isn\u2019t new -- in fact, the use of emergency powers is older than the country itself. USA TODAY, Just the FAQs\n\nIn declaring a state of emergency, President Trump is using pre-existing statutory authority to address a legitimate crisis, say attorneys general from Texas, Indiana and Louisiana.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s emergency declaration is a proper use of executive power to protect our country\u2019s borders and keep Americans safe. Unfortunately, the crisis at the southern border is one that only the federal government may truly solve. With no solutions coming from Congress, the president is faithfully executing the duties of his office by invoking a law Congress already passed: the National Emergencies Act (NEA).\n\nIn declaring a state of emergency pursuant to the NEA, President Trump is using pre-existing statutory authority to address a legitimate crisis created by lawless conduct at and beyond our southern border. This emergency declaration is not a case of the president relieving himself of restrictions under the law. To the contrary, our president is protecting our country\u2019s borders through means contemplated by Congress and used many times by past presidents for matters less directly threatening than those present on the southern border.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (Photo: Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nOUR VIEW: 41 Republican senators pledge loyalty to royalty\n\nThe NEA gives the president broad authority. In fact, Congress did not define \u201cnational emergency\u201d in the NEA, leaving it entirely at the president\u2019s discretion to determine what constitutes such an emergency. But any president who makes such a declaration must tell Congress the statutory authority upon which he is relying, as President Trump has done here. The president\u2019s action is neither new nor extraordinary.\n\nThe NEA has been used by every president since its adoption in 1976 and has been invoked more than 50 times. Past administrations issued emergency declarations on a wide variety of issues with less direct impact on the safety and security of Americans \u2014 including the sale of blood diamonds (Clinton) and misconduct by multiple foreign governments like Burundi (Obama), South Sudan (Clinton, Obama), Venezuela (Obama) and North Korea (Bush).\n\nMany of these declarations have renewed annually for years or decades. The emergency declaration in response to the Iranian hostage crisis, for example, has been renewed each year since it was declared in 1979. (The hostages were released in 1981.)\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nTrump border emergency is fake and climate crisis is real. Guess which just got funded?\n\nRepublicans are starting to stand up to Trump. But will they reject his national emergency?\n\nSenate Republicans will commit institutional treason if they support Trump's 'emergency'\n\nEveryone knows there is a massive problem with illegal immigration and international organized crime operating on our borders. Congress has been talking about the crisis at the southern border for decades. Up until recently, border security was a bipartisan issue. In 2005, New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson \u2014 a Democrat who served in President Bill Clinton\u2019s Cabinet \u2014 declared a state of emergency at his state\u2019s southern border. In announcing the state of emergency, Richardson criticized the \u201ctotal inaction and lack of resources from the federal government and Congress\u201d in helping protect his state\u2019s residents along the border. In describing the crisis, the 2005 declaration stated New Mexico has been \u201cdevastated by the ravages and terror of human smuggling, drug smuggling, kidnapping, murder, destruction of property and the death of livestock.\u201d\n\nObama unlawfully used executive power\n\nAs state attorneys general, we are the chief legal officers of our states, with the duty to defend our sovereigns from federal overreach. We have been quick to challenge executive actions that exceed the president\u2019s lawful authority.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s emergency declaration to address the crisis at the southern border is much different than the kinds of executive action we challenged in the past. Unlike President Barack Obama, who unlawfully used executive power to create new laws or rewrite laws Congress enacted, President Trump is lawfully using executive power to address a crisis worsened by congressional inaction. That is a stark difference but not the only one: This use of executive action is part of the core duties of the president \u2014 to protect the borders of our country. In doing so, he properly invoked power that Congress expressly granted him to deal with a national crisis.\n\nAstonishingly, multiple meritless complaints have been filed against the president\u2019s emergency declaration. This is the first time ever in the history of the NEA that the president has faced a court challenge. In four decades and more than 50 emergency declarations, only now has anyone challenged the president\u2019s determination that an emergency exists.\n\nThe facts support Trump \u2014 Congress should, too\n\nThe funding sources proposed by the president are also proper. Out of the $8 billion needed to address the crisis on the southern border, $4.5 billion does not depend on any declaration of a national emergency: $1.375 billion has already been appropriated by Congress, $600 million comes from the Treasury Department\u2019s asset forfeiture fund and $2.5 billion stems from the Pentagon\u2019s drug interdiction program fund, which specifically contemplates building a barrier that prevents drugs from crossing a border.\n\nIt is only the $3.6 billion from the Pentagon\u2019s military construction project budget that requires a national emergency declaration. Even then, the only funds that can be used are funds that have been appropriated but not otherwise obligated. Therefore, any argument that any particular state would otherwise have gotten some of these funds for military construction projects in their states is entirely speculative.\n\nThe facts matter \u2014 these facts show the president has acted lawfully and within the scope of discretion Congress and the people vested in him. Congress should support President Trump.\n\nKen Paxton is attorney general of Texas and chairman of the Republican Attorneys General Association.

The state-owned power operator blamed the outage on \u201csabotage\u201d at the Guri Dam, a hydroelectric station vital to Venezuela\u2019s power grid.\n\nElectricity outages are not uncommon for the country, where the economy is collapsing and there are food and medicine shortages. Critics have said corruption and lack of infrastructure investment left Venezuela\u2019s power grid in poor condition.

    "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - For all the Brexit tumult, one thing that has remained strong and stable \u2014 to borrow a phrase Prime Minister Theresa May once used to describe her leadership \u2014 is demand for British government debt.\n\nFILE PHOTO: An anti-Brexit protester demonstrates outside the Houses of Parliament in London, Britain, April 3, 2019. REUTERS/Hannah Mckay/File Photo\n\nPolitical crises have pushed up borrowing costs in euro zone countries such as Greece and Italy in recent years.\n\nIn Britain, Parliament has rejected May\u2019s divorce deal three times and failed to back an alternative, risking a chaotic no-deal Brexit as soon as April 12, although May on Tuesday announced cross-party talks to break the impasse.\n\nBut interest rates on Britain\u2019s roughly 1.5 trillion pounds ($2.0 trillion) of government bonds, known as gilts, have fallen.\n\nThe main reason is that gilts, representing one of the world\u2019s major government bond markets, are influenced mostly by the ebbs and flows of the global economy and financial markets.\n\nBut other factors are at work too.\n\nBelow is a look at some of the reasons for the strong demand for gilts in the face of Britain\u2019s political chaos.\n\nGLOBAL SLOWDOWN\n\nThe central banks of the United States and the euro zone recently rowed back on their plans to remove the stimulus they have been providing since the global financial crisis, reflecting worries about a slowdown in the global economy.\n\nThis has been a major factor in driving gilt yields lower and they have fallen this year in step with those of other major government bonds across the Group of Seven rich countries.\n\nFor a graphic on G7 benchmark 10-year government bond yields, see - tmsnrt.rs/2CRlp8T\n\nLast week the 10-year gilt yield fell below 1 percent for the first time in 18 months, although it rebounded to 1.07 percent on Wednesday as investors judged May\u2019s latest plan as likely to cut the risk of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nSTILL A SAFE HAVEN\n\nBritish government bonds retain high credit ratings even after losing their top-notch triple-A grades as Britain\u2019s economy and public finances struggled to recover from effects of last decade\u2019s global financial crisis.\n\nPart of gilts\u2019 appeal is Britain\u2019s track record, stretching back hundreds of years, of not defaulting on its debt, bolstered by the fact it issues its own currency.\n\nAlthough British government debt levels rocketed in the aftermath of the crisis, gilts are still regarded by investors as a safe place to store money when the going gets tough.\n\n\u201cUltimately, there\u2019s someone always willing to buy the debt, unless you make a complete hash of it \u2014 we\u2019re talking the Venezuela, Turkey arena,\u201d said Marc Ostwald, chief economist at ADM Investor Services.\n\nBIG DOMESTIC OWNERSHIP\n\nBritish domestic investors like pension funds and insurance firms, plus the Bank of England, account for the vast majority of gilt holdings, cutting the risk that a sell-off from foreign owners of gilts would wreak havoc in the market.\n\nForeign owners accounted for 25 percent of British government debt securities in 2017, compared with 30 percent in Italy and 47 percent in France, according to Eurostat data.\n\nLONG IN THE TOOTH\n\nWhen a government bond matures, meaning the government repays bondholders what they have lent it, they have an opportunity to move their money elsewhere if they choose.\n\nThe average maturity for gilts is much longer than for equivalent European government bonds, meaning investors have fewer opportunities to move out of British debt \u2014 another factor that adds to the relative stability of gilts.\n\nThe average maturity for British bonds is 14.9 years, compared with 7.5 in France, 6.9 in Italy, and 6.3 in Germany, according to European Central Bank data.\n\nBREXIT EFFECT? LOOK TO THE FTSE\n\nGilts\u2019 current strength also probably reflects the relatively poor performance of the British stock market, which along with the pound has borne the brunt of shifts in investor appetite in response to Brexit developments.\n\nAlthough the FTSE 100 is up 10 percent year-to-date, it is vying with Spain\u2019s IBEX as the worst performer among the major European bourses in 2019.\n\nSome of the money that could have sent British stocks higher probably found its way into gilts.\n\n\u201cPeople say \u2018what about Brexit?\u2019, but investors say \u2018where else am I meant to invest my money\u2019?\u201d Ostwald said.\n\nFor a graphic on Performance of European stock markets in year-to-date, see - tmsnrt.rs/2CSg4OK",

    "description": "Pompeo took the opportunity to say many issues weren't the creation of the Trump administration.",
    "text": "CLOSE US President Donald Trump said on Thursday he doesn't think North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was involved in the mistreatment of American college student Otto Warmbier, who died after being detained in the isolated country. (Feb. 28) AP\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Secretary of State Mike Pompeo bristled in an exclusive interview with USA TODAY when asked about some of the president\u2019s recent statements and major policies, seeking instead to highlight a series of domestic trips the top diplomat is taking to Iowa, Kansas and Texas.\n\nPompeo was confrontational when pressed about the failed North Korea negotiations, the status of China trade negotiations, and the possible political nature of his own domestic travel.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a ridiculous statement,\u201d Pompeo said Saturday when asked if his travel to Iowa, which hosts the first-in-the-nation presidential caucus, was tied to President Donald Trump's 2020 re-election campaign.\n\nPompeo also repeatedly argued that said many of global challenges the Trump administration now faces were created by President Barack Obama's inaction or misguided foreign policies. \u201cEach of the problems that we\u2019ve spoken about today ... the Obama administration did nothing to address any of them,\" Pompeo said.\n\nHere's what Pompeo had to say about pressing international issues:\n\nOtto Warmbier tragedy: Did Kim know?\n\nOtto Warmbier during a press conference on Monday, Feb. 29, 2016, in Pyongyang, North Korea. (Photo: Kim Kwang Hyon, AP)\n\nDid North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un know about the mistreatment of American college student Otto Warmbier, who was held for 15 months in North Korea and died shortly after his release? Trump said he believed Kim when Kim said he didn't know.\n\nPompeo seemed annoyed by questions about Trump's statements. Pressed about Kim's personal responsibility and whether Kim knew about Warmbier\u2019s case, Pompeo fell silent before saying he had answered the question and been \u201cvery patient\u201d with that line of inquiry.\n\nWhat Pompeo did say: \u201cThe North Korean regime is responsible for the death Otto Warmbier and the humanitarian violations that are continuing to take place.\u201d\n\nExperts say it's not plausible that Kim didn't know about Warmbier.\n\nNorth Korea summit: Stalemate or not?\n\nPompeo also rejected the idea that Trump\u2019s summit in Hanoi with the North Korean dictator had resulted in stalemate, and he said the Trump administration would not resume joint military exercises with South Korea.\n\nThe secretary reacted angrily when asked about the North Korean foreign minister's statement, made hours after the talks dissolved, that the offer Kim made in Hanoi was final.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what the North Koreans said,\u201d Pompeo responded. \u201cDon\u2019t say things that aren\u2019t true. ... Show me the quote from the North Koreans that said this was their one and only offer. Where\u2019d you get that?\u201d\n\nAfter he was read a quote from Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho \u2013 in which he said \u201cour proposal will never be changed\u201d \u2013 Pompeo was quiet for about six seconds. Then he countered, \u201cWhat they said is they\u2019re prepared to continue conversations with us and that\u2019s what we intend to do.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald J.

(Photo: LUONG THAI LINH, EPA-EFE)\n\nVenezuela's political crisis\n\nPompeo did not answer a question about whether the U.S. was helping opposition leader Juan Guaido return to Venezuela. The Trump administration is pushing for the ouster of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and has recognized Guaido as the country's legitimate leader.\n\nBut Maduro has maintained his grip on power; Guaido returned to Venezuela on Monday. The Maduro regime has threatened to arrest him.\n\nPompeo said the Trump administration has made progress in addressing the political and humanitarian crisis there. \"We\u2019re working to help the duly elected interim president Guaido assert his power and get food and humanitarian aid assistance in to starving people,\" he said.\n\nAfghanistan's future\n\nU.S. soldiers from NATO look on as U.S. flag flies in a checkpoint during a patrol against Islamic State militants at the Deh Bala district in the eastern province of Nangarhar Province in Afghanistan on July 7, 2018. (Photo: WAKIL KOHSAR, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe Trump administration is negotiating a peace deal with the Taliban that could bring an end to the 17-year war there. The Taliban have agreed in principle not to allow Afghanistan to be used as a haven for terrorists plotting future attacks against the U.S.\n\nBut Afghan women are terrified that if the Taliban return to power, they will lose all the rights they've gained under the new Afghan government. The Taliban barred girls from attending school, forbade women from appearing in public unless escorted by a man and beat women who did not comply with their strict edicts.\n\nAsked about those fears, Pompeo said, \u201cWe are working to get a reconciliation agreement that will be good for every Afghan \u2013 men, women, children.\"\n\nReaching a trade deal with China\n\nPompeo said the Trump administration is making good progress in its trade negotiations with China, which touch on everything from market access to intellectual property theft. He sharply rejected any suggestion that the talks were taking a long time to produce a deal, pivoting again to Trump's predecessor, President Obama.\n\n\"It\u2019s just been two years that this administration\u2019s had the opportunity to course correct from the disastrous policies that the Obama administration put in place to allow China to steal the heartbeat of agricultural America,\" he said. \"The Chinese were stealing us blind.\"\n\nTrump recently said the trade negotiations have been \"very productive,\" and he agreed to delay a threatened increase in tariffs against China. Pompeo echoed that assessment.\n\nMore: President Trump announces delay in tariff hikes against China, plans summit at Mar-a-Lago\n\nMore: Afghanistan talks sound a lot like 'peace with honor' ending to the Vietnam War\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/03/04/pompeo-interview-north-korea-venezuela-china-trade-otto-warmbier-trump-policies/3053768002/",

    "text": "CLOSE Speaking to reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort, President Donald Trump said there's \"a very good likelihood\" that he'll be closing the U.S. southern border next week if Mexico does not immediately stop illegal immigration. (March 29) AP, AP\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The United States is halting humanitarian funding to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, the State Department confirmed on Saturday.\n\nThe move comes just days after President Donald Trump warned of a new migrant caravan heading toward the southern U.S. border and issued warnings that he planned to close the U.S.-Mexico border next week if Mexico did not do more to stop caravans of migrants, many fleeing Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, from attempting to gain entry into the U.S.\n\n\"At the Secretary\u2019s instruction, we are carrying out the President\u2019s direction and ending FY 2017 and FY 2018 foreign assistance programs for the Northern Triangle,\" a State Department spokesperson told USA TODAY. \"We will be engaging Congress as part of this process.\"\n\nTrump has long threatened to cut off humanitarian aid to the countries, including before the 2018 midterm elections when he held a slew of rallies and warned of an \"invasion\" of migrants from the countries. He recently declared a national emergency at the border to secure funding for a proposed wall, despite Congressional opposition.\n\nMore: Trump threatens to seal the border if Mexico doesn't 'immediately stop' immigrants\n\nMore: How US foreign policy in Central America may have fueled the migrant crisis\n\nOn Friday, the president threatened to close the U.S.-Mexico border if Mexico didn't stop undocumented migrants from coming.\n\n\"There\u2019s a very good likelihood that I\u2019ll be closing the border next week,\" Trump told reporters gathered at his Florida resort. \"I will close the border if Mexico doesn\u2019t get with it.\"\n\nHistorically, the United States has viewed foreign aid programs to Central American countries as a vital component of stabilizing the countries, potentially halting the flow of immigrants seeking to migrate to the United States. Under Trump, aid to the countries had already plummeted.\n\nThe U.S. provided about $131 million in aid to Guatemala, $98 million to Honduras, and $68 million to El Salvador in 2016, according to Reuters. The following year the funding fell to about $69 million for Guatemala, $66 million for Honduras and $46 million for El Salvador.\n\nIn April, Trump also threatened to withdraw aid from Honduras a caravan of migrants fled the country. The group, which grew to as many as 1,600 migrants, grew smaller as it moved north. By the time they reached Tijuana, on the Mexican side of the southern U.S. border, only about 300 migrants remained.\n\nHonduras' murder rate has declined in recent years but it still had the fourth-highest rate among Latin American nations in 2017 at 42.8 per 100,000 residents, according to Insight Crime. Only Venezuela, El Salvador and Jamaica suffered more murders in the region that year.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, 66 percent of Hondurans live in poverty and about one out of five Hondurans in rural areas live on less than $1.90 a day.\n\nMore: 'We\u2019ve never seen anything like this': As Trump threatens to close border, migrants overwhelm Texas cities\n\nLong before Trump took office, the United States had a checkered history of involvement in Central America \u2013 and some say American foreign policy in the region caused the instability and inequality at the root of the current crisis.\n\nThere was the CIA\u2019s covert operation to overthrow Guatemala\u2019s democratically elected president in 1954. And America\u2019s intervention in El Salvador\u2019s civil war in the 1980s. And the Obama administration\u2019s refusal in 2009 to label the ouster of Honduras\u2019 president a military coup \u2013 even though soldiers dragged him out of bed in the middle of the night and sent him into exile in his pajamas.\n\nJeff Faux, a distinguished fellow at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, said the decades-long history of American intervention has left Central American governments weak and fragile while empowering oligarchs and drug cartels, which has, in turn, fueled the corruption and gang violence that drives residents to flee.\n\nContributing: John Fritze, Deirdre Shesgreen and William Cummings\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/03/30/united-states-cuts-aid-guatemala-honduras-el-salvador-migrant-crisis/3320401002/",

    "description": "Yesterday, Google announced it\u2019s teaming up with Cuba\u2019s telecommunications monopoly, ETECSA, in order to bring faster Internet access to the island.

    "text": "Yesterday, Google announced it\u2019s teaming up with Cuba\u2019s telecommunications monopoly, ETECSA, in order to bring faster Internet access to the island. The news is no doubt a relief for Cuba\u2019s citizenry, who have to endure high Internet costs and excruciatingly slow speeds. These factors combine to give Cuba one of the lowest Internet penetration rates in the Western hemisphere.\n\nBut why is a middle-income country, situated within spitting distance of the United States, a digital dead-zone? The answer is actually fairly interesting and involves a number of factors.\n\nDude, where\u2019s my cables?\n\nThere\u2019s a massive network of undersea fiber optic cables in the ocean. These connect disparate locales, ferrying bits and bytes at the speed of light. Just to give you a sense of how important these are, according to a 2017 report published by the UK-based think tank Policy Exchange, submarine cables were responsible for carrying around 97 percent of the world\u2019s communication traffic.\n\nMost countries with a maritime border are connected to several undersea cables. The first reason for this is redundancy: if one breaks (which happens often), there\u2019s a backup. More cables means you\u2019re able to transmit more traffic, too, which is essential if you\u2019ve got a data-hungry populace.\n\nCuba is connected to just one cable. In 2013, the country activated a $70 million, 1,600 kilometer (994 mile) pipeline to Venezuela. Prior to that, it relied on excruciatingly expensive satellite connections, which cost a small fortune to operate, and offered limited bandwidth. This all but kept the Internet out of the hands of everyone, except a handful of elites.\n\nYou know, government officials. Foreign diplomats. Tourists.\n\nSo, now you\u2019re probably wondering why Cuba\u2019s so behind the times. The answer, of course, involves politics.\n\nEmbargo Shmembargo\n\nFor a tiny country of just over 11 million in the Caribbean, Cuba played an oversized role in the Cold War. Remember the Cuban Missile Crisis? The clue is in the name.\n\nThe past 60 years of Cuba\u2019s history has been centered around a deep-seated animosity with the nearest superpower \u2013 the US. In an attempt to stymie the only outpost of communism in North America, America placed Cuba under a crushing embargo that prevented it from doing business with the outside world.\n\nFor a really long time, American companies couldn\u2019t sell telecommunications equipment to Cuba. It\u2019s worth remembering that American firms dominate the tech world, and it\u2019s almost impossible to have any sort of infrastructure without any US-origin parts (although is likely getting easier, thanks to the rise of China as a tech giant in its own right).\n\nThankfully, that restriction was lifted by President Obama in 2009, as tensions between the two countries thawed. It remains to be seen what changes Trump\u2019s presidency will mean for the effort to connect Cuba to the Internet, however.\n\nDon\u2019t forget authoritarianism\n\nIt\u2019s not just America. As an authoritarian regime with an abysmal human rights record, Cuba\u2019s got an incentive to keep its citizens offline, and regularly harasses and arrests digital dissidents. Reporters Without Borders calls the nation an \u201cInternet Enemy,\u201d putting in the same list as North Korea, Syria, and Iran.\n\nThe censorship manifests itself in a really interesting way. While there\u2019s not much actual site-level blocking, Cuba does surveil its citizens online. You could also make a convincing case that the country has deliberately rationed access in order to keep it out of the hands of the masses.\n\nIn December 2009, Cuba arrested a US citizen, Alan Gross, after he smuggled Internet equipment into the country, destined for the nation\u2019s tiny Jewish community. Gross would spend six years incarcerated before eventually being released in 2014.\n\nAnd here we are.\n\nLet\u2019s go back to Google. There\u2019s currently no hard timeframe for when Cubans will get faster access to the likes of YouTube, Search, and Google Play. According to Reuters, engineers from Google and ETECSA will work together to find a solution. Overall, the details are thin on the ground, but it seems like Google\u2019s advocating for a \u201cpeering agreement,\u201d where ETECSA has a direct line to Google\u2019s infrastructure.\n\nThis would lower costs, as Cubans wouldn\u2019t have to pay in order to access Google via an intermediary network. It\u2019ll also offer markedly faster access. However, it\u2019ll undoubtedly require new submarine infrastructure. Cuba will either have to connect to one of Google\u2019s \u201cpoints of presence.\u201d The nearest ones to Havana are in Florida, Mexico, and Colombia.\n\nBut make no mistake, solving Cuba\u2019s Internet woes won\u2019t just be solved by thicker pipelines and faster routers. This isn\u2019t just a technical problem. A good deal of diplomacy is required, too.\n\nGiven the history of the country, you can be forgiven for wondering how we ended up in a position where a communist monopoly is teaming up with Google. The reality is that Cuba\u2019s arrival on the Internet stage may have been severely delayed, but it\u2019s certainly been rapid.\n\nInternet caf\u00e9s were followed by public Wi-Fi hotspots, and since December, Cuba\u2019s had widespread mobile Internet. Around two million people, or about 18 percent of the country, now pays for 3G internet, which they access through their smartphones. And that\u2019s before we get into the phenomenon of mesh networks and \u201cel paquete semanal\u201d \u2013 shared USB drives packed with clandestine content, like cached websites and telenovellas.\n\nUltimately, this story tells us that the Internet is a bell that cannot be un-rung. If you give people a sip, they\u2019ll want to drink the whole glass.\n\nTNW Conference 2019 is coming!

But the meetings, more than anything else, turned into a love fest between the leader known as \u201cBrazil\u2019s Trump\u201d and the real thing.\n\nFinally together in person, the men in charge of two of the world\u2019s four largest democracies spent most of Tuesday afternoon showering each other with the kind of doting praise that has become a regular feature of Trump\u2019s time with foreign leaders who share his authoritarian impulses.\n\n\u201cHe has done a very outstanding job \u2015 ran one of the incredible campaigns,\u201d Trump said with Bolsonaro by his side. \u201cI think Brazil\u2019s relationship with the United States, because of our friendship, is probably better than it\u2019s ever been by far.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have always admired the United States of America,\u201d Bolsonaro said an hour later, at a joint news conference in the Rose Garden, his eyes wandering to his left, where Trump was standing. \u201cAnd this sense of admiration has increased since you took office.\u201d\n\nBolsonaro and Trump have many things in common \u2015 they are anti-immigrant and anti-LGBTQ, they share a history of making deeply racist and sexist remarks, and neither can quite hide their disdain for the basic tenets of democracy as they rail against \u201cfake news,\u201d praise authoritarian leaders and, in Bolsonaro\u2019s case, openly pine for the return of military rule to Brazil.\n\nWhat connects it all, though, and what has fostered the sort of bromance that took root last year and fully bloomed this week in Washington, is the sense of masculine, tough-guy aggrievement that fuels them both \u2015 the defiant but insecure machismo that flows through everything they do.\n\nIt was on full display throughout Bolsonaro\u2019s time in Washington.\n\n\u201cMay I say that Brazil and the United States stand side-by-side in their efforts to ensure liberties and traditional family lifestyles and God, our creator,\u201d Bolsonaro said during the White House press conference.\n\n\u201cAnd against gender ideology or politically correct attitudes,\u201d he added, jamming his deep-rooted opposition to efforts to promote equality for women and LGBTQ people into one of the biggest moments of his visit.\n\nTrump, who once proclaimed himself \u201ca real friend\u201d to the LGBTQ community, didn\u2019t bat an eye. Instead, he praised Bolsonaro for lumping a distaste for \u201cfake news\u201d into the group of things both countries detest.\n\nThat both Trump and Bolsonaro are thrice married apparently does not contradict their version of what constitutes \u201ctraditional family lifestyles\u201d \u2015 instead it seems to reinforce it. In an impromptu press gathering after the White House visit had concluded, Bolsonaro told reporters that he and Trump had joked about the relatively young ages of their current wives (first lady Melania Trump is nearly 25 years younger than her husband; Jair Bolsonaro is 30 years older than his wife Michelle).\n\n\u201cI called him a young man and I spoke to a translator \u2015 careful what you\u2019re going to say now \u2015 why I\u2019m calling him a young man: We\u2019re the age of the woman we love,\u201d Bolsonaro said.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t his first effort at humor of the week.\n\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images \"I have always admired the United States of America, and this sense of admiration has increased since you took office,\" Bolsonaro told Trump during a White House visit on Tuesday.\n\nDuring a Monday speech at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Bolsonaro told the American business community that his initial meeting with his economic minister, the University of Chicago-trained economist Paulo Guedes, resulted in \u201clove at first sight.\u201d\n\n\u201cEconomically, I mean,\u201d Bolsonaro cracked, drawing laughter from the crowd.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a homophobe, by the way,\u201d Bolsonaro, who has said he would rather have a dead son than a gay one, added. He later insisted the same during an interview on Fox News, adding there that he is not racist or xenophobic, either.\n\nGuedes got in on the act, too: The reason Brazil is suffering from high rates of violence and a sluggish economy, he said at the Chamber event, is that \u201cnobody had balls\u201d enough to fix the problems.\n\n\u201cSo, we got a guy who has balls,\u201d Guedes said. (When it comes to violence, Bolsonaro\u2019s main balls-informed plan has been to give one of the world\u2019s deadliest police forces even more power to kill on sight.)\n\nThat tough-guy image is central to both Bolsonaro and Trump\u2019s appeal \u2015 to each other and their most hardcore supporters.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign and subsequent presidency have been defined by his appeals to aggrieved white men who feel like their America has been taken from them by immigrants, black people, LGBTQ communities, women and the political leaders who seek to advance the rights of all of them.\n\nBolsonaro, meanwhile, ran for office promising to restore Brazil \u201cfor the Brazilians\u201d \u2015 by which he primarily meant those Brazilians who felt their own grip on their Brazil had been loosened by years of leftist governments that pushed affirmative action quotas and other policies aimed at improving life for some of Brazil\u2019s most marginalized peoples. (\u201cBolsonaro\u2019s campaign slogan could well be \u2018It\u2019s not your fault,\u2019\u201d Harvard professor Bruno Carvalho wrote last July. \u201cAs if to say, \u2019If they weren\u2019t ruining everything, this country would be great.\u2019\u201d)\n\nThat\u2019s not just conjecture: Researchers found in 2016 that the more people believed in \u201cmasculine honor beliefs\u201d \u2015 supporting male aggression, physicality and bravery \u2015 \u201cthe more positive they felt about Trump.\u201d Others have suggested that Trump support rose in areas that showed higher levels of \u201cfragile masculinity.\u201d\n\nThe appeal of figures like Trump and Bolsonaro as mythical, comically masculine figures is evident in the sort of artwork and memes that each has inspired, and that circulated again around their meeting. In them, they are painted as muscle-bound, G.I. Joe-like superheroes, ready to save the world from the perceived scourge of LGBTQ people, feminism, immigrants and the \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d that has eroded the world in which men can just be men.\n\nWhat's so funny about this sort of right-wing meme is the suspension of belief its propagators have to have about the bodies of their leaders pic.twitter.com/jwJbdPtglE \u2014 Ishaan Tharoor (@ishaantharoor) March 19, 2019\n\nComic relief aside, that machismo has directly informed the way Trump and Bolsonaro have governed.\n\nBoth have stacked their governments with military officials that project the sort of strong, honorable image neither Bolsonaro nor Trump is capable of pulling off themselves. Bolsonaro\u2019s 23-member cabinet includes just two women, and one of them \u2015 Minister of Human Rights, Family and Women Damares Alves \u2015 has embraced Bolsonaro\u2019s fight against \u201cgender ideology\u201d with a rigid traditionalism: \u201cAttention, attention! It\u2019s a new era in Brazil: Boys wear blue and girls wear pink!\u201d Alves tweeted in January.\n\nTrump has routinely targeted women and minority groups not just with rhetoric but with policy decisions too, and Bolsonaro has followed a similar path. His first actions as president were aimed at reducing rights and protections for LGBTQ people, black Brazilians and indigenous communities, all of which are already subject to high rates of violence across Brazil.\n\nGovernment-by-machismo also tends to lead to more hardline policies, and more aggressive support for them, when it comes to public security and foreign policy. In Brazil, Bolsonaro has supported shoot-to-kill policing in order to address violence, while Trump\u2019s approaches to immigration and, right now, his efforts to oust Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro \u2015 potentially with military force \u2015 give off the same tough-man vibe both leaders try so hard to project. (During his visit, Bolsonaro said he supported Trump\u2019s border wall with Mexico and criticized immigrants; he also refused to take military support for the U.S. in Venezuela off the table.)\n\nTrump and Bolsonaro\u2019s meeting came at an important time for each, with both of the leaders in need of each other\u2019s validation. Their governments are both flailing thanks to allegations of corruption, and their approval ratings and confidence in them to lead their respective countries have plummeted \u2015 in Trump\u2019s case to near its lowest point and in Bolsonaro\u2019s from the heights he enjoyed the day he took office just two months ago.\n\nBut their bromance was comforting, a chance to look in the mirror and see a version of themselves in a position of power elsewhere. People in both countries have feared that the sort of validation Trump and Bolsonaro derive from each other could only lead to even more backlash against their most marginalized communities.\n\n\u201cWhen we see two far-right, neo-fascist people like Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro meeting, we know it can only signal something bad for the oppressed people of their respective nations,\u201d Sean Blackmon, a D.C.-based activist, said after a Sunday afternoon protest outside the White House, where nearly 100 people demonstrated against Bolsonaro\u2019s visit.\n\nTrump\u2019s aggressive macho politics have helped amplify fringe \u201cmen\u2019s rights movements\u201d and emboldened white nationalists in the U.S. and elsewhere, with deadly consequences. Brazil is already one of the deadliest countries in the world for LGBTQ people, black people, and women \u2015 in 2019 so far, four women a day have died due to femicide \u2015 and there are fears across those communities that Bolsonaro\u2019s brand of politics will only make it worse.\n\n\u201cThese are two people who are both racist, sexist, bigoted against the LGBTQ community, and who support police terror,\u201d Blackmon said. \u201cWe may even see an intensification of oppression. This kind of tacit seal of approval from the United States has a lot of meaning across the world. When we see Donald Trump basically giving his seal of approval to Bolsonaro, it\u2019s a signal to him that nothing is going to stop him.\u201d\n\nTrump and Bolsonaro\u2019s machismo has made them friends \u2015 at least in the context of their presidencies. But the consequences of their approach to politics and the friendship it has fostered will likely linger well after both leave office.",

    "description": "Venezuela\u2019s worst-ever power outage Friday raised tensions in a country already on edge from ongoing political turmoil.",
    "text": "March 8, 2019, 8:28 PM GMT By Associated Press\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 Hospitals struggled to get back-up generators running, businesses shuttered and families anxiously tried to contact loved ones amid Venezuela's worst-ever power outage Friday, raising tensions in a country already on edge from ongoing political turmoil.\n\nMuch of the nation of 31 million people was still without electricity as the blackout stretched into a second day and patience began to wear thin.\n\n\"This has never happened before,\" a frustrated Orlando Roa, 54, said, decrying President Nicolas Maduro's administration for failing to maintain the electrical system and letting qualified engineers leave the country. \"This is the fault of the government.\"\n\nThe blackout was reported to have hit 22 of 23 states, striking during the peak of evening rush hour Thursday, sending thousands of people on long nighttime treks home through some of the world's most violent streets. Maduro ordered schools and all government entities closed and told businesses not to open to facilitate work crews trying to restore power.\n\nBy early Friday afternoon, residents and pro-government state broadcaster VTV reported that power was starting to return to parts of Caracas. The stoplights in several neighborhoods were back on while in one office building the electricity flickered to life and then turned off.\n\nVenezuela's socialist government blamed the power failure on right-wing extremists taking orders from the United States, including Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, and said they were intent on causing pandemonium for several days but offered no proof.\n\nMothers and relatives wait outside of a clinic for babies during a power outage in Caracas on March 7, 2019. Ariana Cubillos / AP\n\n\"The electricity war declared and directed by the imperialist United States against our people will be overcome!\" President Nicolas Maduro wrote on Twitter in his few public remarks on the outage. \"No one can defeat the people of Bolivar and Chavez. Maximum unity patriots!\"\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo shot back saying only Maduro was to blame.\n\n\"Maduro's policies bring nothing but darkness,\" Pompeo wrote on social media. \"No food. No medicine. Now, no power. Next, no Maduro.\"\n\nThe outage comes as Venezuela is in the throes of a political struggle between Maduro and opposition leader Juan Guaido, the head of congress who declared himself the nation's rightful president in January and is recognized by the United States and about 50 other nations.\n\nWithout power to charge cell phones, normally hyper-active social media was eerily quiet. Those who managed to get a signal used the hashtag #SinLuz \u2014 meaning without light in English \u2014 to share images of cities throughout the country that on Friday resembled ghost towns.\n\nOne user posted a video of a nurse manually pumping air into the lungs of an infant. Others posted photos of long lines of cars queuing up at gas stations in hopes of getting fuel. A man anguished that he'd gone 17 hours without hearing from his mother.\n\n\"What impotence!\" he lamented.\n\nNetblocks, a non-government group based in Europe that monitors internet censorship, said online connectivity data indicates the outage is the largest in recent record in Latin America. The observatory warned Friday that some of the remaining networks were starting to fall offline as generators and backups began depleting and cell towers shut down.\n\nThe director of CODEVIDA, a coalition of Venezuelan health advocacy groups, reported that thousands of dialysis patients were going without treatment as a result of the blackout. While some hospitals were able to rely on back-up power sources, others were dark.\n\nAt the maternity ward at the Avila Clinic in wealthy eastern Caracas Thursday night, several mothers wept as nurses held candles to monitor the vital signs of premature babies in incubators.\n\nZaida Rodriguez, 40, a cardiovascular technician, walked several miles to the private clinic where she works only to be told by bosses that she should leave because the facility would treat only urgent cases and operate with a skeletan staff in order to save on power.\n\n\"How is it possible for an oil country like ours to be without an emergency backup in place for these types of situations?\" she asked. \"This is pathetic.\"\n\nVenezuela's electrical system was once the envy of Latin America but it has fallen into disrepair after years of poor maintenance and mismanagement. High-ranking officials have been accused in U.S. court proceedings of looting government money earmarked for the electrical system.\n\nWhile intermittent outages have become regular occurrences in Venezuela of late, rarely have so many states simultaneously been without power for such an extended period. Until now, Caracas had largely been spared the worst of a collapse in the nation's grid.\n\nThe government keeps home power bills exceptionally low \u2014 just a couple dollars a month \u2014 relying heavily on subsidies from the Maduro administration, which is under increasing financial duress.\n\nThe nation is experiencing hyperinflation projected to reach a mind-boggling 10 million percent this year, is grappling with food and medical shortages, and has lost about 10 percent of its population to migration in the past few years \u2014 including many with valuable energy expertise. Venezuela's economic woes are likely to increase as U.S. sanctions against its oil industry kick in.\n\nState-owned electricity operator Corpoelec blamed the outage on an act of \"sabotage\" at the Guri Dam, one of the world's largest hydroelectric stations and the cornerstone of Venezuela's electrical grid. Information Minister Jorge Rodriguez described it as a \"cyber\" attack intended to derail the whole system. He said electricity in Venezuela's eastern region had been restored within hours.\n\n\"What's the intention?\" he said. \"To submit the Venezuelan people to various days without electricity to attack, to mistreat, so that vital areas would be without power.\"\n\nPro-government officials often blame outages on Venezuela's opposition, accusing them of attacking power substations with Molotov cocktails, though they rarely provide any evidence.\n\nGuaido did a survey of Caracas Friday to evaluate the impact of the blackout, blaming Maduro for the sorry state of affairs and looking to capitalize on what some decried as a sign of Venezuela's newfound status as a \"failed state\" even though it sits atop the world's largest oil reserves.\n\nPeople wait for public transportation amid the country's worst-ever power outage in Caracas on March 8, 2019. Eduardo Verdugo / AP\n\n\"It's clear who is responsible for this disaster,\" he said, renewing his call for Venezuelans to take to the streets Saturday in protest. \"They keep making excuses, they keep looking for scapegoats, when corruption, calamity are what have caused this situation.\"\n\nRubio, who has been driving the Trump administration's confrontational stance toward Maduro, seemed to relish Rodriguez's accusations that he was somehow to blame for the power crisis.\n\n\"My apologies to people of Venezuela,\" the Florida Republican said in a message on Twitter. \"I must have pressed the wrong thing on the 'electronic attack' app I downloaded from Apple. My bad.\"\n\nThe blackout snarled traffic amid confusion generated by blackened stoplights; the subway in Caracas broke down; and there were reports that a flight Thursday from neighboring Colombia was turned back because the Caracas airport's backup generators failed, leaving customs officials without the ability to screen those arriving.\n\nA video posted online of the Caracas airport showed angry passengers waiting in front of check-in counters in the dark Thursday demanding to be let on planes.\n\n\"Flight! Flight! Flight!\" they cried out.\n\nAs the blackout wore on, Venezuelans already struggling to put food on the table worried the little they have would get spoiled in fridges without power. Business owners griped over losses that were certain to compound their already bleak economic outlook.\n\n\"The only thing left for me to do is wait for the light to return,\" said Jose Rodriguez, 51, the owner of a small restaurant in Caracas. \"Today will be a lost day for me.\"\n\nFOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM.",

    "text": "Lally Weymouth is a senior associate editor for The Washington Post.\n\nJuan Guaid\u00f3, Venezuela\u2019s compelling and popular interim president is the first real threat to the authoritarian regime of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who has refused to yield power after what the legislature called an invalid election. In search of momentum for the opposition, Guaid\u00f3 left his country two weeks ago to take meetings with foreign leaders (including with Vice President Pence) in Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Ecuador. Venezuelan exiles in those nations poured into the streets to greet him. But if he was expecting the military to abandon the regime and support his claim to the presidency, it didn\u2019t work. What will happen when Guaid\u00f3, 35, returns to Venezuela? Maduro\u2019s regime may arrest him, or perhaps he\u2019ll galvanize Maduro\u2019s backers and win their loyalty. More likely, the standoff will continue. Guaid\u00f3 talked with The Washington Post\u2019s Lally Weymouth as he prepares to reenter his country. Edited excerpts follow.\n\nQ: Why did you leave Venezuela?\n\nA: I [initially] left to attend the humanitarian assistance gathering where Colombia\u2019s President Iv\u00e1n Duque as well as Paraguay\u2019s President Mario Abdo Ben\u00edtez were present.\n\nQ: To leave was a big risk. Did you make the right call?\n\nA: My international visit has been very important to consolidate support from regional leaders \u2014 not just for humanitarian assistance but to continue to pressure Maduro.\n\nQ: Do you see any way to get rid of Maduro?\n\nA: I see many ways of getting rid of Maduro. He\u2019s completely isolated, so much so that his only recourse is to continue to repress and use force against the people of Venezuela. The use of force is by paramilitary groups, it isn\u2019t even the National Guard.\n\nQ: Is the army split? There were 200 defections from the military, but many officers have not defected.\n\nA: Two hundred is only a small portion. The vast majority of the armed forces, 80 percent, support me and reject the regime. It\u2019s just the top people who continue to hold on. There is a lot of fear, because of the types of tactics that they\u2019re using.\n\nQ: Is it possible to get rid of Maduro without the use of force?\n\nA: In Venezuela, we have tried everything. We have protested, we have continued to push in every direction for a peaceful transition. Right now, I see three scenarios. First, that an election is allowed to take place in a free and transparent manner. That\u2019s what we\u2019re working for as soon as possible. Second is some sort of sui generis transition with Chavismo [parts of the regime]. That\u2019s something that\u2019s difficult to imagine at this point.\n\nQ: A transition that includes the military or parts of the regime?\n\nA: I\u2019m referring to something like what happened on January 23 of 1958 \u2014 the date when parts of the military removed the dictator [Marcos P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez]. Lastly, there is an option where the military could get on the side of the constitution and of Guaid\u00f3 and of the resistance, and it could stop the usurpation. That\u2019s the option that uses force, but it comes from within.\n\nQ: So a military coup, so to speak?\n\nA: Yes, but the military gets on the side of the constitution \u2014 so it\u2019s not a military coup. It\u2019s ceasing the usurpation. It is Maduro right now who is the biggest impediment for a peaceful solution to take place.\n\nQ: Is it true that the Cuban agents torture the armed forces if they try to even contact the opposition?\n\nA: Yes, it\u2019s definitely true. Torture is one of the things that is being used to dissuade any sort of dissent in the armed forces, and the Cubans are definitely part of it \u2014 the G2 Cubans, their intelligence service.\n\nQ: Do you have people who you talk to in the military?\n\nA: There are communications channels, but obviously it is a difficult situation, because of the dictatorship and the repression that takes place within the armed forces. It has taken time to build trust among parties.\n\nQ: Will you offer Maduro and his top generals amnesty to dislodge them from power? Will you guarantee them safe passage and access to their money?\n\nA: We have offered amnesty and guarantees to both military and civilians who are part of the regime but who are willing to help restore democracy in Venezuela.\n\nQ: Not a general amnesty?\n\nA: No. Only to those who take those steps.\n\nQ: Can you get rid of Maduro without promising him safe passage and a new home elsewhere?\n\nA: Offering amnesty to Maduro is an option. Bear in mind that the only crimes to which amnesty cannot be applied are crimes against humanity.\n\nQ: You started off as a student leader, and then you ran for congress in 2015. You took over the Popular Will party when its leader was put under house arrest in 2019. As leader of the National Assembly, the only democratically elected institution in the country, you declared yourself interim president in January after the Lima Group, a group of nations from the region, said they would not recognize Maduro's election. Now you're world-famous and recognized by 50 governments. How would you explain who you are to the American people?\n\nA: I am a young man from humble origins who has had the opportunity to serve my country, to resist this dictatorship, along with [other opposition leaders] . . . . Venezuela has immense talents and resources, and we can help rebuild our democracy.\n\nQ: Are you happy with what the Trump administration has done to help the Venezuelan opposition? Would you like President Trump to do more?\n\nA: President Trump\u2019s leadership has been very important to this effort of restoring democracy to Venezuela.\n\nQ: Are the U.S. sanctions enough, or do you need more, like military intervention?\n\nA: The sanctions have been a key element in making sure that those who have violated human rights and are guilty of corruption have a clear consequence to their actions. They have also been key to helping protect the assets of the Venezuelan people.\n\nQ: Not having them stolen, you mean?\n\nA: Yes, and to try to dissuade these people from continuing to steal. In terms of next steps, Vice President Pence has said and I have said that all options are on the table when it comes to restoring democracy in Venezuela.\n\nQ: Do you think some kind of force needs to be used in this situation?\n\nA: We all want a peaceful solution to this situation, but this is a criminal regime that will only cede power under immense pressure. Venezuela is in a very precarious situation with the hyperinflation and the suffering of the Venezuelan people, so change is urgent. There is no food; there is a humanitarian crisis and great suffering by the Venezuelan people.\n\nQ: Are you going to visit Europe \u2014 France or Germany \u2014 before you go home to Venezuela? Will you visit the United States?\n\nA: I do have plans to go to Europe and other countries in Latin America, but I am first going back to Venezuela.\n\nQ: Are you worried you'll be detained or arrested?\n\nA: There are definitely a lot of risks to going back. The exercise of politics is criminalized in Venezuela. But I\u2019m willing to go back and take that risk. . . . If [I were arrested], it would be the usurper\u2019s [Maduro\u2019s] last mistake. This would be a coup d\u2019etat. And it would be harshly and strongly rejected by both the Venezuelan people and the international community.\n\nQ: Do you believe you are losing popularity by being out of the country? You are so popular inside Venezuela.\n\nA: No, not at all. We have been strengthened, both internally and externally, because of this tour. That\u2019s why I\u2019m prepared to go back home.\n\nQ: I saw the pictures of the masses of Venezuelans migrants who came out to meet you in every Latin American country you visited. Did you ever expect to see such a welcome?\n\nA: That\u2019s really happening because of the massive crisis that\u2019s happening in Venezuela. I have taken on this responsibility and it has awakened a lot of hope for change in the Venezuelan population, both inside the country and out.\n\nQ: How will you organize a free and fair election if you do come to power, especially considering the three million Venezuelans who have had to leave the country? The Maduro and Hugo Ch\u00e1vez regimes changed the electoral system, so it's not going to be so easy.\n\nA: One of the first points is to completely reform the National Electoral Council. Furthermore, I\u2019m going to make sure that all constitutional rights are guaranteed to elect and be elected. That is to say, all the Venezuelans who are abroad should be properly registered, and all the people within the country should be also be properly registered. It\u2019s important to make sure that no candidates are barred from running. Moreover, it\u2019s very important to have the international community present observing the election to make sure its completely transparent.\n\nQ: You won't be able to do that overnight, right?\n\nA: No, it will definitely take time. Our best experts have looked at this and determined that once [Maduro is gone from power], it could take from six to nine months.\n\nQ: The economy of Venezuela is in a free fall. Are you concerned about the impact of new U.S. sanctions on the population? Do you have a vision as to what you would do as president to rebuild your country? Do you think that Venezuela would need a Marshall Plan?\n\nA: The economy was in a free fall before the sanctions. There has been a 53 percent GDP drop and a 1 million percent inflation rate. There was already a very bad situation before the sanctions. What we are worried about, what we are trying to move forward on, is using our natural resources, using the trust we have built with the international community to have access to refinancing.\n\nTwitter: @LallyWeymouth\n\nRead more perspectives at washingtonpost.com/outlook\n\nRead more from Outlook:\n\nFollow our updates on Facebook and Twitter.",

    "title": "'The party of healthcare': How Donald Trump is reshaping his strategy post-Mueller",
    "description": "Donald Trump used a Grand Rapids rally to debut a post-Mueller strategy that includes reviving battles on healthcare, immigration and other issues.",
    "text": "CLOSE President Trump wants to release classified documents from the Russia probe. He and former FBI director James Comey weighed in on the Mueller report. USA Today\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Energized by special counsel Robert Mueller's finding of \"no collusion\" with Russia, President Donald Trump is relitigating a host of contentious policy battles \u2013 from health care to immigration \u2013 that could dramatically shape his reelection effort.\n\nTrump faces a political dynamic on Capitol Hill that has not changed. Democrats, who control the House and have the power to block his initiatives, remain hostile to his agenda. But the president has ramped up his rhetoric on immigration, reopened fights over health care and storm-ravaged Puerto Rico and vowed to \"fix\" the crisis in Venezuela.\n\n\"Now that the Mueller report is behind them, the White House feels liberated to start putting its energy into pursuing its legislative agenda,\" said GOP strategist Ron Bonjean. \"It's likely going to force the House Democratic leadership to stand in the way of its progress, allowing Trump to use his megaphone against them.\"\n\nEyeing the growing field of Democratic candidates seeking to unseat him in 2020, Trump returned to battleground Michigan for a rally Thursday in which he reveled in the findings from the Mueller report summary and repeatedly slammed his critics.\n\n\"The collusion delusion is over,\" Trump told supporters at the Grand Rapids rally, where he debuted his renewed intention to fight on several policy fronts.\n\nHere's a look at the president's post-Mueller approach:\n\n'Party of Health care!'\n\nTrump shocked Republicans and Democrats this week by reopening a fight over Obamacare that many believed he already fought and lost.\n\nA decade after the Affordable Care Act became law, Trump's administration told a federal court it would support tossing the law, reversing an earlier strategy. The president promised the GOP would become the \"party of health care,\" but the administration has not proposed a plan in two years to save the popular aspects of the plan, like guaranteed coverage for people with preexisting conditions.\n\nObamacare repeal: Senate narrowly defeats 'skinny repeal' of Obamacare, as McCain votes 'no'\n\nMcCain: Senate members gasp, applaud as McCain votes no on 'skinny repeal'\n\nRepublicans revoked a central Obamacare provision that required Americans to purchase health insurance or face a tax penalty, but the party has failed to repeal the law in its entirety. And some Republicans have expressed anxiety about reopening the issue.\n\n\"We're working on a plan now,\" Trump, apparently undaunted by those concerns, told reporters on Thursday. \"We will have a plan that's far better than Obamacare.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump (Photo: Jacquelyn Martin/AP)\n\nImmigration redux\n\nTrump is stepping up his battle on an issue that both parties in Congress have sought to avoid: Immigration. Trump has touted early work on his proposed wall along the U.S-Mexico border and has threatened to close the southern border entirely.\n\nIn recent days, the president again has raised the prospect of closing the U.S.-Mexico border, a threat he has made previously without executing. At his rally Thursday night and in a series of tweets Friday, Trump claimed Mexico is not doing enough to stop Central American migrants from crossing the border.\n\nThe logistical challenges and potential impact of closing the U.S.-Mexico border would be enormous, experts have said.\n\nBorder: Trump threatens to close border if Mexico doesn't 'immediately stop' immigrants\n\nMeanwhile, some aides are still in the hunt for a broader solution on immigration.\n\nJared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and top adviser, has been meeting with experts and stakeholders to discuss potential reforms to legal immigration, said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports tougher immigration laws. Kushner had tried to strike that broader deal late last year as part of the failed negotiations that led to a 35-day government shutdown.\n\nAs with health care, it's not clear there's much appetite in Congress to address immigration, particularly as the presidential election heats up.\n\n\"The Dems refuse to do what they know is necessary \u2013 amend our immigration laws,\" Trump wrote on Twitter on Thursday. \"Would immediately solve the problem!\"\n\nWe have a National Emergency at our Southern Border. The Dems refuse to do what they know is necessary - amend our immigration laws. Would immediately solve the problem! Mexico, with the strongest immigration laws in the World, refuses to help with illegal immigration & drugs! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 28, 2019\n\nTrade talks\n\nTrump met with Republican lawmakers at the White House on Tuesday as the administration prepares to shepherd its NAFTA replacement through Congress. The new U.S.-Canada-Mexico trade deal, which the president has dubbed USMCA, needs only a simple majority to clear both chambers, but the measure faces dicey prospects in the Democrat-controlled House.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House sent high-level officials to Beijing this week to try to negotiate a way out of the impasse with China over trade. While both sides have stepped back from the tit-for-tat trade war that roiled markets last year, many existing barriers continue to affect manufacturing and agricultural industries.\n\nNew green punching bag\n\nThe Green New Deal, Democrats' aspirational proposal to confront climate change, has become a rallying cry for Trump, who has used it as an example of how Democratic candidates are veering to the left in Trump's Washington.\n\nThe proposal calls for combating climate change by eliminating carbon emissions and shifting the economy to one powered by renewable fuels. Trump sees the policy prescriptions in the plan, blocked by a procedural vote in the Senate on Tuesday,\n\nas a winning touchstone among his core voters.\n\nTrump has not proposed a plan to address climate change, which he described as a \"hoax\" during the 2016 campaign.\n\n\"What about brilliant policies like the Green New Deal?\" the president's son Donald Trump Jr. asked supporters during the Michigan rally. \"What's scarier about the Green New Deal is that every mainstream Democrat leading presidential contender is like 'this is a great idea!'\"\n\nCLOSE Utah Republican Senator Mike Lee used posters showing Aquaman and Star Wars characters to paint the Green New Deal bill as \"ridiculous.\" USA TODAY\n\nPuerto Rico aid\n\nTrump defended his record on Puerto Rico Thursday amid reports he is reopening a debate over the amount of federal aid allocated to the island after Hurricane Maria, which made landfall in 2017.\n\nDuring a meeting with Senate Republicans, Trump questioned why Puerto Rico was receiving billions of dollars in aid, according to reports. Trump has had a longstanding feud with Puerto Rican officials, including San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, though the issue had subsided somewhat before moving to the fore again this week.\n\nThe coverage of Trump's remarks prompted Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 to issue a stern warning to Trump on Thursday. \"If the bully gets close, I'll punch the bully in the mouth,\" Rossell\u00f3 told CNN in an interview. \"It would be a mistake to confuse courtesy with courage.\"\n\nTrump fired back in remarks at the White House.\n\n\"Puerto Rico has been taken care of better by Donald Trump than by any living human being and I think the people of Puerto Rico understand it,\" Trump said. \"They don't know how to spend the money and they're not spending it wisely.\"\n\nContributing: Christal Hayes\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/03/29/donald-trump-post-mueller-strategy-healthcare/3301427002/",

    "title": "Marco Rubio Mistakes Venezuelan Journalist Named Germ\u00e1n Dam for an Actual Dam",
    "description": "In a tweet over the weekend, the Florida senator mistook a journalist covering the crisis in Venezuela, Germ\u00e1n Dam, for a hydroelectric barrier.",
    "text": "Photo: Luis Robayo/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOn Twitter, Florida Senator Marco Rubio \u2013 who has been called the architect of the American plan to intervene in Venezuela \u2013 has been very concerned about the political and humanitarian crisis, tweeting about the state of the country some 16 times over the weekend. The number would be higher, but Rubio deleted a post from Sunday in which he claimed that a transformer at the \u201cGerman Dam in Bolivar State\u201d exploded, causing blackouts that reportedly killed critically ill patients.\n\nOne journalist covering the power struggle in Venezuela responded with an embarrassing correction, explaining that a transformer did explode in Boliv\u00e1r, but that \u201cit was not in a dam, much less german. My name is Germ\u00e1n Dam, I am one of the journalists who published the information.\u201d\n\nElectricity outages are fairly common is Venezuela \u2013 critics cite years of official corruption and intermittent infrastructure updates for the problem. Last week, however, President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro claimed that outages were caused by \u201cthe electric war announced and directed by American imperialism against our people.\u201d In January, the Trump administration officially backed opposition figure Juan Guaid\u00f3 as the country\u2019s legitimate leader, and last month, Trump said that \u201call options are open\u201d regarding U.S. intervention.\n\nRubio, the senator for the state where almost half of the U.S.-Venezuelan population lives, has taken a hawkish, interventionist stance in the leadership crisis in Venezuela, and was even drawn into the controversy over the power outages: Venezuelan Information Minister Jorge Rodriguez claimed that Rubio was involved in a cyberattack on the operating system of a different hydroelectric dam that blew up over the weekend. Rubio, not above an online beef, called Rodriguez the \u201cBaghdad Bob\u201d of Caracas.",

    "title": "U.S. pulling last of its embassy personnel from Venezuela",
    "description": "Move comes as blackout continues and desperation spreads across much of nation in grips of political crisis and hyperinflation",
    "text": "Caracas, Venezuela -- The United States announced late Monday that it's pulling the remaining staff from its embassy in Venezuela, citing the deteriorating situation in the South American nation.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the decision as Venezuela struggled to restore electricity following four days of blackouts around the country in the midst of a deepening political crisis.\n\nVenezuela's congress declared a \"state of alarm\" Monday due to the blackout, the Reuters news agency reports. Venezuela also suspended school and business activities, officials said, the third time that's happened since the power grid went down last week.\n\nThe U.S. has led an international effort to oust socialist President Nicolas Maduro and replace him with opposition leader Juan Guaido, who vows to hold a new presidential election. Guaido is backed by some 50 countries, while Maduro maintains support from countries such as China, Russia and Cuba.\n\nMaduro had ordered all U.S. diplomats to leave Venezuela in late January because of its support of Guaido, but he retreated and allowed them to stay. The U.S. still withdrew dependents of embassy personnel as well as some of the staff. Pompeo said the remaining diplomats would be out of Venezuela by the end of the week.\n\nVenezuela deports American journalist Cody Weddle back to U.S.\n\nThe move came after another day of chaos as power outages that began Thursday evening continued to cause problems for Venezuelans, leaving them with little power, water and communications.\n\nPeople converged on a polluted river to fill water bottles in Caracas and scattered protests erupted in several cities\n\nA 3-year-old girl with a brain tumor languished in a Caracas hospital awaiting treatment after doctors started surgery but then suspended the operation when nationwide power outages first hit on Thursday, said the girl's fearful mother, who only gave her first name, Yalimar.\n\n\"The doctors told me that there are no miracles,\" said Yalimar, who hopes her daughter can be transferred Tuesday to one of the few hospitals in Venezuela that would be able to finish the complex procedure.\n\nThe girl's story highlighted an unfolding horror in Venezuela, where years of hardship got abruptly worse after the power grid collapsed.\n\nOn Monday, long lines of cars waited at the few gasoline stations with electricity and hospitals cared for many patients without power. Generators have alleviated conditions for some of the critically ill.\n\nMaduro said on national television Monday night that progress had been made in restoring electricity in Venezuela. He also said two people who were allegedly trying to sabotage power facilities were captured and were providing information to authorities, though he gave no details.\n\nVenezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 plans to take over as president when he returns\n\nGuaido, who heads the opposition-controlled congress, and the United States say Maduro's claims that the U.S. sabotaged the power grid with a \"cyberattack\" are an attempt to divert attention from the government's own failings.\n\nThere have been acts of kindness during Venezuela's crisis: People whose food would rot in refrigerators without power donated it to a restaurant, which cooked it for distribution to charities and hospitals.\n\nThe blackouts also have hit the oil industry. The country hasn't shipped $358 million in oil since the power failures started, and \"the whole system is grinding to a halt,\" said Russ Dallen, a Miami-based partner at the brokerage firm Caracas Capital Markets.\n\nTwo large tankers sat empty at the Jose offshore oil-loading dock, and at least 19 other ships were waiting their turns there, Dallen said.\n\nEngineers have restored power in some parts of Venezuela, but it often goes out again. There have been a few protests in Caracas and reports of similar anti-government anger elsewhere. Guaido tweeted about reports of looting in some cities, but details were difficult to confirm.\n\nSecurity forces in the city of Maracaibo dispersed \"criminals\" trying to take advantage of the power cuts, Mayor Willy Casanova told local media. However, numerous videos posted on social media that purported to be from Maracaibo showed crowds roaming the streets and people running from looted, damaged buildings with no police in sight.\n\nIn Caracas, some people reported more sightings of \"colectivos,\" a term for armed groups allegedly operating on behalf of the state to intimidate opponents.\n\nThe mood in Caracas was desperate.\n\nMarian Morales, a nurse working for a Catholic youth group, and several colleagues handed out diapers and food from a car parked near a hospital. Police and men in civilian clothing ordered them to leave, saying they didn't have permission to be there.\n\nMorales said the needy are cautious about approaching to collect the handouts because of the presence of security forces.\n\nEarly Monday, an explosion rocked a power station in the Baruta area of Caracas. Residents gathered to look at the charred, smoldering equipment.\n\nGuaido said three of four electricity transformers servicing the area were knocked out. He has blamed the blackouts on government corruption and mismanagement.\n\nWinston Cabas, the head of Venezuela's electrical engineers union, which opposes the government, disputed government allegations that the country's main hydroelectric dam was sabotaged last week. He blamed a lack of maintenance as well as the departure of skilled workers from the troubled country over the years.\n\n\"The system is vulnerable, fragile and unstable,\" he said.\n\nSpain's airline pilots union asked for Spanish airline Air Europa to stop flying to Venezuela after one of its crews was attacked at gunpoint in Caracas. The Sepla union said two pilots and eight more crew members of a flight from Madrid were assaulted on Saturday while going from the airport to their hotel in the Venezuelan capital. None of the crew members was injured.\n\nAir Europa responded by ordering the crews of flights to Venezuela to not spend the night in the country, according to the union.\n\nThe Trump administration imposed sanctions on a Moscow-based bank jointly owned by Russian and Venezuelan state-owned companies, alleging it tried to circumvent U.S. sanctions on the South American country. The U.S. said it is targeting Evrofinance Mosnarbank for supporting Petroleos de Venezuela SA, the state oil company previously targeted by sanctions in January.\n\nEvrofinance said it was carrying out its activities normally despite the announcement and pledged to \"meet its obligations to the clients and partners in full.\"\n\nThe U.S. and the other governments that recognize Guaido as Venezuela's interim president say Maduro wasn't legitimately re-elected last year because opposition candidates weren't permitted to run. Maduro says he is the target of a U.S. coup plot.",

    "text": "The White House will soon impose major new sanctions against the Cuban government over its support for the regime of contested Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a source familiar with President Trump's national security team told Fox News.\n\nThe White House announced sweeping sanctions against Maduro's government in January, and in a fiery anti-socialism address last month, Trump linked Cuba and Venezuela's fortunes: \"The days of socialism and communism are numbered not only in Venezuela, but in Nicaragua and Cuba as well,\" Trump said, as the crowd roared. \"Do we love Cuba? Do we love Nicaragua? Great countries. Great potential.\"\n\nOPINION: CUBA WILL BREAK YOUR HEART\n\nThe move against Cuba -- which Trump has accused of propping up Maduro as a puppet -- would be an application of the Helms-Burton Act, Fox News is told. That 1996 law includes a provision that, if activated, would permit Cuban Americans who are U.S. citizens to file lawsuits against both foreign corporations and individuals concerning property seized by the Cuban government, including during the 1959 Cuban Revolution led by Fidel Castro.\n\nThe Title III provisions of Helms-Burton have been waived by every administration, but the Trump administration in January opted only to suspend its terms for 45 days, rather than the normal six-month period that previous administrations have repeatedly invoked.\n\nCUBAN GUARDS SURROUNDING MADURO, US MILITARY COMMANDER SAYS\n\n\u201cThis extension will permit us to conduct a careful review of the right to bring action under Title III in light of the national interests of the United States and efforts to expedite a transition to democracy in Cuba,\" the State Department said. \"We encourage any person doing business in Cuba to reconsider whether they are trafficking in confiscated property and abetting this dictatorship.\u201d\n\nIn response, Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez characterized the Trump administration's move on Twitter as \"political blackmail\u201d and a \u201cbrutal attack against international law.\u201d\n\nIn February, Navy Adm. Craig S. Faller, commander of U.S. Southern Command, testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday that Maduro, fearing for his own safety, has \u201ccompletely surround[ed]\u201d himself with Cuban security.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a good sense of where the loyalty of the Venezuelan people are, that his immediate security force is made up of Cubans,\u201d Faller told the committee.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton, R- Ark., apparently surprised by the testimony, asked how many of these Secret Service-style guards Maduro has in the country.\n\nThe answer: \u201cI don\u2019t have that number\u201d but \u201cI\u2019d say there are many.\u201d\n\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFaller added that Russia and China have been involved in what intelligence officials say are measures to support Maduro\u2019s regime. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen reporting of Russian security forces being flown in,\u201d he said. \u201cChina\u2019s not been helpful in a diplomatic way. I\u2019ll leave that to the diplomats, but China\u2019s in there and they\u2019re involved in cyber ways that are not helpful to a democratic outcome.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, nearly 87 percent of Cuban voters approved a new constitution that preserves the island's single-party Socialist system and centrally planned economy while updating some financial, electoral and criminal laws, authorities there said in late February. The margin of victory was relatively low for a country where opposition parties and campaigns are illegal and official proposals routinely receive higher than 90 percent approval.\n\nThe U.S., which has recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as interim president of Venezuela, has sent aid to Venezuela despite Maduro\u2019s refusal to accept it. Late last month, Maduro-backed troops blocked the aid convoys at the border and fired tear gas on protesters in clashes that left two people dead and some 300 injured, as Maduro insisted the aid was a ploy by the U.S. to undermine his leadership.\n\n\"How many of you national guardsmen have a sick mother? How many have kids in school without food,\" Guaido said, standing alongside a warehouse in the Colombian city of Cucuta where 600 tons of mostly U.S.-supplied boxes of food and medicine have been stockpiled. \"You don't owe any obedience to a sadist...who celebrates the denial of humanitarian aid the country needs.\"\n\nThe Trump administration imposed sanctions Friday on six high-ranking members of the Venezuelan security forces and revoked the visas of other officials and their relatives over the aid blockade.\n\nThe measures were the latest by the Trump administration to increase the international pressure on Maduro, whose re-election last year is seen as illegitimate, to resign and turn power over to Guaido, who has been recognized by the U.S. and 50 other government as interim president.\n\nThe State Department later said that the U.S. had revoked the visas of 49 people, making them subject to deportation if they are in the country. It placed an unspecified number of others on a visa restriction list.\n\nFox News' Paulina Dedaj and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins/File Photo\n\nThe report\u2019s findings contrast with comments from President Nicolas Maduro, who has said there is no crisis and no need for humanitarian aid, blaming U.S. sanctions for the country\u2019s economic problems.\n\nThe United Nations has found itself stuck in the middle of the political struggle that pits Maduro against U.S.-backed opposition leader Juan Guaido, who invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency in January, arguing that Maduro\u2019s 2018 re-election was illegitimate.\n\nLast month, Venezuelan government troops blocked U.S.-backed aid convoys entering from Colombia and Brazil.\n\nHowever, Maduro\u2019s government has accepted aid from ally Russia.\n\n\u201cThe politicization of humanitarian assistance in the context of the crisis makes delivery of assistance in accordance with the principles of neutrality, impartiality and independence more difficult,\u201d reads the 45-page U.N. \u201cOverview of Priority Humanitarian Needs\u201d in Venezuela.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s information ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe March 2019 U.N. review uses a \u201cbroad range\u201d of sources - including U.N. agencies, the Red Cross, academia and civil society - and is part of a push by the world body to try and scale up its humanitarian response in Venezuela.\n\n\u201cMuch more action is required to meet the growing needs of the Venezuelan people,\u201d reads the report, which warned that a lack of reliable, official data made it difficult to accurately determine the scope of need.\n\nIt estimates 94 percent of the 28.8 million people live in poverty, while some 3.4 million people have fled, with a further 1.9 million expected to follow in this year.\n\n\u201cDue to an increasingly contracted economy and political unrest, the Venezuelan population is facing unprecedented challenges in accessing essential services, including protection, healthcare, medicines, vaccinations, water, electricity, education and access to food,\u201d the report said.\n\nThere are an estimated 2.8 million people in need when it comes to healthcare, according to the U.N. review, including some 300,000 people whose lives are at risk because they have been unable to access medicines or treatment for diseases like cancer, diabetes and HIV for more than a year.\n\n\u201cPreventable diseases such as tuberculosis, diphtheria, measles and malaria have resurfaced in the country and are on the rise, as is hepatitis A, due to the lack of access to safe drinking water,\u201d the report said.\n\nIn the area of water, sanitation and hygiene, 4.3 million people are in need of help, according to the report.\n\nIt said a shortage of food had left some 1.9 million people in nutrition need, while an increase in violence in the country meant some 2.7 million Venezuelans were vulnerable.\n\nSome 1.2 million children are not in school due to the crisis, the report said, because many families cannot afford the clothing, footwear or transportation required and children are instead working to help pay for their family\u2019s essential needs. Another 1 million were found to be highly vulnerable to dropping out of school.",

    "description": "How Russia sank billions of dollars into Venezuelan quicksand Reuters Russian oil company Rosneft spent a fortune on joint ventures in Venezuela even though it suspected it was losing out on millions of dollars, documents show.",
    "text": "Missing parts and missed deadlines\n\nIn September 2012, at a drilling site in the Orinoco basin, Rosneft\u2019s Sechin filled a jar with crude oil and lifted it into the air to mark the moment his firm joined the ranks of global oil majors. Rosneft was part of a Russian consortium that had acquired a 40 percent share in Venezuela\u2019s Junin-6 oilfield. PDVSA held the other 60 percent.\n\nRosneft already pumped oil from its home fields in Siberia; now it had an overseas presence too, tapping into some of the world's biggest crude oil reserves on the banks of the Orinoco River. \u201cToday is indeed an historic day,\u201d Sechin told Russian state television at the ceremony to mark the start of production. \u201cRussian companies have now proved their right to be among the leaders of the global oil sector.\u201d\n\nYet soon after Sechin spoke, Rosneft's foray into the Orinoco basin was running into problems, the documents reviewed by Reuters show.\n\nIn November 2012, without asking its Russian partners, PDVSA shut down one of the four drilling rigs at Junin-6 and removed it, a report by the Russian consortium found that year. Local people staged protests that further blocked work. By the end of 2012, just six wells had been drilled, far short of the project\u2019s target of 47.\n\n\u201cAs of 15.08.2015, PDVSA is in technical default.\u201d\n\nSpare parts for drilling at Junin-6 were procured from a PDVSA unit called Bariven; but getting equipment from Bariven took 10 to 18 months, according to the documents. Drilling rigs were not operating 37 percent of the time. It took on average 49 days to drill a single well, instead of the anticipated 22 days. PDVSA did not respond to questions about the delays.\n\nJunin-6 production forecasts were cut. Rosneft had said in September 2012 that the field would deliver 20,000 barrels per day by the end of the year. In fact, over the whole of 2012 it yielded only 21,400 barrels.\n\nThree years on, there was little sign of improvement. A Rosneft report covering the first three quarters of 2015 cited well construction \u201cof an unsatisfactory quality\u201d and \u201cnon-optimal trajectories\u201d of wells.\n\nBy the end of 2015, the forecast for peak oil output from Junin-6 had been slashed from 450,000 barrels per day to 250,000 barrels per day. Rosneft\u2019s flagship project had lost its lustre.\n\nProblems remain across the Orinoco Basin, according to union leaders who spoke to Reuters. They said that in fields east of Junin, only a handful of the dozens of drilling rigs are working at any one time. Workers complain they don\u2019t have basic equipment such as boots, gloves and helmets. The situation in PDVSA offices is no better. Paper is in short supply. In a vain effort to stem a worker exodus, some HR departments display \u201cNo resignation\u201d signs.\n\nNor is life in Venezuela easy for Rosneft staff. There is often no mains water in the high-end Caracas district where they live, said a Russian who knows families there. A couple of times a week, a water tanker arrives and fills up containers in each apartment.\n\nTwo of Rosneft's Russian partners in Junin-6 dropped out. The smaller Surgutneftegaz decided to quit the project in November 2012. In December 2014, Russia\u2019s second biggest oil firm, Lukoil, announced it too was dropping out. \u201cLooking back, a lot of people at Lukoil breathed a sigh of relief that they didn't have to pile billions into Venezuela,\u201d said an executive in the Junin-6 consortium.\n\nSurgutneftegaz did not respond to a request for comment. Lukoil declined to comment.\n\nRosneft bought out the Surgutneftegaz and Lukoil stakes for upward of $300 million, analysts estimated, deepening its exposure to Venezuela. It also acquired a stake belonging to TNK-BP when it purchased the Russian-British firm in a $55 billion deal in 2013. That left Gazpromneft, the oil unit of state-owned gas firm Gazprom, as Rosneft\u2019s sole remaining Russian partner in Junin-6. Gazpromneft did not reply to Reuters\u2019 questions.\n\nRosneft also had four smaller oil projects with PDVSA at that time. All were experiencing problems during this period, the Rosneft internal reports show. Two of the projects, Carabobo and Petromonagas, are in the Orinoco basin; Boqueron is in the east near the Atlantic coast; Petroperija is on the Caribbean coast.\n\nRosneft internal reports from 2015 concluded that crude flow rates envisaged in the contract for the Carabobo fields were \u201cnot achievable.\u201d At Petromonagas, poor quality work caused drilling delays. At Petroperija, production was falling and the joint venture did not have the cash to buy essential pumping equipment. At the Boqueron field, a broken compressor, a device to raise gas pressure, could not be fixed because the joint venture\u2019s bank account was empty.\n\nMoney troubles\n\nIf getting oil out of its projects was a struggle for Rosneft, so was extracting revenue, the documents show.\n\nThe Russian consortium\u2019s report into operations at Junin-6 in 2012 found that PDVSA had taken $12 million from the Junin-6 budget, without Rosneft\u2019s agreement, for social spending on local people. Only 350 people lived in the area covered by the concession - some 447 square kilometers of hilly scrubland on the northern bank of the Orinoco River.\n\nIn the second half of 2014, Rosneft ordered an audit of the Junin-6 project to check for \u201cdistortion of financial accounting\u201d and \u201cunjustified expenditures.\u201d Reuters couldn\u2019t determine that audit\u2019s conclusions.\n\nRosneft managers ordered the company\u2019s own auditors to investigate money flows between PDVSA and the Petromonagas, Petroperija and Boqueron joint ventures, internal documents relating to the audit show. The audit concluded that PDVSA had understated earnings from Petromonagas oil sales by some $700 million. PDVSA challenged this figure, another document shows, and it was revised to $500 million.\n\nIn a document dated April 30, 2015, Sechin, Rosneft\u2019s chief executive, approved the findings of the audit, and a plan to protect Rosneft\u2019s investments with a series of measures to be implemented by the end of May that year.\n\nThe measures included installing metering stations to monitor how much oil was being pumped to customers, and therefore how much money the ventures should be earning. Rosneft wanted an independent assessor to track how the joint ventures spent money. And it wanted PDVSA to stop hiring its own subsidiaries without signing a contract. Reuters couldn\u2019t determine whether the measures were put into action.\n\nA few months later, in October 2015, Rosneft First Vice President Eric Liron reported to Sechin that there was still disagreement with PDVSA on settling accounts with the joint ventures. Liron wrote in a memo to Sechin: \u201cAs of 15.08.2015, PDVSA is in technical default.\u201d\n\nMonths of efforts to get the money \u2013 in which Rosneft\u2019s Venezuela office and senior executives at headquarters engaged in negotiations with PDVSA officials \u2013 went nowhere. The Rosneft internal auditor stated in the November 2015 email to his colleague that the problem was \u201cunresolved because of the poor financial health of our partner\u201d - a reference to PDVSA.\n\nDiscussing a proposal to push the internal deadline for fixing the problem to a later date, the auditor asked sardonically what would be the point. \u201cWill it (PDVSA) return to health by then, or will it die and the question will no longer be relevant?\u201d he wrote in the same email.\n\nThe auditor left Rosneft in 2016, according to his LinkedIn profile. He did not respond to a message seeking comment.\n\nRosneft was supposed to receive its share of the revenue from oil sales in the form of dividends. As of the fourth quarter of 2015, Rosneft internal presentations showed that the company was owed dividends from three of its joint ventures. The total shortfall was $337 million. The presentations listed among the strategic aims of each of the three projects: \u201cReceiving unpaid dividends\u201d from PDVSA.\n\nSince the period covered by the documents, Rosneft has acted to take greater control of its investments, for example by bringing in its own contractors. Rosneft says PDVSA has paid off much of its debt. In a financial report released on Feb. 5, 2019, Rosneft said the loans it extended to PDVSA, which had totalled about $6.5 billion, were now down to $2.3 billion.\n\nBut serious challenges remain.\n\nRosneft\u2019s own reports and assessments by energy analysts show the company\u2019s projects in Venezuela are today still producing less oil than originally anticipated, with development plans either shelved or behind schedule.\n\nRosneft\u2019s flagship joint venture in Venezuela, the Junin-6 field, is still stuck in the exploration and test production phase, Rosneft wrote in its 2017 annual report. An executive at Russian partner Gazpromneft went further, saying the project is now \u201ccommercially pointless.\u201d The executive did not elaborate. Rosneft did not reply to Reuters questions about the commercial viability of the project.\n\nAdditional reporting by Oksana Kobzeva, Anton Zverev, Olesya Astakhova, Katya Golubkova, Olga Yagova, Gabrielle Tetrault-Farber, Vladimir Soldatkin, Alexander Ershov, Gleb Gorodyankin, Tatiana Ustinova and Margarita Popova in Moscow; Dmitry Zhdannikov in London; Marianna Parraga in Mexico City; Brian Ellsworth, Vivian Sequera, Alexandra Ulmer and Luc Cohen in Caracas.\n\nBillions spent, little to show Reuters estimates that after sinking more than $9 billion into Venezuela in loans, acquisitions and project spending since 2010, Rosneft, which is majority owned by the Russian state, has yet to show a profit. At the end of 2018, Rosneft had spent approximately $1.5 billion more in Venezuela than it had earned in the form of oil allocated to it as dividends, according to Reuters\u2019 calculations. This figure is reached by calculating the value of oil Rosneft received from its joint venture projects and subtracting from that outstanding loans Rosneft issued to PDVSA, official payments Rosneft made to Venezuela for access to oil fields, Rosneft capital expenditure on the ventures, and the cost of extracting Rosneft\u2019s share of the oil. The cost figures are based on a benchmark for operational expenditure in Venezuela of $15 per barrel. Rosneft did not respond to a request for comment. The Reuters estimate of Rosneft\u2019s financial shortfall in Venezuela could be conservative because it does not take into account tax Rosneft had to pay in Venezuela. This tax rate is not publicly disclosed, but Caracas normally takes at least 50 percent of the value of each barrel of oil. The estimate also does not include instances where PDVSA, according to documents reviewed by Reuters, failed to give Rosneft the share of oil production at joint projects that the Russian company believed it was due. Nor does it include cases where Rosneft had to sink extra capital expenditure into fields and plug unexpected holes in the joint ventures\u2019 balance sheets. In April last year, energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said its forecast for peak production at the Junin-6 field was now 120,000 barrels per day - half as much as Rosneft\u2019s internal documents forecast back in 2015, and just over a quarter of the 450,000 barrels initially predicted. The Boqueron field and Petroperija joint ventures were loss-making, Rosneft said in its financial report for 2018. At the Patao, Mejillones and Rio Caribe offshore gas prospects, which Venezuela signed over to Rosneft in 2017, there was no development plan or infrastructure plan in place, Wood Mackenzie said last year. The Petromonagas project \u2013 where Rosneft had planned to increase output - has also been falling short of hopes, internal PDVSA documents show. As of last July, it was pumping less oil per day than it had in 2015.\n\nOrinoco swamp By Christian Lowe and Rinat Sagdiev Photo editing: Simon Newman Design: Catherine Tai Edited by Janet McBride, Mike Collett-White and Richard Woods",

    "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices edged higher on Tuesday, supported by signs of tightening global supply after a Saudi official said the kingdom plans to cut oil exports in April, while the U.S. government reduced its forecast for domestic crude output growth.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Drilling rigs are parked up in the Cromarty Firth near Invergordon, Scotland, Britain January 27, 2015. REUTERS/Russell Cheyne\n\nSaudi Arabia, seeking to drain a supply glut and support prices, plans to cut its crude oil exports next month to below 7 million barrels per day (bpd), while keeping its output well below 10 million bpd, a Saudi official said on Monday.\n\nBrent crude futures rose 9 cents, or 0.1 percent, to settle at $66.67 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 8 cents, or 0.1 percent, to settle at $56.87 a barrel.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, both benchmarks have risen around 25 percent.\n\nCrude has been supported since the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia, returned to supply cuts as of Jan. 1. The group, known as OPEC+, agreed to reduce supply by 1.2 million bpd for six months.\n\nSaudi Arabia has voluntarily cut its supply by more than the deal requires and in April will keep output \u201cwell below\u201d 10 million bpd, the Saudi official said - less than the 10.311 million bpd the kingdom had agreed to pump.\n\nOn Sunday, Saudi oil minister Khalid al-Falih said it would be too early to change OPEC+ output policy at the group\u2019s meeting in April.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates in February exceeded its OPEC target for oil output cuts, achieving 119 percent of its goal, the country\u2019s energy minister said on Tuesday at an energy conference.\n\nA host of involuntary supply curbs in OPEC members, caused by unrest in Libya and U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela, have also boosted prices.\n\nIn addition, Venezuela\u2019s state-run oil firm PDVSA has been unable to resume crude exports from its primary port since a power outage last week, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.\n\nIn the United States, domestic crude production is expected to grow more slowly than previously anticipated in 2019, averaging about 12.3 million bpd, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said.\n\n\u201cPart of the pushback against OPEC+ efforts has been this idea of unrelenting growth in U.S. oil production, primarily shale.

Those EU countries want a presidential election to resolve Venezuela\u2019s problems.\n\nBut Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras\u2019 Syriza party has friendly ties with left-wing parties in South America and has expressed support for Maduro.\n\nMorales met with Tsipras in Athens on a rare trip to Europe, and called on the Greek prime minister to press the EU to push for talks between the Venezuelan government and opposition as a way out of the crisis.\n\n\u201cI have expressed by serious concern at the situation in Venezuela, with the deepening financial and humanitarian crisis,\u201d Tsipras said. \u201cThe only option in the coming days is a dialogue involving all sides \u2014 from the government and the opposition \u2014 to sit at the same negotiating table and avoid an the escalation of the crisis and possibility a bloody civil conflict.\u201d\n\nA senior government official in Athens told The Associated Press that Greece did not have a \u201cfront seat\u201d in international negotiations involving Venezuela but was pressing other EU countries to insist in trying to reach a negotiated settlement. The official, who spoke ahead of Morales\u2019 visit, asked not to be named pending official statements.\n\nLate Thursday, Morales accused Guaido of acting like a colonial-era \u201cviceroy,\u201d and criticized the support he has received from the U.S.\n\n\u201cWe do not agree with this outside interference ... solutions must be found inside the country,\u201d he said Friday.\n\nReferring to Tsipras as \u201cbrother Alexis,\u201d Morales said he was seeking Greek support in often-troubled trade negotiations between the EU and South American countries and said his government would receive advice from experts in Athens to try and emulate Greece\u2019s \u201ctourism miracle.\u201d\n\nLast year, more than 30 million tourists visited Greece, a country with a population of 10.7 million.\n\nBoth Tsipras and Morales are seeking re-election this year and promised to work to broaden international cooperation between left-wing parties.\n\nFOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM.",

    "title": "Senators introduce bipartisan bill to send $400 million in aid to Venezuela",
    "description": "Nicol\u00e1s Maduro's government has recently escalated its efforts to fend off the leadership challenge by the U.S.-backed opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3",
    "text": "Washington \u2014 A bipartisan group of senators introduced legislation Wednesday to authorize $400 million in humanitarian aid to crisis-stricken Venezuela and intensify the U.S. campaign to isolate the increasingly authoritarian government of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who has held on to power despite international pressure for him to step down.\n\nThe bill, spearheaded by Senate Foreign Affairs Committee ranking member Sen. Bob Menendez, also directs the State Department to work with European governments to replicate U.S. efforts and issue their own sanctions. The New Jersey Democrat, a longtime leader of U.S. foreign policy in Latin America, said \"internationalizing\" sanctions would increase pressure on the Maduro regime and its chief allies around the world.\n\n\"That is something that would be incredibly powerful, knowing that the sanctions that would levied are not just by the United States against the Maduro regime, but internationally,\" Menendez told CBS News during a conference call with reporters Wednesday. \"That's something that could significantly change the dynamics.\"\n\n\"It sends Maduro a message, as well as Russia and China that are helping to prop up Maduro,\" he added, referring to the Chinese government's investments in Venezuela and Moscow's military and political support for the South American country's socialist government.\n\nFourteen lawmakers signed on as sponsors of the legislation, known as the \"Venezuela Emergency Relief, Democracy Assistance, and Development Act of 2019,\" or \"VERDAD Act,\" the Spanish word for truth. Sens. Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and John Cornyn are among the Republican sponsors of the bill, with Democratic Sens. Dick Durbin, Ben Cardin and Tim Kaine also lending support.\n\nIn addition to doubling the Trump administration's $200 million humanitarian assistance pledge to the people of Venezuela, the legislation instructs the U.S. government to devise a strategy to investigate and repurpose the assets of the Venezuelan government and its officials.\n\nThe bill, if enacted, would also impose visa restrictions on family members of high-ranking officials within the socialist Venezuelan government. The officials would be allowed to request a waiver to the restrictions on their families' travel if they have not been involved in human rights abuses and if they vouch their support for National Assembly Juan Guaid\u00f3, the U.S.-backed opposition leader.\n\nMaduro's government has recently escalated its efforts to fend off the leadership challenge by Guaid\u00f3, who is supported by the Trump administration and more than four dozen countries. On Tuesday, the Constituent Assembly, a pro-government legislative body, voted to strip the 35-year-old opposition leader of his parliamentary immunity, which could make his arrest easier.\n\nThe chief of justice of the Maduro-allied Supreme Court has called on Guaid\u00f3 to be prosecuted for violating a travel ban issued by the 35-member tribunal earlier this year. The opposition leader was also barred from public office for 15 years by the government's comptroller, who alleged Guaid\u00f3 received funds from unauthorized sources and lied in his financial disclosures.\n\nMenendez, who called the Constituent Assembly \"illegitimate,\" said the recent moves by Maduro's government raise concerns about Guaid\u00f3's safety and suggest the regime may try to arrest him. \"We have to take that rather seriously, and the world has to take it seriously.\"\n\nOnce one of Latin America's wealthiest economies, oil-rich Venezuela has been grappling with mounting inflation and food and medicine shortages for the past couple of years under Maduro's administration, which blames U.S.-led sanctions for the country's economic woes. The dire situation has led to persistent civil unrest and prompted more than 2.3 million Venezuelans to flee the country since 2014, according to Human Rights Watch.\n\nDespite a growing coalition of governments calling for him to relinquish power, Maduro has managed to cling to power and secure the loyalty of the country's military.",

    "text": "March 4, 2019, 7:29 PM GMT By Associated Press\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 Declaring he knows he is at risk, Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido returned Monday to his homeland to renew his campaign to topple the government of President Nicolas Maduro.\n\nGuaido, 35, landed at the country\u2019s main airport, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) from Caracas, the capital. He said in a tweet that he successfully passed through immigration checks.\n\n\u201cWe know the risks that we face, that\u2019s never stopped us,\u201d the leader of the National Assembly said as he moved through a crowd that included several Western ambassadors. The United States and about 50 other countries have recognized Guaido as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate leader, arguing that last year\u2019s reelection of Maduro was illegitimate because popular opposition candidates were barred from running.\n\n\u201cThe regime must understand, the dictatorship must understand ... that we\u2019re stronger than ever. We\u2019ll continue protesting, we\u2019ll continue mobilizing,\u201d said Guaido, who had ignored an official ban on foreign travel to leave Venezuela, first for Colombia and then elsewhere in Latin America.\n\nBesides Colombia, Guaido visited Brazil, Argentina and Ecuador over the past week -- all countries that support his campaign against Maduro.\n\nGuaido has called for nationwide demonstrations coinciding with his arrival. Thousands of supporters heeded the call, peacefully gathering at a Caracas plaza and in other locations around the country. Some people carried the national flag.\n\nGuaido, who has declared himself interim president, said the goal of his return is to intensify internal pressure on Maduro.\n\nU.S. national security adviser John Bolton tweeted that threats or action by Maduro\u2019s government against Guaido \u201cwill be met with a strong and significant response from the United States and the international community.\u201d\n\nMaduro has said he is the target of a U.S.-backed coup plot after the Trump administration joined dozens of other countries in recognizing Guaido as the rightful president of the nation that is in the midst of a political and humanitarian crisis.\n\nVenezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez did not directly address a question about whether Guaido faces arrest during a recent interview with Russian state-owned television channel RT. But she left open the possibility, saying Guaido had broken the law and is \u201ca Venezuelan who conspires with foreign governments to overthrow a constitutional government.\u201d\n\nMaduro, meanwhile, has urged Venezuelans to enjoy the carnival season slated for Monday and Tuesday, even though many people don\u2019t have the resources to travel to beaches and other holiday spots.\n\nOn Sunday, Maduro tweeted that Venezuelans nationwide are enjoying the carnival \u201cin peace and happiness.\u201d\n\nFOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM.",

    "description": "U.S backed opposition claims over 17 have died in power cuts",
    "text": "Caracas, Venezuela \u2014 Venezuelan officials reported blackouts easing in some areas Tuesday, while the chief prosecutor said opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 is being investigated for allegedly sabotaging the national power grid, whose collapse last week has inflicted misery on millions.\n\nThe announcement by Tarek William Saab, the attorney general, escalated the Venezuelan government's standoff with Guaid\u00f3, although there are questions about how aggressively authorities would move against a man who is staunchly supported by the United States as well as many Venezuelans.\n\nGuaid\u00f3, who is trying to oust President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and hold elections, blames corruption and incompetence for nearly a week of nationwide blackouts that deprived most of the already struggling population not just of electricity, but also water and communications.\n\nAdding to tension over Venezuela's fate, the United States said it was withdrawing its last diplomats still in Caracas. The U.S. State Department also said U.S. citizens residing or travelling in Venezuela should leave the country, a heightening of an advisory issued Jan. 29 that said they should \"strongly consider\" doing so.\n\n\"Bye-bye,\" Maduro said on national television after praising the professional conduct of James Story, the top-ranking diplomat at the U.S. Embassy. Maduro also said he would seek the help of allies Cuba, Russia, China and Iran in investigating his allegation a U.S. \"cyberattack\" targeted Venezuelan power facilities, which he claimed was launched from Houston and Chicago.\n\nBlackout in Venezuela strains humanitarian crisis\n\nThe U.S. has dismissed the Venezuelan government's accusation as absurd and an attempt to divert attention from its own chronic failings.\n\nMaduro's relatives turned away at border\n\nVenezuela's information minister, Jorge Rodriguez, said the power grid had been almost completely restored and that water service was also returning. However, anecdotal reports indicated continuing outages for many Venezuelans, who were already suffering from hyperinflation and shortages of food and medicine.\n\nCBS News' Manuel Bojorquez reported Monday that doctors have been reduced to performing emergency surgeries by flashlight since the power went out. Opposition groups say an estimated 17 people have died from lack of medical care, like dialysis, amid the power cuts.\n\nOn Tuesday, long lines of people converged again at springs in the mountains of Caracas to collect water in bottles because water pumps have been out of service without power.\n\nEven some relatives of Maduro couldn't stand the power outages, according to authorities in Colombia.\n\nThe leader's cousin, Argimiro Maduro, along with his spouse, children and extended relatives, tried to enter the neighboring country, seeking relief until power is restored in Venezuela, said Christian Kruger, Colombia's migration director.\n\nOpposition leader and Interim President of Venzuela Juan Guaid\u00f3 speaks during a demonstration against the blackout and the Nicolas Maduro government on March 12, 2019, in Caracas, Venezuela. Getty\n\nPermission was denied. Colombia, which views Maduro as an illegitimate leader and recognizes Guaid\u00f3 as Venezuela's interim president, will not allow Maduro's relatives to vacation while \"avoiding the reality of a people in agony,\" Kruger said.\n\nMaduro did not comment on the report that his family members tried to enter Colombia, though he has said he has been suffering alongside Venezuelans during the blackout.\n\nOne of the areas hit hardest by the power cuts that started Thursday evening is the city of Maracaibo, where widespread looting has occurred since Sunday. On Tuesday, areas of the city still had no power and debris lay in some streets. Hundreds of people looted nearly half the 270 shops in Maracaibo's Sambil mall, even dismantling doors and windows and taking them away, said Juan Carlos Koch, the mall's general manager.\n\nSaab, the chief prosecutor, said the case against Guaid\u00f3 also involves messages allegedly inciting people to rob and loot during power outages.\n\nGuaid\u00f3 is already under investigation for alleged instigation of violence, but authorities have not tried to detain him since he violated a ban on leaving the country and then returned a week ago from a Latin American tour. He said at a Caracas demonstration Tuesday that allegations that he sabotaged the power grid are false.\n\n\"The whole world knows who the saboteur is. Maduro is responsible,\" said Guaid\u00f3, who has accused the government of negligence and looting state resources for years.\n\nTrump calls for Venezuela's Maduro to give up power\n\nAuthorities also detained a Venezuelan journalist and activist and confiscated computers and cellphones from his home, human rights activists said. The arrest of Luis Carlos Diaz after he left Union Radio station Monday followed an accusation by a pro-government leader that he caused Venezuela's blackouts, Human Rights Watch said.\n\nMichelle Bachelet, the U.N high commissioner for human rights, said that she is concerned about Diaz and that a U.N. mission visiting Caracas asked authorities for access to him.",

    "title": "How the Green New Deal Is Forcing Politicians to Finally Address Climate Change",
    "description": "The Green New Deal, calling for the U.S. to decarbonize, is forcing all politicians to talk about climate change \u2014 not just the Democrats.",
    "text": "When a group of more than 20 protesters showed up in the halls of the U.S. Senate on a recent February day, they would have been forgiven for expecting a chilly reception. For the past seven months, sit-ins at a range of offices\u2013from California Governor Jerry Brown\u2019s to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi\u2019s\u2013had followed a similar pattern: show up, sing songs, get led away in handcuffs for disrupting the peace. But on that particular Wednesday, things were different.\n\nInstead of being dismissed or arrested, this band of environmental activists from a group known as the Sunrise Movement was warmly welcomed. Democratic Senators\u2019 aides applauded their songs, led them to back offices for meetings and cheered their efforts. \u201cIt starts with what you\u2019re doing, from the bottom on up,\u201d Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders told them. \u201cI just want to thank you.\u201d In the weeks that followed, Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer, after years of near radio silence on climate change, gave a series of speeches on the chamber floor. \u201cFor the first time in a long time, the Senate is finally debating the issue of climate change, and if you ask me, it\u2019s about time,\u201d he said. \u201cClimate change is an urgent crisis and an existential threat.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not just Democrats who suddenly want to focus on climate change. President Trump seized the opportunity to double down on his denial of climate science, while other Republicans began recalibrating their messaging. Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz, an ardent defender of the President who introduced a bill in 2017 to eliminate the EPA, responded to Trump by tweeting, \u201cClimate change is real.\u201d In December, John Cornyn of Texas, who until recently served in GOP Senate leadership, tweeted positively about a tax on carbon emissions, and a month later, Republican Representative Francis Rooney of Florida and Democratic colleagues joined to introduce a carbon-tax measure in the House.\n\nThis shift has been a long time coming. Scientists have understood for decades that climate change is happening and that humans are causing it; recent studies, including a landmark report in October from the U.N., have shown that things are even worse than we thought. Global temperatures have already risen 1\u00b0C since the Industrial Revolution; if the planet heats by much more than an additional half a degree, we could see some of the most catastrophic effects of climate change, including the death of the world\u2019s coral reefs and the inundation of entire island nations.\n\nThat reality has resonated with the public: more than 70% of Americans now understand that climate change is taking place, according to data from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. A February NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey found that two-thirds of Republicans believe their party is \u201coutside the mainstream\u201d on the issue.\n\nInto this new political reality came the Green New Deal\u2013equal parts policy proposal and battle cry. The resolution, introduced by Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts, calls for the U.S. to launch a broad \u201cmobilization\u201d to decarbonize the economy while tackling a slew of other social ills. The response was mixed. People loved it. People loathed it. Others were confused by it. But in D.C., where climate has long been relegated to third-tier status, lawmakers could no longer avoid the issue.\n\nSunrise Movement activists call for a Green New Deal on Capitol Hill Aurora Samperio\u2014NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\nWithin weeks of the proposal\u2019s release, Democrats competed to burnish their green credentials. Nearly every Democratic candidate for the 2020 presidential nomination has endorsed the Green New Deal. Washington Governor Jay Inslee entered the race on a climate-themed campaign\u2013something unthinkable just a few years ago, when Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump didn\u2019t field a single question about climate change in their presidential debates.\n\nSome Republicans scrambled to counter what they saw as a liberal threat: if they didn\u2019t come up with a viable climate position, at least one they could point to rhetorically, they risked further ceding the issue to the Democrats, whose proposal they decry as socialist overreach. Behind the scenes, Republicans gathered in working groups trying to grasp for a solution. Major corporations\u2013including in the oil-and-gas industry\u2013pulled out their checkbooks to support conservative climate measures.\n\nLove the Green New Deal or hate it, the conversation it has unleashed represents a shift in the discussion surrounding climate policy in the U.S., with ripples that will spread across the globe. The outcome of the debate will go a long way toward determining if humanity can avoid the most catastrophic consequences of a rapidly warming world.\n\nEven before Ocasio-Cortez released her Green New Deal resolution, critics had begun to scrutinize the program, using every detail as a chance to condemn it. A congressional newcomer, Ocasio-Cortez has developed a reputation for taking critics and their talking points head-on, but in a recent interview with TIME she rejected the idea that she should have to defend the particulars.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a statement. It\u2019s a vision document. And people want to pick it apart to death,\u201d she says, agreeing with those who liken her proposal to the \u201cbold persistent experimentation\u201d that President Franklin Roosevelt advocated to end the Great Depression. \u201cI hope that we start to get to more of an experimental spirit in government,\u201d she says.\n\nThe Green New Deal experiments indeed, calling for everything from massive government spending on clean-energy research and development to cleaning up polluted industrial sites, all in service of quickly weaning the U.S. off greenhouse-gas emissions and helping vulnerable communities. The pieces of the package seem jumbled, but they are built on a rich history of ideas. Thomas Friedman first coined the term Green New Deal in a 2007 New York Times column and described the program as government \u201cseeding basic research, providing loan guarantees where needed and setting standards, taxes and incentives.\u201d Van Jones, the activist and political commentator, published The Green Collar Economy in 2008, about solving inequality and climate change at the same time. Chapter 4, titled \u201cThe Green New Deal,\u201d outlined his vision for a program that would \u201cbirth a just and green economy.\u201d\n\nAround the same time, Inslee, then a Congressman, wrote Apollo\u2019s Fire, highlighting stories of Americans\u2019 benefiting from clean energy and calling for a moon-shot-like program to invest in a green economy. These ideas were so popular that Senators Barack Obama and John McCain pushed for green jobs in their 2008 presidential campaigns, and a handful of states have adopted some Green New Deal policies in recent years.\n\nIn California\u2019s agricultural region, for example, former Fresno mayor Ashley Swearengin, a Republican, initiated a comprehensive plan to establish new transit options and redevelop the local economy while reducing greenhouse-gas emissions by 40%. The state as a whole has a plan to achieve 100% carbon-free electricity, a vision that\u2019s gaining adherents in cities big and small and in a range of states from New Mexico to New York. \u201cIt\u2019s not radical. By no stretch of imagination,\u201d says Kevin de Le\u00f3n, a Democrat who spearheaded many of California\u2019s climate initiatives as president pro tempore of the state senate. California\u2019s GDP is larger than that of all but four countries and its economy continues to thrive, he says, dismissing the critique that environmental reform would kill economic growth.\n\nStill, the Green New Deal faces pushback not just from the political right but also from labor\u2013a longtime stalwart of the Democratic Party. In early March, the AFL-CIO published a stinging critique of the proposal, calling it unrealistic and a threat to \u201cmembers\u2019 jobs and their families\u2019 standard of living.\u201d The oil-and-gas industry in particular supports millions of jobs, and while the text of the Green New Deal calls for a \u201cjust transition\u201d to other industries, it offers few details. Republicans latched on to a talking point suggesting that the proposal would turn the U.S. into another Venezuela, pointing to the resolution\u2019s inclusion of a job guarantee and universal health care, goals that many Democrats agree have no place in a climate package.\n\nBut if this ambitious climate plan seemed likely to wrench lawmakers further apart, it may actually do the opposite. In an era of festering dysfunction in Congress, all the green talk has actually sprouted green shoots, encouraging a national discussion around climate and, improbably, creating an opportunity to push real legislation. \u201cIf you care about moving the solution up the agenda, you have to salute what\u2019s been accomplished here,\u201d says Eric Pooley, a senior vice president at the Environmental Defense Fund, which has not endorsed the Green New Deal. \u201cThe fact that there are different points of view on different policy instruments is healthy.\u201d\n\nA carbon tax\u2013once anathema to the right\u2013is an unlikely beneficiary of this environmental glasnost, gaining support on both sides of the aisle. \u201cIf your goal is to reduce carbon emissions, a carbon tax will do that,\u201d says Congressman John Delaney, a Maryland Democrat who is running for President and has introduced carbon-tax legislation. \u201cIt has an opportunity to get pretty broad support, including bipartisan support.\u201d\n\nCarlos Curbelo, a former GOP Florida Congressman who has led efforts for a carbon tax, said the Green New Deal offers a useful political foil. \u201cIt\u2019s going to give Republicans and conservatives something that they can clearly oppose, which is always appreciated by the right,\u201d he says. At the same time, he adds, Republicans are aware that public opinion is shifting. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be enough for a lot of members to say the Green New Deal is a massive socialist program. The next question is, What\u2019s your solution?\u201d\n\nDemocrats, of course, are happy to press that question. With the 2020 presidential campaign already under way, candidates are painting themselves as climate warriors. Nearly all of the dozen-plus Democratic hopefuls have endorsed a version of the Green New Deal, touted their environmental cred and described global warming as an existential threat.\n\nBut activists say most Democratic presidential candidates have a lot of catching up to do: while the party embraces climate science, that\u2019s not the same as proactively fighting to halt dangerous warming. For now, few campaigns are proposing more than restoring Obama-era rules like the Clean Power Plan and recommitting the U.S. to the Paris Agreement.\n\nSenator Elizabeth Warren, who has a 99% voting record from the League of Conservation Voters (LCV), has portrayed herself as the policy wonk among the presidential candidates, but she has introduced only one piece of climate legislation in her six years in the Senate, and her office lacks a dedicated climate staffer. Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand, who both serve on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, have drafted a flurry of bills to deal with everything from toxic chemicals to cleaning up polluted sites, but neither has introduced comprehensive legislation to reduce emissions. Beto O\u2019Rourke has come under fire for taking donations from people in the oil-and-gas industry. Kamala Harris, who joined the Senate in 2017, has a 100% score from the LCV but hasn\u2019t proposed any significant climate legislation.\n\nThere are exceptions. Sanders, who has a long record of introducing climate legislation big and small in the Senate, plans to unveil a broad environmental plan. It is expected to include massive investment in infrastructure, the elimination of fossil-fuel subsidies and a ban on fossil-fuel extraction on public lands. Inslee and Delaney have both promised big on climate. Inslee says the issue will be a centerpiece of his presidency, while Delaney says a carbon-tax proposal could be enacted in his first 100 days.\n\nBut both Inslee and Delaney have thus far attracted only minimal support in presidential polls, and many Democrats fear that climate policy will fade as an issue if it isn\u2019t a focus on the campaign trail. Indeed, many environmental leaders are still upset at President Obama for allowing cap-and-trade legislation to die in the Senate in 2009 after it passed the House. \u201cWhen Democratic leaders see climate as a No. 7 issue,\u201d says Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Rhode Island Democrat who has delivered more than 200 climate speeches on the Senate floor, \u201cit stays a No. 7 issue.\u201d\n\nBehind the scenes, the energy surrounding the Green New Deal debate in D.C. has pushed top national Democrats to develop a policy that is both ambitious and workable. Before the current session of Congress began, House Speaker Pelosi responded to demands for a Green New Deal by creating a House select committee charged with laying the ground for climate legislation. In recent weeks, a group of Democratic staffers have convened in regular meetings led by Hawaii Senator Brian Schatz\u2019s office to discuss a path forward on climate legislation. In the meantime, some members of Congress may introduce bits of Green New Deal\u2013related legislation that they think could actually pass Congress now, like a proposal from Sanders on water infrastructure.\n\nCongressional Republicans, feeling the shifting politics, have begun exploring policies that could answer the Democrats. GOP Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Cory Gardner of Colorado, both of whom are up for re-election next year, established a group for Republican members of Congress in February called the Roosevelt Conservation Caucus that looks for \u201cmarket-based approaches\u201d to environmental problems. Other GOP lawmakers have convened behind closed doors to discuss what ideas they can bring to the table. That\u2019s a tall order for a party whose officials have ignored or denied the issue in recent years, and it remains to be seen whether the efforts will drive any wholesale change.\n\nThe private sector may help. In recent years, major oil-and-gas companies have slowly drifted away from long-standing opposition to climate policy. For an industry that thinks in decades-long time frames, federal legislation to combat climate change now seems inevitable, and industry leaders would rather see a conservative approach than a paradigm-shifting program like the Green New Deal. In recent months, a coalition of corporations has announced plans to spend millions of dollars lobbying for carbon-tax legislation paired with regulatory repeal and protection from climate-related lawsuits. For moderate lawmakers, it\u2019s becoming possible to imagine a grand compromise that could include some elements geared for both sides of the aisle, say, investing carbon-tax revenue in clean-energy research and development, with a tax cut elsewhere and support for ailing coal communities.\n\nBut any compromise would face the scrutiny of the activists who at last have helped make climate change a front-of-mind issue. Advocacy groups have promised to ensure that Democrats not only continue to talk about the environment but also commit to bold action. Piecemeal commitments from Democratic lawmakers will not suffice, they say, and weak measures from Republicans should be rejected out of hand. \u201cThere are people talking about how a Green New Deal is improving the tax code or people saying that putting a climate provision into the infrastructure package is the Green New Deal,\u201d says Varshini Prakash, executive director of the Sunrise Movement. \u201cAll of those things are good to do; they\u2019re not the Green New Deal.\u201d\n\nWhere does this leave all of us and the planet we inhabit? Even thinking optimistically, enacting climate-change legislation that matches the scale of the challenge is hard to imagine: the science is damning and the clock is ticking. And while the conversation may be shifting, there\u2019s still a climate-change-denying President in the White House and nothing like a broad consensus on a path forward among Democrats.\n\nIn the face of all that, it would be easy to dismiss the new breed of climate activists as noisy but dreamy, idealists distant from the powers who run the show. But that\u2019s the thing about social movements, from civil rights to gay rights. At first the activists may look naive, and maybe they are. But in the rearview mirror, they come to look like instigators of massive and, in hindsight, obvious change.\n\n\u2013With reporting by Charlotte ALTER/WASHINGTON\n\nWrite to Justin Worland at justin.worland@time.com.\n\nThis appears in the April 01, 2019 issue of TIME.",

    "description": "About 1,000 members of the Venezuelan security forces have fled to Colombia since last month, abandoning Nicolas Maduro's government, Colombian authorities said.",
    "text": "March 18, 2019, 8:55 PM GMT By Associated Press\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 About 1,000 members of the Venezuelan security forces have fled to Colombia since last month, giving up weapons and uniforms as they abandoned the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, Colombian authorities said Monday.\n\nColombia's foreign ministry released the updated number of Venezuelan police and military personnel who crossed the border, many around the time of a Feb. 23 attempt by opposition leader Juan Guaido to deliver U.S.-provided humanitarian aid to Venezuela. The attempt failed because Venezuelan forces blocked trucks trying to cross from Colombia into Venezuela.\n\nThe deserters have received lodging, health care and legal aid, and were accompanied by some 400 family members, Colombian officials said. Colombia, the United States and about 50 other countries support Guaido's claim that he is the interim president of Venezuela and that Maduro is illegitimate because his re-election last year was marred by irregularities.\n\nDespite the desertions, Maduro has retained the support of Venezuela's key military leaders, who are considered pivotal in determining the outcome of the country's power struggle. Maduro alleges that Guaido is a collaborator in a U.S. plot to overthrow the government in Venezuela, whose population is enduring hyperinflation and a scarcity of medicine and other necessities.\n\nMore than 3 million Venezuelans have fled the country in recent years, about one-third of them finding refuge in Colombia.\n\nNearly a week after Venezuela's worst blackouts inflicted more hardship across the country, Maduro was said to be planning a Cabinet reshuffle. Vice President Delcy Rodriguez made the announcement on Twitter on Sunday, though she did not provide details. Some past reshuffles have entailed rotations of ministers rather than a major overhaul of leadership.\n\nKey Cabinet figures include Rodriguez, a former foreign minister; Information Minister Jorge Rodriguez, brother of the vice president; and Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino Lopez, a military general. All face U.S. sanctions for alleged corruption and human rights violations.\n\nGuaido on Monday scoffed at the report of Cabinet changes, telling journalists that it merely reflects how the government is weakening and \"without answers.\"\n\nHe again said that the nationwide power outages were the result of government corruption and mismanagement and not, as Maduro claimed, an act of sabotage directed by the United States.\n\nU.S. and Russian officials, meanwhile, were meeting in Rome this week to discuss the crisis in Venezuela.\n\nElliott Abrams, the U.S. special envoy for Venezuela, was to hold talks with Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov on Monday and Tuesday, the U.S. State Department said. Ryabkov said in comments carried by Russian media that, \"We will do everything to protect our cooperation with Caracas.\"\n\nMoscow supports Maduro while Washington has imposed oil sanctions on Venezuela in an attempt to push Maduro from power.\n\nFOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM.",

    "description": "Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido plans to meet with public employee unions to \u201crecover\u201d the state bureaucracy, which he says is being manipulated by Nicolas Maduro.",
    "text": "March 5, 2019, 3:33 PM GMT By The Associated Press\n\nOpposition leader Juan Guaido shrouded the route and timing of his return in secrecy amid concerns he might be detained by Venezuela\u2019s government. Yet he breezed through airport immigration checks and brazenly called for the downfall of President Nicolas Maduro at a rally where the presence of security forces was minimal.\n\nGuaido\u2019s homecoming Monday followed warnings to by the United States and other countries to Maduro not to move against his adversary, and he possibly realized arresting his foe could generate more street protests. And, while Guaido\u2019s presence is likely to add at least short-term momentum to his campaign for political change, Maduro has proven resilient and still commands the critical loyalty of top military officers.\n\nVenezuela is gripped by a humanitarian crisis that is expected to worsen as U.S. oil sanctions designed to put more pressure on Maduro take their toll. With both political factions holding firm amid increasing deprivation for Venezuelans, some analysts speculate that they might be considering negotiations on an end to the standoff.\n\nThe fact that Guaido was not detained, at least so far, reflects the pressure Maduro faces not to intervene, said Luis Vicente Leon, head of the Caracas-based polling firm Datanalisis. \u201cBut it seems to indicate the beginning of a negotiation, local and international, whose details are not yet clear,\u201d Leon said in a tweet.\n\nFor now, Guaido, leader of the opposition-controlled National Assembly, seems intent on probing Maduro\u2019s socialist government for vulnerabilities. He planned to meet Tuesday with public employee unions, tweeting that the meeting is meant to \u201crecover\u201d the state bureaucracy, which he says is being manipulated by Maduro\u2019s government for political benefit.\n\nHe also called for big protests on Saturday, a tactic that has sometimes been countered by Maduro loyalists with flag-waving rallies of their own.\n\nOn Monday, Guaido showed off his passport before climbing onto scaffolding and pumping his fist during the demonstration in Caracas, delighting euphoric followers. There was no immediate comment from Maduro\u2019s government, which sought to focus the public\u2019s attention on Carnival festivities Monday and Tuesday.\n\nStill, while thousands of Venezuelans heeded Guaido\u2019s call for protests coinciding with his return, many worry the government might crack down on the opposition as it has in the past, jailing or driving into exile top opposition leaders.\n\n\u201cWe know the risks that we face. That\u2019s never stopped us,\u201d Guaido said.\n\nHe was greeted at the country\u2019s main airport by top diplomats from the United States, Germany, Spain and other countries who possibly hoped to head off any move to detain Guaido by bearing witness to his return.\n\n\u201cWe hope there won\u2019t be any escalation and that parliamentary immunity is respected,\u201d said Spanish Ambassador Jesus Silva Fernandez.\n\nThe United States and some 50 other countries have recognized Guaido as the legitimate leader of Venezuela, arguing that Maduro\u2019s re-election last year was invalid \u2014 partly because popular opposition candidates were barred from running. Maduro has accused those nations of participating in a U.S.-backed coup plot against him.\n\nGuaido, who left Venezuela last month despite a court order banning him from foreign travel, visited Colombia, Brazil, Paraguay, Argentina and Ecuador. The governments of those countries support his claim to be Venezuela\u2019s interim president and have urged Maduro to resign so the country can prepare for free and fair elections.\n\nThe United States congratulated the opposition leader on his return home.\n\n\u201cThe international community must unite and push for the end of Maduro\u2019s brutal regime and the peaceful restoration of democracy in Venezuela,\u201d U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said.\n\nColombian President Ivan Duque tweeted that Guaido\u2019s homecoming was part of the \u201cirreversible path that Venezuela has taken toward democracy.\u201d\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for dialogue by all parties to end the political impasse.\n\nAmong the demonstrators who waited for Guaido at the Caracas rally was Wilfredo Moya, a former construction worker who said Venezuelans hoping for change should be patient.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long process,\u201d he said.\n\nFOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM.",

    "text": "As Venezuela's Blackout Drags On, Protesters Fill The Streets Of Caracas\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Matias Delacroix/AFP/Getty Images Matias Delacroix/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn the midst of one of the most extensive power outages in Venezuelan history, the country's opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 urged his supporters on Saturday to mobilize against the government of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro.\n\n\"Venezuela, let's go to the streets,\" Guaid\u00f3, who declared himself interim president in January with endorsements from dozens of countries, said in a video on Twitter in response to the massive blackout blanketing most of the nation.\n\nMaduro, without offering evidence, blamed the outage that started Thursday afternoon on the United States, calling it an \"electricity war.\" The blackout appears to have stemmed from a failure at the main hydroelectric plant in Venezuela, which has suffered from years of underinvestment. Guaid\u00f3 claimed the outage knocked out power in 22 of the country's 23 states.\n\nBy Saturday morning, power began to restore in the capital Caracas, but remained off for large portions of the country. State utility workers estimate it will be days before the national grid is completely restored, according to The New York Times.\n\nProtesters showed up in the the streets of Caracas in open defiance of a ban by the Maduro government on political rallies in the heart of the capital. NPR's Philip Reeves reports the rallies were particularly remarkable considering it wasn't easy for demonstrators to get there with the subway system out of service and a massive deployment of police, National Guard and army soldiers blocking the roads.\n\nMaduro held his own rally inside the presidential palace for supporters, who believe they are the victim of a coup by the White House, Reeves reports.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption YURI CORTEZ/AFP/Getty Images YURI CORTEZ/AFP/Getty Images\n\nIn a tweet, Maduro said the U.S. is desperate to gain access to Venezuela's natural resources, but that Venezuelans will stand firm and defend their land. He concluded \"Yankee go home! We are anti-imperialist!\"\n\nAfter more than six weeks of uncertainty, many opposition supporters on the streets were frustrated.\n\n\"Now we don't have lights, we don't have water.

    "text": "\n\nA Maduro supporter holds a poster with a no symbol over a defaced image of President Trump, and a message that reads in Spanish: \u201cStay out Venezuela Trump.\u201d (Natacha Pisarenko/AP)\n\nWhen President Trump took questions at his March 19 news conference with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a reporter asked what he thought about possibly using military force to remove Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Trump\u2019s answer was, \u201cI think of all possibilities. All options are open.\u201d The Trump administration has repeatedly stated the United States will not \u201crule out\u201d military intervention in Venezuela because \u201cevery option is on the table.\u201d\n\nTwo months ago, Trump recognized National Assembly leader Juan Guaid\u00f3, who declared himself Venezuela\u2019s interim president in January. Increasing numbers of Venezuelans \u2014 and foreign governments \u2014 have backed Guaid\u00f3 and rejected the contested presidency of Maduro, but the country remains in a political stalemate. What happens next?\n\nDebate over whether to invade a Latin American country has been far less common in this century than the last, but there is currently a high-level public discussion around the world about whether to use force in Venezuela to end the Maduro regime. Venezuelans are suffering from hunger, lack of electricity and medicine, hyperinflation and political repression \u2014 and the humanitarian crisis has put the country in the global media spotlight.\n\nWhy is the United States so involved? And what would an armed intervention mean for the future of Venezuelan democracy? Here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\n1. The U.S. has historically involved itself in Latin American politics\n\nThere\u2019s a long history here. Most analyses of U.S.-Latin American relations share common assumptions that there is a power imbalance, and that the United States will play a central role in any Latin American political crisis, perceiving the region as its backyard. There are many examples of U.S. intervention, including use of military force.\n\nDepending on your theoretical or empirical tastes, these factors matter because the United States will seek to project economic power, choose unilateral options, and perceive an inferior Latin America in need of U.S. improvement \u2014 or employ force to appease domestic constituents.\n\n[Trump\u2019s challenge to Venezuela\u2019s president could lead to a military occupation. Here\u2019s why \u2014 and why that\u2019s dangerous.]\n\nAt the same time, U.S. power should not blind us to Latin American agency, which influences U.S. policy decisions and autonomous foreign policy capacity in the region. Latin American influence can both shape and strengthen U.S. initiatives. Latin American leaders have successfully argued or cajoled to inject their opinions into U.S. policy deliberations.\n\nIn 2015, the Obama administration declared Venezuela a national security threat, following months of protests and subsequent government repression. That declaration opened the door for sanctions against individuals in the Maduro government. The administration\u2019s logic was that economic pressure would encourage military defection and compel the regime either to democratize or collapse, but neither happened.\n\nIn 2017, President Trump stated that his administration had \u201cmany options for Venezuela, including a possible military option, if necessary,\u201d which added a credible threat of violence. However, neither sanctions nor threats produced regime change or free elections.\n\nCiting the fraudulent 2018 presidential election, in early 2019 Guaid\u00f3 controversially invoked the constitution to proclaim Nicol\u00e1s Maduro as usurper and himself as interim president. The Trump administration then recognized Guaid\u00f3 as the legitimate leader of Venezuela and expanded sanctions further to include the state-owned oil company, which is Venezuela\u2019s source of hard currency. The U.S. policy logic remained focused on military defection, ramping up the pressure on the Venezuelan economy.\n\n2. Armed intervention does not typically lead to democracy\n\nThe discussion of U.S. armed intervention stems from the failure of these policy tools to achieve their goals. The literature both on democratic transitions and on U.S.-Latin American relations tells us something empirically about how desirable this option should be.\n\nThe odds are not good that a military intervention would succeed.\n\nArmed intervention would constitute a transition by \u201cimposition,\u201d whereby one country or political faction imposes the rules of the game. The literature suggests this approach yields a less democratic result \u2014 by definition it excludes some groups or individuals. After World War II, \u201cexternally monitored installation\u201d worked to reestablish Germany and Japan \u2014 but these conditions are not present in Venezuela.\n\nAnd research suggests military intervention is much less likely to produce a successful outcome in poor and diverse countries. Instead, aid to peaceful opponents is more conducive to democratization than military intervention.\n\n[Here are the 3 big shifts in Venezuela that you probably missed \u2014 and will change what comes next.]\n\nVenezuelans remain highly polarized, and a foreign-imposed transition would likely alienate a significant portion of the population and encourage electoral authoritarianism \u2014 where a government allows elections but controls them tightly and limits opposition participation.\n\nThose who see invasion as a good option point to the U.S. invasion of Panama as a successful example because a dictatorship was ousted and democracy \u2014 though highly flawed \u2014 emerged. However, scholars point to how small Panama is in comparison to Venezuela, and how deeply embedded the United States already was in Panama.\n\n3. U.S. armed intervention has been bad for Latin Americans\n\nResearch on U.S.-Latin American relations point to the historical use of force in bilateral relations and how it consistently undermined Latin American democracy. It contributed to militarization and violence (even to the point of fostering a \u201ckilling zone\u201d), increased state repression, privileged the military over civilians and strengthened economic elites.\n\nWhat would this mean in Venezuela? There\u2019s a high risk that U.S. military intervention would involve long-term occupation, and undermine democracy and increase violence in the long term. Latin American political leaders long ago advocated multilateralism and nonintervention as core elements of foreign policy, simply for self-protection. Military action against Venezuela would therefore sour regional relations \u2014 particularly since even allies have spoken out against this approach.\n\n[Four reasons it\u2019ll be hard to offer Maduro a golden parachute (and one reason to try anyway)]\n\nBecause of its relative power and its historical interest in the region, inevitably the United States becomes deeply involved in Latin American political crises. This is not likely to change anytime soon. Research tells us that the policy options most conducive to democracy are nonviolent, multilateral and consensual. If democracy is the true goal, then attacking Venezuela is unlikely to lead in that direction.\n\nGregory Weeks is associate dean for academic affairs and professor of political science at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.

    "title": "Transcript: Sen. Tim Kaine on \"Face the Nation\"",
    "description": "The following is a transcript of the interview with Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia that aired Sunday, March 17, 2019, on \"Face the Nation\"",
    "text": "The following is a transcript of the interview with Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia that aired Sunday, March 17, 2019, on \"Face the Nation.\"\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Late last night we spoke with Virginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, he had just returned from a visit to the Venezuelan border and spoke to us from Bogota, Colombia. We asked Senator Kaine about President Trump saying that he did not think white nationalism was a rising threat around the world.\n\nSENATOR TIM KAINE: Margaret, it is on the rise and the president should call it out but sadly he's not doing that. We saw in the aftermath of the horrible attack in Charlottesville that he tried to say that the white supremacists, neo-Nazis, neo confederates there were just, you know, good people. But when you see church shootings in Charleston, a synagogue shooting in Pittsburgh, you see this hate filled manifesto of the shooter in New Zealand who is murdering Muslims, we have to confront the fact that there is a rise in white supremacy, anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim attitudes. The president uses language often that's very similar to the language used by these bigots and racists. And if he's not going to call it out then other leaders have to do more to call it out and I certainly will.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well the president did say it was a horrible thing that happened but he said that the White Nationalism issue is just a small group of people that have very, very serious problems. What do you attribute the rise to?\n\nSEN. KAINE: Well they have problems but- I think the president is using language that emboldens them. He's not creating them. They're out there. But you know at the same time as he was tweeting out yesterday his support for the family members in New Zealand, and that was appropriate, he was vetoing the Senate's rejection of his emergency declaration from Thursday. And he used the word invaders to characterize people coming to the nation's southern borders which was exactly the same phrase that the shooter in New Zealand used to characterize the Muslims that he was attacking. That kind of language from the person who probably has the loudest microphone on the planet Earth is hurtful and dangerous and it tends to incite violence.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I want to ask you about an exchange you had this week that seemed quite tense. You were very clearly frustrated with the acting Secretary of Defense Shanahan because you were asking why a list of military projects had not been provided to Congress that would be directly impacted by funding cuts due to re-allocation for the president's border wall.\n\nSEN. KAINE: I'm on the Armed Services Committee. I represent Virginia. I have a child in the military so I sent a letter on February 15th to the secretary of defense and said if you're going to ransack the Pentagon's budget, tell me what projects you're going to cut or delay or eliminate. They wouldn't provide an answer. At the hearing on Thursday we-we're now going to vote that day on whether we support or reject the emergency declaration and they still hadn't answered our question, \"What projects are at stake?\" At the hearing he said \"Oh I'll send you the list later this afternoon.\"\n\nAnd you're right I kind of blew up at him. You're gonna give us the list after we vote? This is highly relevant to the vote about the president's emergency declaration. What projects are you going to ransack out of the Pentagon budget? Is it going to be military housing? Is it going to be trying to make our bases safer from terrorism with construction projects? Is it going to be rebuilding Tyndall Air Force Base that got blitzed in the hurricanes last fall? And they said they would give us the list after. But Margaret, to add insult to injury they had to walk that back. They don't even want to give us the list now at all we're going to have to have an override vote. I don't think the White House wants us to see the list before the override vote.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Why do you think the White House is withholding this information you say is so relevant because of an upcoming vote?\n\nSEN. KAINE: I think there's one reason.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You're- you're connecting. You think they're trying to influence the outcome of it.\n\nSEN. KAINE: Absolutely. This is not the Secretary of Defense in my view, this is the White House wanting to hold the list back because they worry that if senators and House members saw the potential projects that were going to be ransacked to pay for the president's wall, they would lose votes. And I think they're going to try to hide the list until that veto override vote occurs in the House and then in the Senate.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You are of course in Colombia nearby. What is a country that is really crippled in many ways economically right now, Venezuela. There are about 3 million refugees who have fled, the energy and oil industry is collapsing as is the economy there. What is it that you were going to the border to see? What did you learn?\n\nSEN. KAINE: Well Margaret I wanted to see a couple of things. One, to support the Colombian government because their effort to provide assistance to these millions of Venezuelanos has been really momentous. But secondly, learn what more the United States can do. We have worked together actually in an accord between the administration and Congress to provide significant amounts of humanitarian aid, to- to work together, to pull together a coalition of nations.\n\n\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Right. But as you know, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro still is in charge of that country whether we like it or not. And these sanctions have not seemingly changed his calculus. The visas, the diplomatic isolation, what is this actually accomplishing at this point?\n\nSEN. KAINE: Well it's- it's giving hope to Venezuelans that their fina- there may finally be some change. The question isn't whether Maduro likes it or not, the question is what the Venezuelan people want. And the National Assembly has determined that the election of President Mazur- Maduro was illegitimate. There needs to be a new- new government. So what more can we do more?\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah.\n\nSEN. KAINE: More humanitarian aid, more work together to pull more nations into our coalition. The sanctions are important. They're having an effect. Sanctions are economic but they're also visa restrictions on Maduro and his cronies as they try to travel abroad. We need to give hope to the Venezuelan people that we stand with them and support them. It's a massive humanitarian crisis driven by one person, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, and the Venezuelan people are speaking out and they want something better.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Has the Trump administration whose policy you seem to support right now, have they underestimated how strong he is?\n\nSEN. KAINE: I don't know that they've underestimated it. Look, this is- this is not easy. It's a difficult situation. And I do generally support what the Trump administration has done with one exception, I think loose talk about U.S. military action is a big mistake. One, because that's not for the president, it's for Congress. But second, the right strategy here-- there's only one person using the military against Venezuelans and it's Maduro.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Senator Kaine thank you for joining us, safe travels.\n\nKAINE: Thanks Margaret. Absolutely.",

    "title": "Trump admin to let Americans sue some foreign firms doing business in Cuba",
    "description": "The Trump admin has long sought ways to toughen the U.S. economic embargo on Cuba and has rolled back some measures enacted by the Obama administration.",
    "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nMarch 4, 2019, 9:37 AM GMT / Updated March 4, 2019, 8:46 PM GMT By Josh Lederman, Abigail Williams and Mary Murray\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Trump administration said Monday it will allow unprecedented lawsuits in American courts against Cuban companies using property seized during the 1959 revolution, as it works to discourage more of the foreign investment in Cuba that provides the island's economy with a lifeline.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo issued a 30-day \"partial waiver\" to a law known as the Libertad or Helms-Burton Act, allowing U.S. citizens to bring lawsuits in U.S. federal court against about 200 Cuban entities on a \"restricted list\" that have been subject to U.S. sanctions. The list includes entities under the control of Cuban military intelligence or security forces, but foreign companies invested in the island will be protected against such suits \u2014 at least for now.\n\n\"Doing business with Cuba is not worth trafficking in confiscated property,\" Pompeo said on Twitter. A senior State Department official told reporters that \"it's very clear through this action that we are going to hold the Cuban regime accountable for its confiscation of properties and ensure that there is justice for U.S. claimants.\"\n\nThe administration stopped short of allowing lawsuits under the law against all people or companies that do business in Cuba using property seized in the revolution. Still, officials signaled that more significant steps could take place in the future, saying they would continue reviewing the situation during the 30-day period to see whether the current measures have sufficiently deterred people from \"trafficking confiscated property.\"\n\nThe administration's plans to allow some suits was disclosed earlier Monday by NBC News and later announced by the State Department. It could play into the Trump administration's efforts to ostracize Venezuelan leader Nicolas Maduro, who is closely aligned with Cuba and whose country has been labeled by national security adviser John Bolton as part of a \"Troika of Tyranny,\" alongside Cuba and Nicaragua.\n\nEver since 1996, when the Helms-Burton Act went into effect, every U.S. president has waived a key portion of it called Title III that allows U.S. citizens, including Cuban-Americans, to sue people or companies that do business in Cuba using property seized in the revolution. Waiving that section prevented it from going into effect and averted lawsuits targeting major hotel chains, airlines and even mining companies that operate in Cuba, often in joint partnerships with government entities.\n\nThe U.S. Embassy in Havana, Cuba. Alexandre Meneghini / Reuters file\n\nAccording to research from the U.S. Cuba Trade & Economic Council, a nonprofit that promotes trade with Cuba, companies in 20 countries could face lawsuits from owners who have certified claims to confiscated property. The list includes numerous U.S. and European airlines and cruise lines, and major hotel chains such as Spain's NH Hotel Group and Melia Hotels International. There are also concerns that both the major port in Havana and the international airport are built at least partially on land owned before the revolution by Cubans who later emigrated to the U.S.\n\nExempting companies in the U.S. and allied countries will help prevent a backlash from companies like Marriott International, which has started expanding into Cuba since the two countries restored relations under President Barack Obama. It could also avert a new tension point with Europe, where countries are still bristling from the Trump administration's threats to sanction companies that maintain business in Iran.\n\nStill, groups that promote closer ties with Cuba blasted the administration's move, arguing it hurts U.S. interests and helps America's enemies.\n\n\"This is a continuation of the same embargo policy that has failed for nearly 60 years,\" said James Williams of the group Engage Cuba. \"You can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig.\"\n\nCreating a \"partial waiver\" that allows some lawsuits but not others also enters unchartered legal territory, said Angela Mariana Freyre, a former special adviser on Cuba in the White House National Security Council now at the law firm Squire Patton Boggs.\n\n\"Since Title III has been waived by every administration, both Republican and Democrat, since 1996, it has actually never been tested,\" said Freyre, who was born in Cuba. \"We don't know what a court would do or how it would interpret a limited waiver or a partial waiver of the statute.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has long sought ways to toughen the U.S. economic embargo on Communist-run Cuba and has previously rolled back some of the measures enacted by the Obama administration to expand ties between the countries.\n\nThe first indication that the administration was considering Title III as the next step to pressure Cuba came in January when the waiver was last up for renewal. Rather than renewing it for the full six months, as had been done in the past, the administration waived it for only 45 days while announcing it would conduct a \"careful review\" of policy going forward. The administration cited U.S. national interests, human rights concerns in Cuba and efforts to \"expedite a transition to democracy.\"\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., an advocate for harsher Cuba policies who has significant influence in the Trump administration, called the 45-day waiver \"a strong indication of what comes next.\" He warned on Twitter at the time that \"If you are trafficking in stolen property in #Cuba, now would be a good time to get out.\"\n\nThe 45-day waiver expires in mid-March. But Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is required to inform Congress of any intent to sign another waiver at least 15 days in advance.\n\nRechazo en\u00e9rgicamente anuncio del Dpto. de Estado #EEUU de autorizar demandas, bajo T\u00edtulo III de la Ley Helms-Burton, contra lista de compa\u00f1\u00edas cubanas sancionadas arbitrariamente por el gob. de Trump. Pr\u00f3rroga 30 d\u00edas en el resto de los casos es inaceptable amenaza vs. el mundo \u2014 Bruno Rodr\u00edguez P (@BrunoRguezP) March 4, 2019\n\nCuba's government responded to the announcement on Twitter, with Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez calling it an \"unacceptable threat vs. the world\" and saying Cuba \"strongly rejects\" the move against companies \"arbitrarily sanctioned.\"\n\nPast presidents have suspended the law out of concern over the effects it would have on the international court system, the World Trade Organization and U.S. relations with European countries, said John Kavulich of the U.S. Cuba Trade & Economic Council.\n\nEver since recognizing Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido in January as the country's legitimate leader, President Trump has been seeking further ways to pressure Maduro out of office, but is running out of options. The administration has hit Venezuela with oil sanctions and has slapped sanctions on top Venezuelan officials, but so far Maduro is refusing to leave power.\n\nVenezuela's President Nicolas Maduro attends a military exercise in in Caracas, Venezuela on February 1, 2019. Miraflores Palace / Reuters\n\nRamping up economic and diplomatic pressure on Cuba serves as one way for the Trump administration to try to deplete support for Maduro. Cuba's government is one of the only remaining countries in Latin America still backing Maduro, and in recent days the Trump administration has increasingly taken aim at Cuba for allegedly propping him up.\n\n\"For years, Cuban security and intelligence thugs, invited into Venezuela by Maduro himself and those around him, have sustained this illegitimate rule,\" Pompeo told the U.N. Security Council in January. \"Let's be crystal clear: The foreign power meddling in Venezuela today is Cuba.\"\n\nCuba has adamantly denied that claim, with Rodriguez, the foreign minister, challenging the United States to provide proof. He said the roughly 20,000 Cubans in Venezuela are all civilians.\n\n\"Our government categorically and energetically rejects this slander,\" Rodriguez told reporters in Havana. He said the crisis in Venezuela was a \"failed imperialist coup\" that had been concocted by the U.S.",

    "text": "March 19, 2019, 8:37 PM GMT By Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 President Donald Trump praised Brazil\u2019s new far-right leader Tuesday as he welcomed him to the White House, saying the man who\u2019s been described as the \u201cTrump of the Tropics\u201d has done \u201ca very outstanding job.\u201d\n\nTrump said President Jair Bolsonaro had run \u201cone of the incredible campaigns,\u201d saying he was \u201chonored\u201d it had drawn comparisons with his own 2016 victory. And he predicted the two would have a \u201cfantastic working relationship,\u201d telling reporters as he opened a joint press conference that they have \u201cmany views\u201d in common.\n\nThe two leaders were expected to discuss a range of issues during their first sit-down, including expanding trade relations, increasing U.S. private-sector investment in Brazil and resolving the ongoing political crisis in Venezuela. Both are fierce critics of Venezuela\u2019s socialist President Nicolas Maduro.\n\nAs they sat down for talks, Trump also said that he supports Brazil\u2019s effort\u2019s to join the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and is \u201cvery strongly\u201d looking at U.S. support for Brazil\u2019s effort to gain certain NATO privileges.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re very inclined to do that,\u201d Trump told reporters, describing the relationship between the two countries as better than ever.\n\n\u201cI think there was a lot of hostility with other presidents. There\u2019s zero hostility with me. And we\u2019re going to look at that very, very strongly, whether it\u2019s NATO or it\u2019s something having to do with alliance,\u201d he said.\n\nBrazil, the largest and most populous nation in Latin America, has pursued becoming a \u201cmajor non-member ally\u201d to NATO to make buying U.S. weapons easier and to lower barriers to military and other cooperation with the U.S.\n\nTrump later told reporters he intends to work to designate Brazil a \u201cmajor non-NATO ally\u201d and \u201cmaybe a NATO ally\u201d as well.\n\nDays after taking office Jan. 1, Bolsonaro, a former army captain, said Brazil would consider letting the U.S. have a military base in the country as way to counter Russian influence in the region, particularly related to Brazil\u2019s neighbor Venezuela.\n\nThat statement was roundly criticized, including by former military members of his government, and the administration backed off. Still, Bolsonaro routinely expresses his admiration for Trump and frequently says closer U.S. ties are key to Brazil\u2019s future.\n\n\u201cI admire President Donald Trump and we will certainly work toward\u201d shared interests,\u201d Bolsonaro said Tuesday, adding that just as Trump \u201cwants to have a great America,\u201d he wants to have \u201ca great Brazil.\u201d\n\nIn a sign of friendship, the two also exchanged soccer jerseys.\n\nBolsonaro has sought to underscore his pro-America stance throughout his visit.\n\n\u201cFor the first time in a while, a pro-America Brazilian president arrives in DC,\u201d he tweeted after arriving. \u201cIt\u2019s the beginning of a partnership focused on liberty and prosperity, something that all of us Brazilians have long wished for.\u201d\n\nBolsonaro continued that message in remarks to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce Monday.\n\n\u201cNowadays, you have a president who is a friend of the United States who admires this beautiful country,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Brazilian president, who arrived in the country with a half-dozen ministers, also made an unusual visit to CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, on Monday.\n\nBolsonaro\u2019s son, Eduardo, a Brazilian lawmaker accompanying him on his first bilateral overseas trip, described the CIA as \u201cone of the most respected intelligence agencies in the world\u201d in a tweet that was likely to raise eyebrows back home in Brazil, where the U.S. and its spy services have been regarded with suspicion in recent years.\n\nBolsonaro succeeded a leftist who at times had a frosty relationship with the United States. In 2013, leaks from Edward Snowden revealed that the National Security Agency had wiretapped conversations of former President Dilma Rousseff, leading to several years of tense relations between the U.S. and Brazil.\n\nHis insurgent, social media-powered campaign has been likened to Trump\u2019s 2016 effort. Like Trump, he painted himself as representing \u201cthe people\u201d standing up against \u201cthe elite,\u201d blasted unflattering stories as \u201cfake news,\u201d and mimicked Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d catch phrase, pledging to put \u201cBrazil First.\u201d\n\nIn an interview on Fox Monday, Bolsonaro said he supported Trump\u2019s hardline immigration policies and his efforts to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\u201cThe majority of potential immigrants do not have good intentions or do not intend to do the best or do good for the American people,\u201d said Bolsonaro, adding that he hoped the U.S. would uphold its current immigration policies.\n\nThe remarks were aired after the two countries signed several bilateral agreements, including one that allows the United States to use Brazil\u2019s Alcantara Aerospace Launch Base for its satellites, and Brazil announced an end to visa requirements for U.S. tourists who visit the country.\n\nBrazil is seeking U.S. help with its efforts to join the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and to expand trade. The Bolsonaro administration is seeking to reduce public-sector spending and privatize state enterprises to reduce debt and grow its economy.\n\nVenezuela is expected to be a subject of discussion. Brazil, like the U.S., has recognized the leader of the National Assembly, Juan Guaido, as Venezuela\u2019s interim president under the argument that Maduro\u2019s re-election last year was illegitimate.\n\nFOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM.",

    "text": "March 19, 2019, 2:04 PM GMT By Reuters\n\nAs the United States makes its biggest diplomatic push in Latin America in years to try to oust Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, the U.S. military is zeroing in on a byproduct of the crisis: a strengthening of Colombian rebels on both sides of Venezuela\u2019s border.\n\nU.S. Admiral Craig Faller, the head of the U.S. military\u2019s Southern Command that oversees U.S. forces in Latin America, told Reuters the United States had sharpened its focus on the rebels and increased its sharing of intelligence with Colombian officials.\n\nU.S. officials see a growing threat from both Colombia\u2019s National Liberation Army (ELN) and factions of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) that refuse to adhere to a 2016 peace agreement to end five decades of civil war.\n\nThe United States believes the rebels are taking advantage of Venezuela\u2019s crisis to expand their reach in that country and the scope of long-standing illegal activities, including drug trafficking.\n\n\u201cOur principal role working with our Colombian partners is to assist in intelligence sharing. What we know, we share,\u201d Faller said. Asked whether the intelligence sharing on the rebels had ramped up as Venezuela\u2019s crisis deepened, Faller responded: \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\n\nThe risks from the insurgents on both sides of the Colombia-Venezuela border add another layer of complexity to the crisis in Venezuela, where U.S. President Donald Trump says all options are on the table to remove Maduro from office.\n\nU.S. officials have uniformly emphasized diplomatic and economic tools to accelerate Maduro\u2019s departure, like sanctions, but Faller acknowledged the U.S. military stood ready to provide options if needed.\n\nAt the same time, he noted that no U.S. allies in the region were seeking a military solution to the crisis in Venezuela.\n\n\u201cMy job is to be ready, be on the balls of my feet, at all times. But we\u2019ve been talking to our partners and no one, no one, thinks that a military option is a good idea,\u201d Faller said.\n\nOpposition leader Juan Guaido says the May 2018 vote in which Maduro won a second term was a sham and he invoked a constitutional provision on Jan. 23 to assume the interim presidency. Most Western nations including the United States have backed Guaido as head of state.\n\nMaduro, a socialist who has denounced Guaido as a U.S. puppet seeking to foment a coup, retains the support of the armed forces and control of state functions.\n\nJeremy McDermott, a Colombia-based expert on the insurgencies and co-founder of the Insight Crime think tank, said he believed the Colombian insurgents were operating in Venezuela with at least the blessing of Maduro.\n\nThe rebels\u2019 aim is to exploit Venezuela\u2019s lawlessness for safe haven and for economic gain, he said. But he noted there could be an added benefit for Maduro.\n\n\u201cIf the Americans invade, or if Colombia promotes a military intervention, then they (Maduro\u2019s supporters) would be able to call upon an insurgent force with more than 50 years of combat experience,\u201d McDermott said.\n\nAsked whether the United States had any evidence of communications between Maduro and the guerrilla groups, Faller said: \u201cI\u2019d rather not discuss the details of the exact connections but we\u2019re watching it very closely.\u201d\n\nVenezuela\u2019s Information Ministry and ELN contacts did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nColombia\u2019s ambassador to Washington, former Vice President Francisco Santos, said ELN and FARC factions had long been present in Venezuela but had grown stronger and more integrated into the country as a result of Venezuela\u2019s crisis.\n\n\u201cThey have become the paramilitary groups of the Maduro administration,\u201d Santos told Reuters.\n\nELN EXPANSION\n\nA Cuba-inspired Marxist insurgency formed in 1964, the ELN claimed responsibility for a January car bomb attack against a police academy in Bogota that killed 22 cadets. It was an escalation by insurgents who have kidnapped Colombian security forces, attacked police stations and bombed oil pipelines.\n\nU.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, say the ELN is increasingly using Venezuelan territory to carry out narco-trafficking and illegal mining of minerals like gold and coltan.\n\nThe Venezuelan security forces were believed to be getting kickbacks from the guerrillas, they said.\n\nOne U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the U.S. collection of intelligence on the guerrilla groups had increased in recent weeks, including looking at the militants\u2019 activities on the Venezuelan side of the border with Colombia.\n\nSeveral U.S. officials said they believed senior leaders of both the ELN and the so-called FARC dissidents who do not adhere to the peace agreement were now located inside of Venezuela.\n\n\u201cTheir leadership is there,\u201d a second U.S. official said, who also declined to be named, without providing evidence.\n\nAn International Crisis Group report cited estimates that the ELN had been active in a minimum of 13 of Venezuela\u2019s 24 states, \u201cabsorbing new recruits and shifting from a guerrilla force that embraced armed resistance against Colombia\u2019s ruling elites to one with many core operations in Venezuela.\u201d\n\nOpposition lawmakers in Venezuela also regularly denounce growing ELN activities in Venezuela, but Reuters has been unable to independently verify the extent of its presence or its operations.\n\nFaller declined to discuss any specifics about the collection of U.S. intelligence or identify which insurgent leaders were in Venezuela.\n\nBut he acknowledged the trend and added that the flow of illegal narcotics \u201cfrom Colombia into Venezuela, and then from Venezuela out in the region, has risen as the misery of the Venezuelan people has risen.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s essentially a lawless region now inside Venezuela along the border and the FARC dissidents and the ELN have taken advantage of that,\u201d Faller said, adding: \u201cThey operate with impunity inside Venezuela.\u201d\n\nSantos said the big concern for Colombia was that the strengthening rebel forces would upend efforts to crack down on narcotics trafficking.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a big worry because in this situation of chaos, obviously they are going to grow. They are growing,\u201d he said.\n\nFOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM.",
