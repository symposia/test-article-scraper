    "text": "Huawei\u2019s already proven that a ban in the world\u2019s second largest smartphone market won\u2019t hamper its rapid success, but the company still won\u2019t go down in the States without a fight. Word is that the consumer electronics giant is planning to unveil a lawsuit against the U.S. government later this week.\n\nThat news comes via two anonymous sources reported in The New York Times this morning. The reported impending suit is pushback against longstanding bans in the States that have barred the company\u2019s equipment from infrastructural projects ahead of a nationwide push into 5G. It\u2019s also made the nation\u2019s carriers and retail stores wary of stocking Huawei products.\n\nThe suit is reportedly set to be filed in the Eastern District of Texas \u2014 the location of Huawei\u2019s U.S. headquarters, as well as a notorious haven for patent trolls.\n\nU.S. officials have long recommended against using Huawei devices over alleged ties to the Chinese government. On Friday, meanwhile, the Canadian DOJ allowed an extradition case against Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou to proceed after her arrest in Vancouver late last year. Those charges stem from allegations that the company circumvented sanctions on Iran.\n\nEarlier today it was announced that Meng was filing a civil suit in the country, alleging that authorities didn\u2019t advise her of her constitutional rights prior to questioning and detaining her.\n\nWe\u2019ve reached out to Huawei for comment on the suits.",

    "text": "OTTAWA (Reuters) - The lawyers for Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou are suing the Canadian government, its border agency and federal police, alleging their client was detained, searched and interrogated for three hours in violation of her constitutional rights.\n\nCanada arrested Meng in Vancouver on Dec. 1 at the request of the United States, which has brought sweeping charges against her and China\u2019s Huawei Technologies Co that portray the company as a threat to U.S. national security. Meng was charged with bank and wire fraud to violate American sanctions against Iran.\n\nIn a civil lawsuit filed in the British Columbia Supreme Court on Friday, Meng\u2019s lawyers said the manner in which officers obtained evidence and information from Meng constituted serious violations of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Meng is the daughter of Huawei\u2019s founder.\n\nIt added that Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) officers deliberately delayed the immediate execution of an arrest warrant and unlawfully subjected Meng to detention, search and interrogation to extract evidence from her before she was arrested.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police - Canada\u2019s federal police - only exercised its arrest warrant three hours after Meng\u2019s \u201cunlawful\u201d detention at the airport, the lawsuit added.\n\nThere was no immediate response from Canada\u2019s justice ministry or the RCMP. The CBSA said it did not comment on matters before the courts.\n\nMeng, who is out on bail, is due to appear in a Vancouver court at 10 a.m. PST (1800 GMT) on Wednesday, when a date will be set for her extradition hearing.

    "text": "TORONTO \u2014 An executive of Chinese tech giant Huawei is suing the Canadian government, its border agency and the national police force, saying they detained, searched and interrogated her before telling her she was under arrest.\n\nLawyers for Meng Wanzhou said Sunday they filed a notice of civil claim in the British Columbia Supreme Court. Canada arrested Meng, the daughter of Huawei\u2019s founder, at the request of the U.S. on Dec. 1 at Vancouver\u2019s airport. She is wanted on fraud charges that she misled banks about the company\u2019s business dealings in Iran.\n\nThe suit alleges that instead of immediately arresting her, authorities interrogated Meng \u201cunder the guise of a routine customs\u201d examination and used the opportunity to \u201ccompel her to provide evidence and information.\u201d The suit alleges Canada Border Service Agency agents seized her electronic devices, obtained passwords and unlawfully viewed the contents and intentionally failed to adviser her of the true reasons for her detention. The suit said only after three hours was she told she was under arrest and had right to counsel.\n\n\u201cThis case concerns a deliberate and pre-meditated effort on the part of the defendant officers to obtain evidence and information from the plaintiff in a manner which they knew constituted serious violations of the plaintiff\u2019s rights,\u201d the claim says.\n\nMeng is out on bail and living in Vancouver awaiting extradition proceedings.\n\nOn Friday, Canadian Justice Department officials gave the go-ahead for her extradition proceedings to begin. Meng is due in court Wednesday to set a date for the proceedings to start. It could be several months or even years before her case is resolved.\n\nMeng\u2019s arrest set off a diplomatic furor and severely strained Canadian relations with China. Beijing has accused Washington of a politically motivated attempt to hurt the company.\n\nChina detained former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and Canadian entrepreneur Michael Spavor on Dec. 10 in an apparent attempt to pressure Canada to release Meng.\n\nA Chinese court also sentenced a Canadian to death in a sudden retrial, overturning a 15-year prison term handed down earlier. Kovrig and Spavor haven\u2019t had access to a lawyer or to their families since being arrested.\n\nNicholas Dorion, a spokesman for the Canada Border Services Agency, said it\u2019s not a practice of the agency to comment ?on legal matters that are before the courts. A justice department spokesman referred comment to the border agency and a spokesman of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said they were unlikely to comment Sunday.\n\nGary Botting, a Vancouver extradition lawyer who is not representing Meng, said Canada\u2019s Border Services Agency tends to overstep.\n\n\u201cThey took her under custody without telling her why,\u201d Botting said. \u201cThey disguised the real reason why they detained her. Her rights were violated.\u201d\n\nBotting said they had no reason to detain her as she had travelled to Canada many times before. \u201cThey are trying to get all this information ahead of time and they know ultimately an arrest was in the works,\u201d he said.\n\nJulian Ku, senior associate dean for academic affairs at Hofstra Law, noted the civil action is separate and apart from Meng\u2019s extradition proceeding. He said the lawsuit will allow her to argue she is being unfairly treated and support her broader public relations claim that the detention is part of a U.S and Canadian political conspiracy against Huawei.",

    "description": "The surprise arrest of Huawei's chief financial officer in December quickly turned the executive, Meng Wanzhou, into a central figure in a trade war between two economic superpowers.",
    "text": "(Reuters) - The surprise arrest of Huawei\u2019s chief financial officer in December quickly turned the executive, Meng Wanzhou, into a central figure in a trade war between two economic superpowers.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A researcher works at a laboratory inside the headquarters of the Chinese telecommunications equipment and smartphone maker Huawei in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China March 6, 2019. REUTERS/Yuyang Wang\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump told Reuters he would consider intervening in her case - a potential action he alluded to again two weeks ago - if it would help close a trade deal with China.\n\nMeng\u2019s lawyer on Wednesday told a Canadian court that he has concerns the allegations against her have a political character, noting Trump\u2019s comments on the case.\n\nBut U.S. probes of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd for allegedly evading U.S. sanctions on Iran were not rooted in Trump\u2019s trade aspirations. Long before Trump initiated a bitter trade war with China, Huawei activities were under scrutiny by U.S. authorities, according to interviews with ten people familiar with the Huawei probes and documents related to the investigations seen by Reuters.\n\nThe U.S. focus on Huawei intensified after years of investigation into smaller Chinese rival ZTE Corp, and relied in part on information collected from devices of company employees traveling through airports.\n\nTwo of the sources said a critical point took place in August 2017, when deputy U.S. Attorney General Rod Rosenstein - best known for his oversight of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe of Russian interference in the U.S. election \u2013 handed a lead role to Brooklyn prosecutors to pursue possible bank fraud charges against Huawei.\n\nFifteen months later, that strategy would help land Meng in a Canadian jail.\n\nThe U.S. investigations of China\u2019s top telecom companies were spurred by reports by Reuters over six years ago, detailing possible Iran sanctions violations by both ZTE and Huawei, as well as close ties between Huawei and Skycom Tech Co Ltd - a suspected front company doing business in Iran.\n\nA spokesman for Huawei, the world\u2019s largest telecommunications equipment maker, has denied the charges in the sanctions case, and did not provide further comment to Reuters. Meng has said she is innocent of the charges. ZTE, which pleaded guilty in 2017 for illegally shipping U.S. goods to Iran, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nU.S. Justice Department spokeswoman Nicole Navas Oxman said the government pursues cases \u201cfree of any political interference and follows the evidence and rule of law in pursuing criminal charges.\u201d\n\nAIRPORT EVIDENCE GRAB\n\nOn December 1, 2018, Meng was stopped at Vancouver International Airport as she walked up the jetway after her flight, according to a lawsuit she filed on Friday accusing the Canadian government of violating her rights. Border officers examined her passport and escorted her to an area for secondary screenings.\n\nWhile there, she was instructed to surrender her two mobile phones, an iPad and a personal computer, along with their passwords, the suit alleges, and the officers viewed the devices\u2019 contents.\n\nReuters has not been able to determine what information was found on Meng\u2019s devices, but it is not the first time she and other Chinese telecom executives have turned over such property to border patrol agents.\n\nIn the years leading up to the Huawei indictment, U.S. officials had been capturing information that would influence the investigation when telecom executives passed through U.S. airports, according to a number of sources familiar with the Huawei and ZTE investigations and the Meng indictment.\n\nFor example, Meng arrived in the United States via John F. Kennedy International Airport in early 2014. The indictment says investigators found \u201csuggested talking points\u201d on one of her electronic devices, stating among other things that Huawei\u2019s relationship with Skycom was \u201cnormal business cooperation.\u201d\n\nMeng had been pulled into a secondary screening at the airport that time as well, and her electronic devices were taken, according to one person familiar with the stop. After a couple of hours, the devices were returned and she was freed to go, the person said.\n\nAnother border search, this time on September 12, 2014, of executives from rival ZTE also supported U.S. investigators long-held suspicions of how Huawei might have been doing illicit business in countries subject to U.S. sanctions, one of the sources told Reuters.\n\nZTE\u2019s CFO at the time was stopped at Boston\u2019s Logan Airport after flying in from London with an assistant, the person said.\n\nThe assistant was carrying a Lenovo laptop containing a confidential ZTE document, dated August 25, 2011 and signed by four top executives, about the need to establish front companies to supply U.S. procured items needed for projects in embargoed countries.\n\nThe airport stop provided key evidence against ZTE in its legal battle with the United States, according to U.S. officials. But it also identified a company as \u201cF7\u201d and how it used a front company to serve as its agent for contracts in sanctioned countries. F7 was Huawei, according to the individuals familiar with the ZTE and Huawei investigations.\n\nThe document was posted on the U.S. Commerce Department website in March 2016 when ZTE was placed on a list of companies that were restricted from buying parts and components from U.S. suppliers. Shortly after the public posting, the New York Times reported that the description of F7 offered by ZTE matched Huawei.\n\nA month later, the Commerce Department sent a subpoena to Huawei in the United States demanding information on the company\u2019s exporting American technology to Iran, according to a court document and one of the people familiar with the Huawei probe.\n\nFROM ZTE TO HUAWEI\n\nWith the case against ZTE wrapping up, more than a dozen people from Departments of Treasury, Commerce, Homeland Security and Justice, gathered in Washington on February 14, 2017 and talked about how they were moving forward against Huawei, according to a person familiar with matter.\n\nBrooklyn prosecutors discussed the relationship between Huawei and HSBC, a bank that was required to cooperate with U.S. prosecutors in any investigation until the end of 2017 for violating U.S. anti-money laundering and sanctions laws, the person added.\n\nIn late 2016, HSBC began to conduct an internal bank probe of Huawei. In the weeks and months following the meeting, HSBC helped authorities obtain evidence of links between Skycom and Huawei, documents reviewed by Reuters show. The probe found Meng met in 2013 with a HSBC banker. She later gave him a copy of the PowerPoint presentation, which the U.S. indictment says misrepresented Huawei\u2019s control of Skycom.\n\nHSBC told Reuters that it provided information in response to demands from the Justice Department.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in Washington, D.C., meanwhile, pursued a more traditional export control investigation against Huawei, which included the accusations of attempted illegal shipments of computers to Iran disclosed in the Reuters 2012 story.\n\nA grand jury subpoena was issued to the U.S subsidiary of the company in April 2017, the first clear sign to Huawei that the probe had turned criminal.\n\nArmed with that knowledge, the company moved U.S.-based Chinese employees who knew about its Iranian dealings out of the country and otherwise concealed and destroyed evidence, the prosecutors allege. Meng and other Huawei executives also began to avoid travel to the United States, prosecutors say.\n\nIn the late summer of 2017, according to two of the sources close to the Huawei investigation, Rosenstein chose Brooklyn as the venue to file charges and the Washington U.S. Attorney\u2019s office dropped out of the case. Brooklyn was already working with a money laundering unit at the Justice Department. The national security division also merged with the Brooklyn prosecution team.\n\nLegal experts said since most evidence of any illegal U.S. goods in Iran presumably existed outside the jurisdiction of U.S. authorities, the bank fraud route presented a potentially quicker path to indictment. They added that bank fraud charges are more likely to lead to arrest by other countries for extradition to the United States than export controls or sanctions violations, and have a longer statute of limitations.\n\nMeng and the company were charged with bank and wire fraud. The PowerPoint presentation\u2019s \u201cnumerous misrepresentations\u201d were central to the charges brought against Meng herself, the indictment shows.\n\nTwelve months after Brooklyn got the case, prosecutors secretly obtained a warrant for Meng\u2019s arrest.\n\nLess than four months later they learned she was stopping in Vancouver en route to Mexico on December 1, and asked the Canadians to detain her at the airport.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Huawei partner offered embargoed HP gear to Iran - reut.rs/2sRL7Ve\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Huawei CFO linked to firm that offered HP gear to Iran - reut.rs/2sUq8RT\n\nEXCLUSIVE: China's ZTE planned U.S. computer sale to Iran - reut.rs/2T17JlN\n\nChinese firm (ZTE) helps Iran spy on citizens - reut.rs/2TlJJJq",

    "text": "Photo: AP\n\nChinese telecom firm Huawei has recently come under intense pressure in the U.S. to prove that the company isn\u2019t spying for the Chinese government. But if a new report is accurate, Huawei is ready to push back. Hard.\n\n\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Huawei is preparing a lawsuit against the U.S. government that could be formally announced by the end of this week. The details of Huawei\u2019s lawsuit are still unclear, but the Times claims that it will be an effort to force the U.S. \u201cto more publicly make its case\u201d that Huawei\u2019s technology is somehow a threat to the privacy and security of Americans. Gizmodo has reached out to Huawei for comment on the potential lawsuit but did not immediately hear back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe U.S. and other Five Eyes nations have alleged since at least 2012 that Huawei poses a national security threat to the west, especially if it\u2019s allowed to build critical 5G infrastructure around the world. But the national security concerns that have been so far leveled by American intelligence agencies have largely been hypothetical. Any potential specifics on how the Chinese government would use Huawei to make Americans less safe have only been uttered behind closed doors.\n\nFrom the New York Times:\n\nThe lawsuit that Huawei is preparing to file in the United States is expected to challenge a section of a defense spending authorization law that was approved last year. The provision blocks executive agencies from using telecom equipment made by Huawei and another Chinese company, ZTE. According to one of the people familiar with the matter, Huawei\u2019s lawsuit is likely to argue that the provision is a \u201cbill of attainder,\u201d or a legislative act that singles out a person or group for punishment without trial. The Constitution forbids Congress from passing such bills.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTop officials from the Five Eyes countries of the U.S., UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand reportedly met in July of 2018 to discuss the alleged threat from Huawei\u2019s technologies. But, again, the charge that Huawei poses a national security threat is so far pretty vague. A lawsuit brought by Huawei would theoretically force the U.S. government to state its case publicly, and Huawei would essentially be calling the U.S. government\u2019s bluff if U.S. officials couldn\u2019t point to specifics.\n\nBut one can easily imagine a situation where the U.S. government would be hesitant to lay out specific charges against Huawei by citing national security concerns\u2014a kind of Kafkaesque nightmare all around.\n\n\n\nIn January, the U.S. Justice Department announced charges against Huawei that include fraud, obstruction of justice, and the theft of trade secrets. And Huawei\u2019s CFO, Meng Wanzhou, was arrested in Vancouver this past December at the request of the U.S. government for allegedly violating sanctions against Iran. Meng, who is notably the daughter of Huawei\u2019s founder, faces extradition to the U.S. in the very near future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Friday, Meng filed her own civil lawsuit against the Canadian government, claiming multiple violations of her rights under Canada\u2019s Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Chinese government has accused both Canada and the U.S. of staging Meng\u2019s arrest as a purely political stunt and have demanded her immediate release.\n\nHuawei has been on a charm offensive over the past couple of months, with Huawei\u2019s CEO even giving rare interviews to U.S. media. Ren Zhengfei, the billionaire founder and CEO of Huawei, even went so far as to call President Donald Trump a \u201cgreat president.\u201d Trump, who is arguably the dumbest person to ever hold elected office in America, has responded favorably to that kind of flattery in the past.\n\n\u201cNo law requires any company in China to install mandatory back doors,\u201d Ren said on January 15, according to the Wall Street Journal. \u201cI personally would never harm the interest of my customers and me and my company would not answer to such requests.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI love my country, I support the Communist Party.

Meng is wanted in the U.S. on fraud charges that she misled banks about the company's business dealings in Iran. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press via AP, File)\n\nTORONTO (AP) -- An executive of Chinese tech giant Huawei is suing the Canadian government, its border agency and the national police force, saying they detained, searched and interrogated her before telling her she was under arrest.\n\nLawyers for Meng Wanzhou said Sunday they filed a notice of civil claim in the British Columbia Supreme Court. Canada arrested Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, at the request of the U.S. on Dec. 1 at Vancouver's airport. She is wanted on fraud charges that she misled banks about the company's business dealings in Iran.\n\nThe suit alleges that instead of immediately arresting her, authorities interrogated Meng \"under the guise of a routine customs\" examination and used the opportunity to \"compel her to provide evidence and information.\" The suit alleges Canada Border Service Agency agents seized her electronic devices, obtained passwords and unlawfully viewed the contents and intentionally failed to adviser her of the true reasons for her detention. The suit said only after three hours was she told she was under arrest and had right to counsel.\n\n\"This case concerns a deliberate and pre-meditated effort on the part of the defendant officers to obtain evidence and information from the plaintiff in a manner which they knew constituted serious violations of the plaintiff's rights,\" the claim says.\n\nMeng is out on bail and living in Vancouver awaiting extradition proceedings.\n\nOn Friday, Canadian Justice Department officials gave the go-ahead for her extradition proceedings to begin. Meng is due in court Wednesday to set a date for the proceedings to start. It could be several months or even years before her case is resolved.\n\nMeng's arrest set off a diplomatic furor and severely strained Canadian relations with China. Beijing has accused Washington of a politically motivated attempt to hurt the company.\n\nChina detained former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and Canadian entrepreneur Michael Spavor on Dec. 10 in an apparent attempt to pressure Canada to release Meng.\n\nA Chinese court also sentenced a Canadian to death in a sudden retrial, overturning a 15-year prison term handed down earlier. Kovrig and Spavor haven't had access to a lawyer or to their families since being arrested.\n\nNicolas Dorion, a spokesman for the Canada Border Services Agency, said it's not a practice of the agency to comment on legal matters that are before the courts. A justice department spokesman referred comment to the border agency, and a spokesman for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said they were unlikely to comment Sunday.\n\nGary Botting, a Vancouver extradition lawyer who is not representing Meng, said Canada's Border Services Agency tends to overstep.\n\n\"They took her under custody without telling her why,\" Botting said. \"They disguised the real reason why they detained her. Her rights were violated.\"\n\nBotting said they had no reason to detain her as she had travelled to Canada many times before. \"They are trying to get all this information ahead of time and they know ultimately an arrest was in the works,\" he said.\n\nJulian Ku, senior associate dean for academic affairs at Hofstra Law, noted the civil action is separate and apart from Meng's extradition proceeding. He said the lawsuit will allow her to argue she is being unfairly treated and support her broader public relations claim that the detention is part of a U.S and Canadian political conspiracy against Huawei.\n\nLynette Ong, an associate professor of political science at the University of Toronto who focuses on China, quipped that the detained Canadians should take Beijing to court for violation of basic human rights, taking a leaf from the Meng lawsuit.\n\n\"The violation of their human rights is so much more grave than violation of her constitutional rights,\" Ong said. \"But that's not even possible for them. The fact that they were denied a lawyer in the first place means they are not entitled to any justice.\"",

    "text": "The tech industry certainly has its share of scandals, but the drama surrounding Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou certainly takes things to the next level. This past December, Wanzhou was arrested in Canada (at the behest of the United States) on charges of wire fraud and improper business dealings with Iran. Wanzhou may ultimately be extradited to the U.S. as China, not surprisingly, has vehemently denied the allegations on Wanzhou\u2019s behalf. As Huawei executives would have you believe, the charges are simply a means to hinder the company\u2019s growth.\n\nThe legal case involving Wanzhou is still playing out, but recently released court documents include a surprising revelation regarding the gear Wanzhou had in her possession when she was arrested. Originally made public by the Twitter account theBreakerNews, it turns out that Wanzhou had a penchant for Apple products.\n\nRelated stories\n\nIt's far too early and lazy to compare Apple TV+ to mature services like Netflix and Hulu\n\nA new biography explains why Apple is more successful than ever under Tim Cook\n\nHuawei just unveiled the P30 Pro, likely the best camera phone on the planet\n\n\n\n\n\nUpon her arrest, Wanzhou had a MacBook Air, an iPad Pro, and an iPhone 7 Plus in her possession. She was also carrying a Huawei Mate RS Porsche Design which was likely her primary device. Still, it has to be somewhat embarrassing for an executive of a company looking to dethrone Apple to be apprehended with a slew of Apple products.\n\nNo you might be naturally thinking: \u201cSo she had a few Apple products on her, what\u2019s the big deal?\u201d Well, if we go back just a few months, you may recall that two Huawei employees who were manning the company\u2019s Twitter account were demoted after they sent out a celebratory New Years tweet from an iPhone. The tweet was promptly deleted once word began to spread, but the higher-ups at Huawei were quite displeased and also cut the salary of the employees in question.\n\nFurther, an internal Huawei memo obtained by Reuters at the time revealed that Huawei executives believed \u201cthe incident caused damage to the Huawei brand.\u201d\n\nAll that said, Wanzho\u2019s penchant for Apple products isn\u2019t a good look.\n\nSign up for BGR's Newsletter.

The news was spotted earlier Thursday by the South China Morning Post.\n\n\"We have prepared our own operating system.

    "text": "\n\nChris Bodeen, The Associated Press\n\n\n\n\n\nBEIJING -- China's foreign ministry said Wednesday that it is blocking some imports of Canadian canola due to fears of insect infestation, in what some suggest is just the latest swipe against the Canadian government for arresting a top Chinese tech executive.\n\nAt a daily briefing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China suspended canola imports from a Canadian company \"in accordance with laws and regulations and international practice.\"\n\nLu cited \"harmful organisms\" he did not further identify as a threat, adding that China's government \"needs to protect the health and safety of its own people.\"\n\n\"I can tell you responsibly that the Chinese government's decision is definitely well-founded. Upon verification, China customs has recently detected dangerous pests in canola imported from Canada many times,\" Lu said.\n\nOne of Canada's largest grain processors, Richardson International Ltd., said Tuesday that China had revoked its permit to export canola there amid allegations of an infestation. Canada disputes that claim.\n\nMany see the measure as retaliation for Canada's arrest of Chinese tech giant Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of Huawei's founder.\n\nCanada is proceeding with an extradition hearing for Meng following her December arrest at the request of the U.S., where she is wanted on fraud charges for allegedly misleading banks about the company's dealings with Iran. Meng was set to return to British Columbia Supreme Court for a hearing Wednesday.\n\nIt wouldn't be the first time Beijing has retaliated against nations that offend it. China suspended its bilateral trade deal with Norway and restricted imports of Norwegian salmon after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Chinese political prisoner Liu Xiaobo in 2010.\n\nBritain and other countries were retaliated against over meetings with the Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, considered a dangerous separatist by Beijing.\n\nCanadian Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau said in a statement that the Canadian Food Inspection Agency conducted investigations after China issued notices of non-compliance on canola seed imports, including nine since January. She said the agency had not identified any pests or bacteria of concern.\n\nChina receives about 40 per cent of Canada's canola exports, and the revocation of Richardson's permit hurts the entire value chain of industries involved in the market, the Canola Council of Canada has said.\n\nNeil Townsend, senior market analyst at FarmLink, however, said he thinks there is a definite link to the Huawei case.\n\n\"There's no doubt China's mad at us,\" he said.\n\nCanola prices already have been hit by China's retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural exports. Further cutbacks on Chinese buying would deal a major blow to what is a lifeline for agriculture in western Canada.\n\n\"I am very concerned by what we've heard has happened to Richardson. We do not believe there's any scientific basis for this,\" Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said Tuesday in Montreal. \"We are working very, very hard with the Chinese government on this issue.\"\n\nChina has warned of serious consequences if the Huawei executive is not released. China arrested two Canadians on Dec. 10 in what was widely seen as an attempt to pressure Canada.\n\nAfter Meng's arrest, a Chinese court also sentenced a Canadian to death in a sudden retrial, overturning a 15-year prison term handed down earlier.\n\nWith files from The Associated Press",

    "description": "Chinese telecoms equipment maker Huawei Technologies sued the U.S. government on Thursday saying a law limiting its U.S. business was unconstitutional, ratcheting up its fight back against a government bent on closing it out of global markets.",
    "text": "HONG KONG/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Chinese telecoms equipment maker Huawei Technologies sued the U.S. government on Thursday, saying a law limiting its American business was unconstitutional, ratcheting up its fight back against a government bent on closing it out of global markets.\n\nHuawei said it had filed a complaint in a federal court in Texas challenging Section 889 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), signed into law by U.S. President Donald Trump in August, which bars federal agencies and their contractors from procuring its equipment and services.\n\nThe lawsuit marks the latest confrontation between China and the United States, which spent most of 2018 slapping import tariffs on billions of dollars worth of each other\u2019s goods. The year ended with the arrest of Huawei\u2019s chief financial officer in Canada at U.S. request, to the consternation of China.\n\nLong before Trump initiated the trade war, Huawei\u2019s activities were under scrutiny by U.S. authorities, according to interviews with 10 people familiar with the Huawei probes and documents related to the investigations seen by Reuters.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Congress has repeatedly failed to produce any evidence to support its restrictions on Huawei products. We are compelled to take this legal action as a proper and last resort,\u201d Huawei Rotating Chairman Guo Ping said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThis ban not only is unlawful, but also restricts Huawei from engaging in fair competition, ultimately harming U.S. consumers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe look forward to the court\u2019s verdict.\u201d\n\nWhile Huawei had very little share of the U.S. market before the bill, it is the world\u2019s biggest telecoms gear maker and is seeking to be at the forefront of a global rollout of fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks and services.\n\nIn its lawsuit, Huawei said its \u201cequipment and services are subject to advanced security procedures, and no backdoors, implants, or other intentional security vulnerabilities have been documented in any of the more than 170 countries in the world where Huawei equipment and services are used.\u201d\n\nThe privately owned firm has embarked on a public relations and legal offensive as Washington lobbies allies to abandon Huawei when building 5G networks, focusing on a 2017 Chinese law requiring companies to cooperate with national intelligence work.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Government is sparing no effort to smear the company and mislead the public,\u201d Guo said in a news briefing at Huawei\u2019s headquarters in southern China.\n\nThe U.S. State Department declined comment on the lawsuit on Thursday.\n\n\u201cMore generally,\u201d State Department spokesman Robert Palladino told reporters, \u201cthe United States advocates for secure telecom networks and supply chains that are free from suppliers subject to foreign government control or undue influence which would pose risks of unauthorized access and malicious cyber activity.\u201d\n\nU.S. Representative Mike Conaway, a Texas Republican who has sponsored anti-Huawei legislation, called the Huawei lawsuit \u201cbogus.\u201d\n\n\u201cNO PROOF\u201d\n\nThe NDAA bans the U.S. government from doing business with Huawei or compatriot peer ZTE Corp or from doing business with any company that has equipment from the two companies as a \u201csubstantial or essential component\u201d of their system.\n\nIn its lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Texas, Huawei argues that the section in question is illegal because it could sharply limit the company\u2019s ability to do business in the United States despite no proof of wrongdoing.\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges that Huawei has been denied due process and that Congress, by stripping Huawei of commercial opportunities, has violated the \u201cseparation of powers\u201d portion of the U.S. Constitution by doing the work of the courts.\n\nChinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said he had no information on whether China\u2019s government may also seek legal action against the U.S. law, but added Huawei\u2019s move is \u201ctotally reasonable and totally understandable.\u201d\n\nThe Huawei brand logo is seen above a store of the telecoms equipment maker in Beijing, China, March 7, 2019. REUTERS/Thomas Peter\n\nUPHILL BATTLE\n\nSome legal experts said Huawei\u2019s lawsuit is likely to be dismissed because U.S. courts are reluctant to second-guess national security determinations by other branches of government.\n\nThe lawsuit \u201cwill be an uphill battle because Congress has broad authority to protect us from perceived national security threats,\u201d said Franklin Turner, a government contracts lawyer at McCarter & English.\n\nIn November, a federal appeals court rejected a similar lawsuit filed by Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab, which was challenging a ban on the use of its software in U.S. government networks.\n\nThe Texas court hearing Huawei\u2019s case will not be bound by that decision, but will likely adopt its reasoning because of similarities in the two disputes, said Steven Schwinn, a professor at the John Marshall Law School in Chicago.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how (Huawei) can really escape that result,\u201d said Schwinn.\n\nHuawei\u2019s chief legal officer, Song Liuping, said the two cases were different in terms of evidence and scope, and that the Chinese company\u2019s case had \u201cfull merits.\u201d\n\nIf a judge decides Huawei has a plausible claim, the case will proceed to the discovery phase, in which internal documents are shared and U.S. government officials could be forced to provide testimony and lay out their security concerns.\n\nRETRIBUTION\n\nThe legal action compares with a more restrained response in December emphasizing \u201ctrust in justice\u201d after the arrest of Chief Financial Officer Sabrina Meng Wanzhou.\n\nA man enters a Huawei shop in Beijing, China, March 7, 2019. REUTERS/Thomas Peter\n\nHuawei founder Ren Zhengfei later said Meng\u2019s arrest was politically motivated and \u201cnot acceptable.\u201d\n\nMeng - Ren\u2019s daughter - is accused by the United States of bank and wire fraud related to breaches of trade sanctions against Iran. Canada approved extradition proceedings on March 1, but Meng has since sued Canada\u2019s government for procedural wrongs in her arrest. The next court hearing is set for May 8.\n\nThe case strained Canada\u2019s relations with China, which this week accused two arrested Canadians of stealing state secrets and blocked Canadian canola imports.\n\nMeng is under house arrest in Vancouver. It is unclear where the two Canadians are being detained in China, and at least one does not have access to legal representation, sources previously told Reuters.",

Of the assortment of other tech items on her person, Meng had but one device manufactured by her company: a Porsche Design Huawei Mate 20 RS.Word of Meng's apparent proclivity for Apple gear arrived in court filings seeking a copy of the data stored on the devices. Defense attorneys also asked the court to seal the equipment in a hearing on Friday.Justice Heather Holmes of the British Columbia Supreme Court agreed to the request, ordering the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to extract Meng's data and provide it to her lawyers, reports the National Post. Two copies of the material, along with the resealed devices, will subsequently be stored in an exhibit locker.Huawei, a fierce smartphone segment competitor that seeks to dethrone industry stalwarts Apple and Samsung as the world's premiere handset vendor, is notoriously strict with employees found using a competitor's products.In January, for example, two low level workers were penalized for using an iPhone to post a New Year's Day message to Huawei's official Twitter account. The public relations gaffe earned the employees demotions and salary cuts Meng, the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, is apparently beyond reproach.While Huawei does not abide employee use of rival products, it supposedly welcomes investigation of the technology that underpins those devices. According to reports, the Chinese firm employs \"dubious\" strategies to obtain and reverse engineer proprietary tech developed by Apple and other competitors.Meng is currently fighting extradition to the U.S., where she faces fraud charges leveled by the Department of Justice.",

The sensational arrest put the stock market into a dive and has resulted in China arresting two Canadians, presumably in retaliation.\n\nThe Canadian police might have been a bit surprised when they seized Meng\u2019s things, because despite being a high-flying Huawei executive her tech company of choice appears to be Apple.\n\nMeng had been passing through Vancouver Airport with an iPhone 7 Plus, a MacBook Air, and an iPad Pro, according to a report from Bloomberg, which had found the detail in court filings. (This appears to put Meng squarely in the camp that believes an iPad Pro cannot replace a laptop.)\n\nIn fairness, there was one Huawei device among her possessions: the latest P20 mobile phone with the Porsche design.\n\nHuawei has been particularly strict with staff who use non-Huawei products, most recently demoting two staff responsible for a Happy New Year tweet that was sent from an iPhone. It\u2019s unlikely the founder\u2019s daughter will face similar punishment, as she has quite a bit on her plate already.\n\nHuawei has seen growing market share in China as Apple stumbles, with some predicting it could get worse if Apple faces retaliation over Meng\u2019s arrest. Even without that factor, China is proving to be a highly competitive market that may require a unique approach.\n\nAs the trade war between the US and China continues, there are already rumblings of companies in China strongly encouraging their staff to stop using iPhones. The headwinds for Apple are only going to get worse, at least least until the two sides are able to hammer out an agreement that takes some of the pressure off US companies.\n\nSubscribe to 9to5Mac on YouTube for more Apple news:",

The company has strongly denied the allegation. In the weeks that followed, other major canola companies in Canada reported that contracts with the Far Eastern country were drying up. The industry is worth $4 billion annually.\n\nAccording to Ong, Norway and Australia have both seen trade with China affected by diplomatic rifts.\n\nIn 2010, China placed restrictions on imports of Norwegian salmon, after Norway awarded the Nobel Peace Prize to Chinese political prisoner Liu Xiaobo. Further restrictions followed in 2015 over Beijing's claim that the fish carried a virus, before the ban was lifted in July last year.\n\n\"They kept talking to each other and eventually I think China decided to put it behind them,\" Ong said.\n\nEarlier this year, Australian coal was refused at a major Chinese port, in what commentators saw as retaliation for Canberra banning the tech giant Huawei from its 5G network.\n\nOng argued that \"an alliance would actually help us to rally support, and to increase our leverage and our weight in terms of negotiations with China.\"\n\n\"A single country alone would never be able to stand up to China because of its sheer size,\" she said.\n\nThe canola industry is worth $4 billion annually to Canada and Canadian farmers.

    "description": "'Get back on the job': Notley calls for Trudeau to act after China ban hits Alberta canola producers Edmonton Journal Premier Rachel Notley is demanding Prime Minister Justin Trudeau take action after China blocked some Canadian canola imports, a move which c\u2026",
    "text": "Premier Rachel Notley is demanding Prime Minister Justin Trudeau take action after China blocked some Canadian canola imports, a move which could cost Albertans \u201chundreds of millions\u201d and \u201c3,000 jobs.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s Foreign Ministry said Wednesday that it is blocking some imports of Canadian canola due to fears of insect infestation. Richardson International Ltd., one of Canada\u2019s largest grain producers, said Tuesday that the country had revoked its permit to export canola there amid infestation allegations. Canada disputes that claim.\n\nNotley, in a Wednesday statement, came out swinging, noting that Richardson International Ltd. exports 30 per cent of Alberta\u2019s canola.\n\n\u201cToday, we learned that the Chinese government is barring a huge chunk of our canola shipments from entering their country. This is wrong and it\u2019s unfair,\u201d said Notley.\n\n\u201cSeventy per cent of agri-food exports to China from Alberta are canola-related products. And canola farming contributes billions to the Canadian economy.\n\n\u201cSo, today, I\u2019m calling on the prime minister to get back on the job and fight for our canola farmers and the jobs they support. We are calling on Ottawa to stop its navel-gazing about its internal controversies and fight back.\u201d\n\nThe premier went on to demand Ottawa \u201cbe in Canada\u2019s corner.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlberta farmers and Alberta workers stand to lose hundreds of millions of dollars and up to 3,000 jobs if this is not resolved,\u201d said Notley.\n\n\u201cWe need certainty.\u201d\n\nFederal Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau in a Wednesday statement called the issue a top priority for the Canadian government and said she is in talks with provincial partners.\n\n\u201cOur government understands the importance of the canola industry to the Canadian economy,\u201d said Bibeau. \u201cWe are taking a science-based approach to finding a solution.\u201d\n\nSome observers are speculating that the block may be the latest swipe against the Canadian government for arresting a top Chinese tech executive.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a huge drop-off in canola prices, especially over the past couple of weeks,\u201d said Bruce Burnett, director of weather and markets at Glacier FarmMedia.\n\nHe called it a major drop for the commodity, which likely wouldn\u2019t have happened without the backdrop of a deteriorating relationship between China and Canada. The fallout follows the arrest of Chinese tech giant Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver on Dec. 1, 2018.\n\nOn Dec. 3, the May futures contract, which Burnett noted was not the most actively traded at the time, closed at $496 per tonne. Wednesday afternoon, it was trading at about $456 \u2014 a roughly eight per cent drop. It was expected that exports to China would remain strong through most of the crop year, he said, with fairly solid prices.\n\nCanada exported about $3.6 billion worth of canola seed, oil and meal to China in 2017, according to the Canola Council of Canada\u2019s most recent figures.\n\nNow that China has blocked Richardson\u2019s shipments, the question becomes: what will happen to other companies, Burnett said.\n\nIt\u2019s possible others could have their permits revoked. But, unlike Winnipeg-based Richardson, other players in Canada tend to be part of large multinational organizations. Regina-based Viterra Inc., for example, is part of Switzerland-based Glencore International.\n\nWhile it\u2019s hard to read the minds of what the Chinese government is thinking, it\u2019s likely these companies will be very cautious, he said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s large amounts of money involved here that the companies will be very wary of shipping cargoes that could be rejected or that type of thing.\u201d\n\nSherwood Park\u2019s Ward Toma, general manager of Alberta Canola Producers Commission, said his group has been working with the Canola Council of Canada, which has been working with federal government officials in contact with the Chinese government.\n\n\u201cRight now we\u2019re just hoping for a fast resolution, there\u2019s been very little info of what is going on and we\u2019re waiting to hear more,\u201d Toma said Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\u201cThe longer this drags out, the better the chance that canola prices that farmers get paid will decline. That will impact sales and everyone along the canola chain will be impacted by it.\u201d\n\nAl Mussel, research lead and founder of Agri-Food Economic Systems Inc., said it\u2019s a convenient time for China to decrease the amount of canola it imports because the country is grappling with an outbreak of African Swine Fever, a fatal disease that targets pigs.\n\nThat means China doesn\u2019t need as much canola to feed its pig herd, said Mussell, adding that some estimate the country will drop its pork production by up to 20 per cent this year.\n\n\u2014 With files from The Canadian Press and The Associated Press",

In it, the federal government barred itself from using products made by Huawei as well as another Chinese hardware maker, ZTE.\n\nLook for Huawei to argue that such a provision is a \u201cbill of attainder,\u201d something the Constitution doesn\u2019t allow Congress to pass. A bill of attainder is any legislation that singles out a person or entity for a punitive measure outside of a trial.\n\nThat defense legislation is one example among many that we and others have been reporting about for months, as tension between the US and Huawei keeps ratcheting up. Complicating things is the fact that this matter is also a kind of proxy fight between the US and China, where it\u2019s assumed Huawei has close ties to the government there \u2014 the government also being a central target of the Trump administration over trade issues.\n\nWord of Huawei apparently poised to sue the US government comes as the company\u2019s embattled CFO Meng Wanzhou has also actually gone ahead and filed a lawsuit in Canada against the government there, as well as its border agency and national police. Her suit is focused on what she says was a denial of her civil rights when the Canadians arrested her in December at the behest of the US. She\u2019ll be back in court on Wednesday as part of an extradition hearing.\n\nWhile all this has gone on, Huawei has for weeks executed a kind of PR charm offensive, offering interviews to select journalists, trying to make its case at MWC and taking out full-page ads in major US newspapers. To no avail, it seems.\n\nIn the weeks after her arrest, US law enforcement officials in January unveiled a series of criminal charges against Huawei that include allegations of bank fraud and the alleged theft of US company trade secrets.\n\nIt should be noted that, according to the NYT, Huawei\u2019s plans related to a lawsuit aren\u2019t necessarily set in stone. The company may decide not to go through with a lawsuit against the US, so it will be interesting to see if this is an attempt to win some degree of leverage or if the company indeed decides to take this ongoing dispute to yet another level.",

    "description": "The surprise arrest of Huawei's chief financial officer in December quickly turned the executive, Meng Wanzhou, into a central figure in a trade war between two economic superpowers.",
    "text": "(Reuters) - The surprise arrest of Huawei\u2019s chief financial officer in December quickly turned the executive, Meng Wanzhou, into a central figure in a trade war between two economic superpowers.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A researcher works at a laboratory inside the headquarters of the Chinese telecommunications equipment and smartphone maker Huawei in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China March 6, 2019. REUTERS/Yuyang Wang\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump told Reuters he would consider intervening in her case - a potential action he alluded to again two weeks ago - if it would help close a trade deal with China.\n\nMeng\u2019s lawyer on Wednesday told a Canadian court that he has concerns the allegations against her have a political character, noting Trump\u2019s comments on the case.\n\nBut U.S. probes of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd for allegedly evading U.S. sanctions on Iran were not rooted in Trump\u2019s trade aspirations. Long before Trump initiated a bitter trade war with China, Huawei activities were under scrutiny by U.S. authorities, according to interviews with ten people familiar with the Huawei probes and documents related to the investigations seen by Reuters.\n\nThe U.S. focus on Huawei intensified after years of investigation into smaller Chinese rival ZTE Corp, and relied in part on information collected from devices of company employees traveling through airports.\n\nTwo of the sources said a critical point took place in August 2017, when deputy U.S. Attorney General Rod Rosenstein - best known for his oversight of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe of Russian interference in the U.S. election \u2013 handed a lead role to Brooklyn prosecutors to pursue possible bank fraud charges against Huawei.\n\nFifteen months later, that strategy would help land Meng in a Canadian jail.\n\nThe U.S. investigations of China\u2019s top telecom companies were spurred by reports by Reuters over six years ago, detailing possible Iran sanctions violations by both ZTE and Huawei, as well as close ties between Huawei and Skycom Tech Co Ltd - a suspected front company doing business in Iran.\n\nA spokesman for Huawei, the world\u2019s largest telecommunications equipment maker, has denied the charges in the sanctions case, and did not provide further comment to Reuters. Meng has said she is innocent of the charges. ZTE, which pleaded guilty in 2017 for illegally shipping U.S. goods to Iran, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nU.S. Justice Department spokeswoman Nicole Navas Oxman said the government pursues cases \u201cfree of any political interference and follows the evidence and rule of law in pursuing criminal charges.\u201d\n\nAIRPORT EVIDENCE GRAB\n\nOn December 1, 2018, Meng was stopped at Vancouver International Airport as she walked up the jetway after her flight, according to a lawsuit she filed on Friday accusing the Canadian government of violating her rights. Border officers examined her passport and escorted her to an area for secondary screenings.\n\nWhile there, she was instructed to surrender her two mobile phones, an iPad and a personal computer, along with their passwords, the suit alleges, and the officers viewed the devices\u2019 contents.\n\nReuters has not been able to determine what information was found on Meng\u2019s devices, but it is not the first time she and other Chinese telecom executives have turned over such property to border patrol agents.\n\nIn the years leading up to the Huawei indictment, U.S. officials had been capturing information that would influence the investigation when telecom executives passed through U.S. airports, according to a number of sources familiar with the Huawei and ZTE investigations and the Meng indictment.\n\nFor example, Meng arrived in the United States via John F. Kennedy International Airport in early 2014. The indictment says investigators found \u201csuggested talking points\u201d on one of her electronic devices, stating among other things that Huawei\u2019s relationship with Skycom was \u201cnormal business cooperation.\u201d\n\nMeng had been pulled into a secondary screening at the airport that time as well, and her electronic devices were taken, according to one person familiar with the stop. After a couple of hours, the devices were returned and she was freed to go, the person said.\n\nAnother border search, this time on September 12, 2014, of executives from rival ZTE also supported U.S. investigators long-held suspicions of how Huawei might have been doing illicit business in countries subject to U.S. sanctions, one of the sources told Reuters.\n\nZTE\u2019s CFO at the time was stopped at Boston\u2019s Logan Airport after flying in from London with an assistant, the person said.\n\nThe assistant was carrying a Lenovo laptop containing a confidential ZTE document, dated August 25, 2011 and signed by four top executives, about the need to establish front companies to supply U.S. procured items needed for projects in embargoed countries.\n\nThe airport stop provided key evidence against ZTE in its legal battle with the United States, according to U.S. officials. But it also identified a company as \u201cF7\u201d and how it used a front company to serve as its agent for contracts in sanctioned countries. F7 was Huawei, according to the individuals familiar with the ZTE and Huawei investigations.\n\nThe document was posted on the U.S. Commerce Department website in March 2016 when ZTE was placed on a list of companies that were restricted from buying parts and components from U.S. suppliers. Shortly after the public posting, the New York Times reported that the description of F7 offered by ZTE matched Huawei.\n\nA month later, the Commerce Department sent a subpoena to Huawei in the United States demanding information on the company\u2019s exporting American technology to Iran, according to a court document and one of the people familiar with the Huawei probe.\n\nFROM ZTE TO HUAWEI\n\nWith the case against ZTE wrapping up, more than a dozen people from Departments of Treasury, Commerce, Homeland Security and Justice, gathered in Washington on February 14, 2017 and talked about how they were moving forward against Huawei, according to a person familiar with matter.\n\nBrooklyn prosecutors discussed the relationship between Huawei and HSBC, a bank that was required to cooperate with U.S. prosecutors in any investigation until the end of 2017 for violating U.S. anti-money laundering and sanctions laws, the person added.\n\nIn late 2016, HSBC began to conduct an internal bank probe of Huawei. In the weeks and months following the meeting, HSBC helped authorities obtain evidence of links between Skycom and Huawei, documents reviewed by Reuters show. The probe found Meng met in 2013 with a HSBC banker. She later gave him a copy of the PowerPoint presentation, which the U.S. indictment says misrepresented Huawei\u2019s control of Skycom.\n\nHSBC told Reuters that it provided information in response to demands from the Justice Department.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in Washington, D.C., meanwhile, pursued a more traditional export control investigation against Huawei, which included the accusations of attempted illegal shipments of computers to Iran disclosed in the Reuters 2012 story.\n\nA grand jury subpoena was issued to the U.S subsidiary of the company in April 2017, the first clear sign to Huawei that the probe had turned criminal.\n\nArmed with that knowledge, the company moved U.S.-based Chinese employees who knew about its Iranian dealings out of the country and otherwise concealed and destroyed evidence, the prosecutors allege. Meng and other Huawei executives also began to avoid travel to the United States, prosecutors say.\n\nIn the late summer of 2017, according to two of the sources close to the Huawei investigation, Rosenstein chose Brooklyn as the venue to file charges and the Washington U.S. Attorney\u2019s office dropped out of the case. Brooklyn was already working with a money laundering unit at the Justice Department. The national security division also merged with the Brooklyn prosecution team.\n\nLegal experts said since most evidence of any illegal U.S. goods in Iran presumably existed outside the jurisdiction of U.S. authorities, the bank fraud route presented a potentially quicker path to indictment. They added that bank fraud charges are more likely to lead to arrest by other countries for extradition to the United States than export controls or sanctions violations, and have a longer statute of limitations.\n\nMeng and the company were charged with bank and wire fraud. The PowerPoint presentation\u2019s \u201cnumerous misrepresentations\u201d were central to the charges brought against Meng herself, the indictment shows.\n\nTwelve months after Brooklyn got the case, prosecutors secretly obtained a warrant for Meng\u2019s arrest.\n\nLess than four months later they learned she was stopping in Vancouver en route to Mexico on December 1, and asked the Canadians to detain her at the airport.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Huawei partner offered embargoed HP gear to Iran - reut.rs/2sRL7Ve\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Huawei CFO linked to firm that offered HP gear to Iran - reut.rs/2sUq8RT\n\nEXCLUSIVE: China's ZTE planned U.S. computer sale to Iran - reut.rs/2T17JlN\n\nChinese firm (ZTE) helps Iran spy on citizens - reut.rs/2TlJJJq",

    "text": "In brief: The battle between the US government and Huawei is showing no signs of abating. But should the situation get worse, the Chinese tech giant is prepared to use its own proprietary operating systems in its many mobile products.\n\nThe US has long accused Huawei of spying at the behest of the Chinese government, but tension between the two has reached new highs since the start of 2018, culminating in the recent arrest of CFO Meng Wanzhou\u2014the daughter of company founder Ren Zhengfei.\n\nA next possible step by the US could be banning American companies from doing business with Huawei. The same punishment was handed out to ZTE last year over sanctions violations. In the few months before the trade ban was lifted, the company was affected so badly that it ceased major operating activities.\n\nShould Huawei face the same ban, it will at least be more prepared. The firm has been working on an operating system that could replace Android since 2012 when the US opened an investigation into both ZTE and itself, according to the South China Morning Post.

A third Canadian man has also been sentenced to death on drug charges in China since Meng\u2019s arrest.\n\nThe Canadian legal notice filed by Meng\u2019s lawyers alleges that the police officer and several border guards detained, searched and interrogated her under the guise of a routine customs or immigration case, and used \u201cthat opportunity to unlawfully compel her to provide evidence and information.\u201d It alleges they did so without immediately arresting her under the warrant to avoid affording Meng her constitutional rights.\n\nInstead, according to the complaint, the officers detained the Huawei CFO on the jetway Dec. 1 as she was getting off a flight, took away two phones, an iPad and a computer, then got her to surrender the passwords to those devices. She was formally arrested only about three hours after her initial detention, the claim says.\n\nThe claim was filed the same day Canada\u2019s government agreed to proceed to an extradition hearing at the request of the U.S., which alleges Meng lied to banks to trick them into processing transactions for Huawei that potentially violated Iran trade sanctions. The complaint comes as China\u2019s largest tech company is increasingly playing offense to counter accusations it aids Beijing in espionage -- something it\u2019s always denied. In recent weeks, senior executives have taken shots at America\u2019s own surveillance efforts, invited foreign media to speak with its reclusive founder, and even tweeted directly at Donald Trump.\n\nDemands Release\n\nChina has accused Canada of abetting \u201ca political persecution\u201d against Huawei and has demanded the release of Meng, daughter of billionaire company founder Ren Zhengfei. History shows that if Canada follows the letter of its law, Meng will likely eventually be extradited. Meanwhile, Trump has muddied the legal waters with conflicting statements on whether he might try to intervene in what\u2019s supposed to be an independent law enforcement operation in order to boost a China trade deal.\n\nCanada\u2019s justice department referred requests to the border services agency, which declined to comment Sunday. On March 6, Meng is scheduled to appear in a Vancouver court, which will likely set the date for her first hearing in the extradition case.\n\nPhone Devices\n\nMeng was arrested in Vancouver after getting off a Cathay Pacific flight from Hong Kong, while on her way to Mexico. The claim alleges the Chinese telecom executive was not informed promptly of the reasons for her detention, nor given an opportunity to contact a lawyer.\n\nThe officials \u201cunlawfully opened and viewed the contents of the seized devices in violation of the plaintiff\u2019s right to privacy\u201d and also \u201cperformed a thorough, invasive and focused search of all of the plaintiff\u2019s luggage,\u201d the claim alleges. It says that officials interrogated her over two sessions.\n\nThe police officer \u201cintentionally delayed the arrest for the purpose of allowing the unlawful\u201d detention in Vancouver under the false pretense of a routine border check, it alleges.\n\nThe claim states that Meng\u2019s rights under Canada\u2019s Charter of Rights and Freedoms were violated. Meng, who remains under house arrest in Vancouver, suffered \u201cmental distress, anxiety and loss of liberty,\u201d it says. The claim seeks declarations that her Charter rights were infringed, various damages and costs, all unspecified.\n\n(Updates with details of detained Canadians in third paragraph.)\n\n--With assistance from Esteban Duarte.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Natalie Obiko Pearson in Vancouver at npearson7@bloomberg.net;Josh Wingrove in Ottawa at jwingrove4@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: David Scanlan at dscanlan@bloomberg.net\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.",

    "text": "It's bad enough Huawei Chief Financial Official Wanzhou Meng, who was arrested last December in Vancouver on charges ranging from fraud to money laundering, faces decades of jail time.\n\nBut now, a report from Bloomberg has revealed Meng might be a big fan of Apple products.\n\nAccording to the report, a court filing has revealed Meng had her iPhone 7 Plus, iPad Pro, and MacBook Air seized by Canadian police at the time of her arrest. Meng also had a Huawei Mate 20 RS Porsche Edition \u2014 the only Huawei product on her \u2014 taken as well with the Apple products.\n\nMeng's lawyers are reportedly requesting a copy of the data stored on the seized devices, and for them to be sealed.\n\nThe revelation is somewhat of a blunder for Meng, who is CFO of Chinese tech giant Huawei, which makes smartphones, tablets, and laptops \u2014 all very good ones \u2014 that compete directly with Apple's.\n\nNaturally, everyone's wondering why she's using Apple products if Huawei's own devices are supposed to be better, and some have already taken to Twitter with jabs at Huawei's security:\n\nWell of course, didn\u2019t need the Party spying on everything she was doing ;-) \u2014 Robert Petersen (@Sonikku_a2) March 22, 2019\n\nBecause security is important when you have secrets. \u2014 \ud835\udd4a\ud835\udd65\ud835\udd56\ud835\udd67\ud835\udd56 \ud835\udd3d\ud835\udd56\ud835\udd5a\ud835\udd5f\ud835\udd64\ud835\udd65\ud835\udd56\ud835\udd5a\ud835\udd5f\ud83d\udd96\u2122 (@saf) March 22, 2019\n\nIt may also be the case she was using Apple products to, ahem, study them. After all, you can't design products in a vacuum. But that seems unlikely \u2014 an iPhone 7 Plus is far from a cutting-edge phone in 2019 and neither is a MacBook Air (although, we have no idea which generation she had).\n\nMeng getting caught with Apple products is just the latest in a string of embarrassing moments for Huawei.\n\nPreviously, the company demoted and docked pay from employees after they were caught tweeting a New Year's message on the company's Twitter account ... from an iPhone. Huawei's corporate senior vice president and director of the board, Chen Lifang, said \"the incident caused damage to the Huawei brand.\"\n\nLast year, Huawei was caught passing off photos taken with a DSLR as images from its P9 smartphone camera.\n\nWhether Meng really is a big fan of Apple products is something we may never know, but it's still crazy to see a Huawei exec caught with so many of a competitor's products. Maybe next time, she should keep a MateBook X Pro in her bag.",

Meng was charged with bank and wire fraud to violate American sanctions against Iran.\n\nIn a civil lawsuit filed in the British Columbia Supreme Court on Friday, Meng\u2019s lawyers said the manner in which officers obtained evidence and information from Meng constituted serious violations of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Meng is the daughter of Huawei\u2019s founder.\n\nIt added that Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) officers deliberately delayed the immediate execution of an arrest warrant and unlawfully subjected Meng to detention, search and interrogation to extract evidence from her before she was arrested.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police - Canada\u2019s federal police - only exercised its arrest warrant three hours after Meng\u2019s \u201cunlawful\u201d detention at the airport, the lawsuit added.\n\nThere was no immediate response from Canada\u2019s justice ministry or the RCMP. The CBSA said it did not comment on matters before the courts.\n\nMeng, who is out on bail, is due to appear in a Vancouver court at 10 am PST (1800 GMT) on Wednesday, when a date will be set for her extradition hearing. The Canadian government approved her extradition proceedings on Friday.\n\nChina, whose relations with Canada have deteriorated over the affair, denounced Canada\u2019s decision on Friday and repeated previous demands for Meng\u2019s release.\n\nThe lawsuit further alleged that Meng was directed to surrender all her electronic devices, computers and passwords and that CBSA officers then unlawfully opened and viewed the contents of the seized devices in violation of her right to privacy.\n\nCBSA officers also searched Meng\u2019s luggage in violation of the right to privacy, the lawsuit said. \u201cThe CBSA Officers knew or were recklessly indifferent to the fact that they had no authority to conduct such a search, which search was performed under the false pretence of a routine customs or immigration-related examination,\u201d according to the lawsuit.\n\nTech2 is now on WhatsApp. For all the buzz on the latest tech and science, sign up for our WhatsApp services.

Meng is wanted in the U.S. on fraud charges that she misled banks about the company's business dealings in Iran. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press via AP, File)\n\nTORONTO (AP) -- An executive of Chinese tech giant Huawei is suing the Canadian government, its border agency and the national police force, saying they detained, searched and interrogated her before telling her she was under arrest.\n\nLawyers for Meng Wanzhou said Sunday they filed a notice of civil claim in the British Columbia Supreme Court. Canada arrested Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, at the request of the U.S. on Dec. 1 at Vancouver's airport. She is wanted on fraud charges that she misled banks about the company's business dealings in Iran.\n\nThe suit alleges that instead of immediately arresting her, authorities interrogated Meng \"under the guise of a routine customs\" examination and used the opportunity to \"compel her to provide evidence and information.\" The suit alleges Canada Border Service Agency agents seized her electronic devices, obtained passwords and unlawfully viewed the contents and intentionally failed to adviser her of the true reasons for her detention. The suit said only after three hours was she told she was under arrest and had right to counsel.\n\n\"This case concerns a deliberate and pre-meditated effort on the part of the defendant officers to obtain evidence and information from the plaintiff in a manner which they knew constituted serious violations of the plaintiff's rights,\" the claim says.\n\nMeng is out on bail and living in Vancouver awaiting extradition proceedings.\n\nOn Friday, Canadian Justice Department officials gave the go-ahead for her extradition proceedings to begin. Meng is due in court Wednesday to set a date for the proceedings to start. It could be several months or even years before her case is resolved.\n\nMeng's arrest set off a diplomatic furor and severely strained Canadian relations with China. Beijing has accused Washington of a politically motivated attempt to hurt the company.\n\nChina detained former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and Canadian entrepreneur Michael Spavor on Dec. 10 in an apparent attempt to pressure Canada to release Meng.\n\nA Chinese court also sentenced a Canadian to death in a sudden retrial, overturning a 15-year prison term handed down earlier. Kovrig and Spavor haven't had access to a lawyer or to their families since being arrested.\n\nNicolas Dorion, a spokesman for the Canada Border Services Agency, said it's not a practice of the agency to comment on legal matters that are before the courts. A justice department spokesman referred comment to the border agency, and a spokesman for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said they were unlikely to comment Sunday.\n\nGary Botting, a Vancouver extradition lawyer who is not representing Meng, said Canada's Border Services Agency tends to overstep.\n\n\"They took her under custody without telling her why,\" Botting said. \"They disguised the real reason why they detained her. Her rights were violated.\"\n\nBotting said they had no reason to detain her as she had travelled to Canada many times before. \"They are trying to get all this information ahead of time and they know ultimately an arrest was in the works,\" he said.\n\nJulian Ku, senior associate dean for academic affairs at Hofstra Law, noted the civil action is separate and apart from Meng's extradition proceeding. He said the lawsuit will allow her to argue she is being unfairly treated and support her broader public relations claim that the detention is part of a U.S and Canadian political conspiracy against Huawei.\n\nLynette Ong, an associate professor of political science at the University of Toronto who focuses on China, quipped that the detained Canadians should take Beijing to court for violation of basic human rights, taking a leaf from the Meng lawsuit.\n\n\"The violation of their human rights is so much more grave than violation of her constitutional rights,\" Ong said. \"But that's not even possible for them. The fact that they were denied a lawyer in the first place means they are not entitled to any justice.\"",

That complaint would come just days after finance chief Meng Wanzhou sued Canada\u2019s government for allegedly trampling her constitutional rights -- an effort to discredit the case against her as she awaits potential extradition to the U.S. for bank fraud.\n\nThe long-secretive Huawei began to open up this year with founder Ren Zhengfei giving interviews to foreign media and personally denying accusations his company aids Beijing in espionage. But the legal effort signals a more aggressive assault on its American accusers, who have been trying to persuade other countries to ban Huawei gear from communications networks.\n\nHuawei\u2019s lawsuit against the U.S. is aimed at a law that blocks certain government agencies from using equipment from Huawei and its domestic rival ZTE Corp., the people said. Huawei is likely to argue that it\u2019s unconstitutional to single out a person or a group for a penalty without trial, they said. Huawei declined to comment on the lawsuit, which was first reported by the New York Times.\n\nMeng\u2019s complaint is more personal. In a civil suit filed Friday, she claims officers failed to immediately arrest her on Dec. 1 in Vancouver on a U.S. extradition request and instead first detained her under the guise of a routine custom check to \u201cunlawfully compel her to provide evidence and information.\u201d The suit, filed in the Supreme Court of British Columbia, is against the Canadian Border Services Agency, a Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer and the Canadian government.\n\nHer action is \u201cprobably an effort to raise the stakes for the Canadian government,\u201d Craig Forcese, a law professor at the University of Ottawa with expertise in international and constitutional law, said by email. \u201cOne might call it a form of \u2018lawfare.\u2019\u201d\n\nCanada\u2019s Justice Minister David Lametti will ultimately be the one to sign off on any extradition -- Meng\u2019s allegations about her arrest could potentially play into that final decision.\n\nAccording to the complaint, the officers detained Meng on the jetway as she was getting off a flight, took away two phones, an iPad and a computer, then got her to surrender the passwords to those devices. She was formally arrested only about three hours after her initial detention, the claim says.\n\nHuawei is increasingly in the crosshairs of the U.S. government and its allies, just as it\u2019s pushing for leadership in supplying fifth-generation wireless technology. Countries are preparing to spend billions on the potentially revolutionary equipment aimed at enabling everything from smart highways to self-driving cars.\n\nHuawei is bolstering its own finances with a battle ahead. The company raised 14 billion yuan ($2.1 billion) through a syndicated loan, according to people familiar with the matter. Bank of China Ltd., China Construction Bank Corp., China Development Bank, China Merchants Bank Co. and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd. were lenders on the five-year facility, said the people who aren\u2019t authorized to speak publicly and asked not to be identified\n\nThe world\u2019s top provider of networking gear faces the prospect of being shut out of pivotal infrastructure markets, as it faces criminal charges in the U.S. and an American effort to convince allies not to use its equipment. The clash has complicated negotiations between Washington and Beijing as they try to hammer out a trade deal.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear how effective Huawei\u2019s lawsuits will be. The Justice Department has sued Huawei for alleged theft of trade secrets, separate from its case against Meng. The U.S. is seeking Meng\u2019s handover to face fraud charges, alleging she lied to banks to trick them into processing transactions for Huawei that potentially violated Iran trade sanctions. The allegations date back years -- a main pillar of the U.S. case is a July 2013 PowerPoint presentation that Meng gave to a HSBC Holdings Plc executive.\n\nStory continues",

    "description": "This week, Meng Wanzhou, the CFO of Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei, filed a lawsuit in Canada, claiming her constitutional rights were violated during her arrest, while the company itself intends to file a lawsuit against the US administration over i\u2026",
    "text": "This week, Meng Wanzhou, the CFO of Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei, filed a lawsuit in Canada, claiming her constitutional rights were violated during her arrest, while the company itself intends to file a lawsuit against the US administration over its law banning US federal agencies from purchasing Huawei products.\n\nJude Woodward, the author of the new book \"The US vs China: Asia's new Cold War?\" told Radio Sputnik's Loud & Clear Wednesday that Huawei's reported plans to sue the US government over its ban on Huawei products is valid, given the lack of evidence provided by the US government over its claims that the Chinese company spies on US technology.\n\n\u200bAccording to unidentified sources who recently spoke to the New York Times and the Financial Times, Huawei will claim that the US' John S. McCain National Defense Authorization Act, passed in August 2018, which bans government agencies from using technologies from Huawei and ZTE, Huawei's smaller Chinese rival, violates the US Constitution by singling out the technology firms without trial.\n\nThe US government has repeatedly asserted that Huawei's products are being used by Chinese intelligence services for spying and stealing American intellectual property.\n\n\"I think the lawsuit makes a very valid point, which is that these [US] executive orders on security were imposed without Huawei being given any evidence on which this is based. So, essentially it was trial without evidence,\" Woodward told host Walter Smolarek.\n\nAnd Woodward doesn't give much credence to the argument that Huawei devices are actually Trojan Horses to allow the Chinese government to spy on rivals.\n\n\"Huawei\u2026 doesn't do a lot of publicity work, it just puts its products out there. It has made very clear, public, unusual statements saying it does not not give information to the Chinese government, so that rather lends credence, I would say, to the argument that [spying claims are] not true, because I don't think they would make such clear and unambiguous statements if they thought that evidence was about to be turned up,\" she said.\n\n\u00a9 AP Photo / Manu Fernandez Huawei Rises Under Political Pressure From the US at the MWC in Barcelona\n\nLast year, Australia, Japan, New Zealand and the United States banned the Chinese telecommunications giant from participating in government contracts. In December 2018, Meng was arrested in the Canadian city of Vancouver for reportedly failing to comply with US sanctions against Iran.\n\nHer arrest was criticised by Beijing, which has urged Canadian authorities to release the Chinese national.\n\nHuawei might have found itself in American crosshairs over simple technological and economic rivalry, the journalist said.\n\n\"If it's [the US accusations against Huawei] not true, and let's for the moment assume that it's not true, then it's clear that the reason that has been widely speculated in the media, which is that the US administration does not want a Chinese company to become a leading company on the 5G technology. So, rather than the whole world being dependent on the most advanced US technology, in some areas at least, the world will become dependent on Chinese technologies,\" Woodward explained.\n\n\"The US accuses China of stealing technology but also of unfairly using important state investment to develop R&D and to aid particular companies. This is, I find, ironic, because if we believe what the [US] neoliberals say, then actually it should be to the detriment of China that it interferes with the market this way.\"\n\n\"China relies on the hidden and open hands of the market. It's not that it's against markets; it would be mad to be against markets, but as long as they are regulated. And that's what China insists upon: state-led investment to develop new technologies, control over its banks and its currency in order to be able to most efficiently involve itself in the market, and this, according to neo-liberals, shouldn't work at all,\" Woodward added.\n\nThis week, Meng filed a lawsuit against Canadian officials, claiming her constitutional rights were violated during her arrest.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in Canada's Supreme Court against federal government branches the Canadian Border Services Agency and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, asserts that officials, \"under the guise of a routine border check, unlawfully subjected [Meng] to detention, search and interrogation to extract evidence from her before she was arrested and provided with her rights under the Charter.\"\n\nThe lawsuit seeks damages for \"misfeasance in public office and false imprisonment based on alleged multiple failures of those Canadian government officials to comply with the rule of law,\" the statement by her lawyers said, Sputnik previously reported.\n\n\"She's [Meng] accused of having misled the US over the involvement of Huawei in activities which amounted to sanctions [busting] in Iran. [Some of the evidence the US is relying on is] incredibly old, and they have known it for years. [This] casts doubt on why, at this point, they [the US] moved against her, even if the evidence is true, which we don't know. She's taking this civil action in Canada claiming unfair arrest. Again, I think this is less about winning such a case,\" Woodward told Sputnik.\n\n\"On an extradition procedure, there's very little that can be done in terms of calling on evidence, whereas if there is a case on these grounds, she hopes that, she and her lawyers hope that, they get more of the evidence for the US' case [against Huawei] into the open,\" Woodward continued.",

    "text": "After Canada arrested Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou in December for possible extradition to the U.S., China detained over a dozen Canadians in apparent retaliation. This included former diplomat and now senior International Crisis Group (ICG) advisor Michael Kovrig, and Paektu Cultural Exchange founder Michael Spavor, both under suspicion of harming national security. Another Canadian, Robert Lloyd Schellenberg, was \u201carbitrarily\u201d sentenced to death during a one-day retrial for drug smuggling charges. Now, just two days before Meng is due to face her extradition hearing, Beijing has accused Kovrig of conducting espionage since 2017, and Spavor of providing him intelligence. For CNN, Steven Jiang and Ben Westcott report:\n\nIn a statement described as a \u201cmajor development\u201d in the case, former diplomat Michael Kovrig was accused of gathering and stealing \u201csensitive information and other intelligence\u201d in China since 2017. Businessman Michael Spavor is accused of providing intelligence to Kovrig, and is described as an \u201cimportant contact\u201d for the former diplomat. \u201cKovrig\u2019s alleged behavior of gathering and stealing secrets and other intelligence for a foreign power has seriously violated Chinese laws,\u201d the statement said. [\u2026] In response to Monday\u2019s revelations, ICG spokesman Hugh Pope told CNN that Kovrig\u2019s \u201cwork for Crisis Group has been entirely transparent and in the open, as all who follow his work can attest.\u201d \u201cVague and unsubstantiated accusations against him are unwarranted and unfair,\u201d Pope said. [Source]\n\nOver the weekend we were wondering how Beijing might respond to #Canada proceeding with the extradition hearing for senior Huawei Exec Meng Wanzhou and here you go Canadians Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig accused of working as a team to \"steal state secrets\" here in #China. https://t.co/ZFQxYtF6yL \u2014 Stephen McDonell (@StephenMcDonell) March 4, 2019\n\nFor the Guardian, Lily Kuo details Beijing and Ottawa\u2019s responses to the unfolding saga:\n\nCanadian diplomats have been allowed to see the two men. People familiar with the case have said Kovrig has not been allowed access to lawyers or family members, unlike Meng. Kovrig, who works for the International Crisis Group, focusing on north-east Asia, has denied any involvement in espionage. The Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau, said: \u201cWe are obviously very concerned by this position that China has taken. It is unfortunate that China continues to move forward on these arbitrary detentions.\u201d China has repeatedly demanded Meng\u2019s release and said Ottawa\u2019s decision last week amounted to a \u201csevere political incident\u201d. Canada said China had not made a specific link between the detentions and Meng\u2019s arrest, but experts and former diplomats believe Beijing is using their detentions as a way to put pressure on Canada. [\u2026] The Chinese commission said on Monday the next judicial proceedings would begin in due course and stressed that Kovrig\u2019s and Spavor\u2019s \u201clawful rights would be ensured\u201d. [Source]\n\nFor more on the new accusations on Kovrig and Spavor, see a CBC broadcast.\n\nMeng, who faces up to 30 years in prison if convicted under the Justice Department\u2019s criminal charges of bank and wire fraud, is suing the Canadian government, border agency, and federal police for being searched and interrogated without an attorney present. Reuters reports:\n\nIn a civil lawsuit filed in the British Columbia Supreme Court on Friday, Meng\u2019s lawyers said the manner in which officers obtained evidence and information from Meng constituted serious violations of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Meng is the daughter of Huawei\u2019s founder. It added that Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) officers deliberately delayed the immediate execution of an arrest warrant and unlawfully subjected Meng to detention, search and interrogation to extract evidence from her before she was arrested. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police \u2013 Canada\u2019s federal police \u2013 only exercised its arrest warrant three hours after Meng\u2019s \u201cunlawful\u201d detention at the airport, the lawsuit added. [\u2026] The lawsuit further alleged that Meng was directed to surrender all her electronic devices, computers and passwords and that CBSA officers then unlawfully opened and viewed the contents of the seized devices in violation of her right to privacy. CBSA officers also searched Meng\u2019s luggage in violation of the right to privacy, the lawsuit said. \u201cThe CBSA Officers knew or were recklessly indifferent to the fact that they had no authority to conduct such a search, which search was performed under the false pretense of a routine customs or immigration related examination,\u201d according to the lawsuit. [Source]\n\nFor CNN Business, Sherisse Pham details how Meng\u2019s attorneys believe she was intentionally misled to surrender her passwords:\n\nAfter Meng got off a flight from Hong Kong, officers from the Canada Border Services Agency stopped her and told her to surrender all her electronic devices, which included \u201ctwo personal cellphones, an iPad, and a personal computer,\u201d according to the lawsuit. Officers later asked for the devices\u2019 passwords, which Meng surrendered believing she had no choice as the officials \u201cintentionally failed to advise her of the true reasons for her detention, her right to counsel, and her right to silence.\u201d Only after searching and questioning her did the border officers turn her over to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), which formally arrested her. As a direct result of the detention, Meng suffered damages including mental distress, anxiety and loss of liberty, the lawsuit says. She has severe hypertension, for which she was hospitalized after her arrest. [\u2026] At a regular news briefing Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang reiterated Beijing\u2019s position that Canada and the United States \u201cabused their bilateral extradition treaty\u201d and \u201cseverely infringed\u201d Meng\u2019s rights. He urged the US government to withdraw the arrest warrant and extradition request for Meng, and the Canadian government to immediately release her. [Source]\n\nAn opinion essay at Bloomberg asks whether suing Ottawa would further damage Huawei\u2019s already compromised global public image. Meanwhile, The New York Times has revealed that Huawei is also planning to sue the U.S. for banning its products from federal agency use:\n\nThe lawsuit is to be filed in the Eastern District of Texas, where Huawei has its American headquarters, according to the people, who requested anonymity to discuss confidential plans. The company plans to announce the suit this week. The move could be aimed at forcing the United States government to make its case against the Chinese equipment maker more publicly. It is part of a broad push by Huawei to defend itself against a campaign led by the United States to undermine the company, which Washington sees as a security threat. Executives have spoken out strongly against America\u2019s actions, and new marketing campaigns have been aimed at mending the company\u2019s image among consumers. [\u2026] The lawsuit against the United States is expected to challenge a section of a defense spending authorization law that was approved last year. The provision blocks executive agencies from using telecom equipment made by Huawei and another Chinese company, ZTE. According to one of the people familiar with the matter, Huawei is likely to argue that the provision is a \u201cbill of attainder,\u201d or a legislative act that singles out a person or a group for punishment without trial. The Constitution forbids Congress to pass such bills. [Source]\n\nWhen Meng is scheduled to appear in court on March 6, the proceedings will \u201cconfirm that a writ of court has been issued and schedule a date for the extradition hearing,\u201d according to AFP.

    "description": "Attorneys representing Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's CFO, have filed a lawsuit with the British Columbia Supreme Court against the Government of Canada, Canada Border Services Agency, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police over her arrest on",
    "text": "Attorneys representing Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's CFO, have filed a lawsuit with the British Columbia Supreme Court against the Government of Canada, Canada Border Services Agency, and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police over her arrest on December 1 at Vancouver's airport. That request took place at the request of the U.S.\n\nAttorneys say the due protocol wasn\u2019t followed during her arrest and the officials overstepped their authority. They allege that a Canadian official and the Canadian Border Services Agency officers, despite having orders for the immediate arrest of Meng, delayed the process and violated the orders of the court. While pretending to carry out a routine border check, the officials apparently illegally detained and interrogated her to extract evidence before formally arresting here and telling her about her right to counsel.\n\nThe lawsuit says that although international travelers can be subjected to routine questioning, Meng\u2019s charter rights were violated as she was being questioned in relation to her arrest. The Canada Border Service Agency agents apparently confiscated her electronic devices, got passwords, and viewed the contents unlawfully while keeping her in the dark about the reason for her detention as they knew they wouldn\u2019t be able to get the information they were looking for if she was arrested immediately. She was finally told about her arrest and her rights after three hours.\n\nMeng is now seeking damages for false imprisonment and misfeasance in public office during her detention at the airport on December 1. She is currently out on bail and the Canadian authorities have started the official proceedings to extradite her from Canada to the U.S. She is due to appear in court on March 6, when a date would be set for the extradition hearing.\n\nMeng is the daughter of Huawei's founder, Ren Zhengfei, and the U.S. government has filed a plethora of charges against the Chinese company. The U.S. prosecutors say that Meng misled banks about Huawei\u2019s dealing which potentially breached Iran trade sanctions. The prosecutors argue that the fraudulent financial scheme can undermine the security of the U.S. Meng has denied all the charges levied against her and China says that the extradition process is politically motivated. Huawei is the second largest smartphone maker in the world and China believes that the arrest is an attempt to hurt the company.\n\nThe arrest has soured relations between China and the United States. China has also expressed its dissatisfaction with the proceedings. In an apparent bid to retaliate, the country has detained two Canadian citizens, former diplomat Michael Kovrig and entrepreneur Michael Spavor. Both have been denied access to a lawyer.\n\nWhen asked if the U.S. might drop criminal charges against Huawei, the U.S. President Donald Trump said recently that he will discuss the issue with the attorneys in the coming weeks. So, there is a possibility that the president could intervene and cool down the matter a bit. All in all, we'll have to wait and see what will happen, but things are getting out of hand, it seems, and they'll hopefully calm down in the near future.",

    "description": "Lawyers for Meng Wanzhou said Sunday they filed a notice of civil claim in the British Columbia Supreme Court.",
    "text": "Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou claims no one told her she was being arrested until after she had endured three hours of interrogation and searches by border agents, according to a civil suit filed Friday against the Canadian government, its border agency and the national police force.\n\nWanzhou is now suing three unnamed Canada Border Services Agency officers, RCMP Const. Winston Yep and the Attorney General of Canada in a civil suit filed Friday in B.C. Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cAs the claim speaks for itself and the matter is now before the courts, no further comments are necessary or appropriate at this time,\u201d read a statement shared by Gudmundseth Mickelson LLP, which is representing Meng.\n\nOn Dec. 1, 2018, Canada arrested the daughter of Huawei\u2019s founder at the request of the U.S. at Vancouver International Airport. Meng is wanted on fraud charges that she misled banks about the company\u2019s business dealings in Iran.\n\nMeng\u2019s suit says that instead of immediately arresting her or informing her why she was being pulled aside, authorities interrogated her \u201cunder the guise of a routine customs\u201d examination and used the opportunity to \u201ccompel her to provide evidence and information.\u201d\n\nRelated\n\nThe claim notes that an arrest warrant for Meng was issued the night before her scheduled Dec. 1 stopover at YVR but alleges Yep \u201cintentionally delayed the immediate execution of the warrant, contrary to the order of the court\u201d until after she had been detained, searched and interrogated by CBSA officers.\n\nMeng alleges she was ordered by CBSA to surrender two personal cellphones, an iPad and a personal computer. An unnamed CBSA officer then requested Meng\u2019s passwords and, according to the claim, searched the devices. The claim notes that Meng believed she had no choice but to hand over the devices and passwords.\n\n\u201cDespite having detained the plaintiff, the CBSA officers did not promptly inform the plaintiff of the reasons for her detention, afford her an opportunity to retain and instruct legal counsel without delay, or inform her of her right to do so under the Charter,\u201d read the suit.\n\nThe suit claims Meng wasn\u2019t told the reasons for her detainment and that she wasn\u2019t officially arrested until three hours after she was first stopped by CBSA officers.\n\nMeng\u2019s suit now seeks a declaration that her Charter rights were infringed, tort and punitive damages, and special and other costs.\n\nThe claim has not yet been tested in court.\n\nOn Friday, the federal Justice Department had green-lit an extradition case against Wanzhou. Since her arrest in December, Canada\u2019s relationship with China \u2014 its second-biggest trading partner \u2014 has been strained. Friday\u2019s development seemed to take into consideration the sensitive nature of Meng\u2019s case.\n\nMeng\u2019s extradition case goes back to B.C. Supreme Court on Wednesday. It will not determine whether Meng is guilty or innocent; that trial will take place in the United States.\n\nIn recent days, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had also come under fire by Chinese government officials after Trudeau and those connected to his office were alleged to have interfered in the prosecution of engineering firm SNC-Lavalin. Trudeau had previously said the Canadian government could not intervene in Meng\u2019s case, leading Chinese officials to call his approach inconsistent.\n\n\u2014 with files from Canadian Press, Associated Press\n\nsip@postmedia.com\n\ntwitter.com/stephanie_ip",

    "text": "HONG KONG/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Chinese telecoms equipment maker Huawei Technologies sued the U.S. government on Thursday, saying a law limiting its American business was unconstitutional, ratcheting up its fight back against a government bent on closing it out of global markets.\n\nHuawei said it had filed a complaint in a federal court in Texas challenging Section 889 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), signed into law by U.S. President Donald Trump in August, which bars federal agencies and their contractors from procuring its equipment and services.\n\nThe lawsuit marks the latest confrontation between China and the United States, which spent most of 2018 slapping import tariffs on billions of dollars worth of each other\u2019s goods. The year ended with the arrest of Huawei\u2019s chief financial officer in Canada at U.S. request, to the consternation of China.\n\nLong before Trump initiated the trade war, Huawei\u2019s activities were under scrutiny by U.S. authorities, according to interviews with 10 people familiar with the Huawei probes and documents related to the investigations seen by Reuters.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Congress has repeatedly failed to produce any evidence to support its restrictions on Huawei products. We are compelled to take this legal action as a proper and last resort,\u201d Huawei Rotating Chairman Guo Ping said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThis ban not only is unlawful, but also restricts Huawei from engaging in fair competition, ultimately harming U.S. consumers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe look forward to the court\u2019s verdict.\u201d\n\nWhile Huawei had very little share of the U.S. market before the bill, it is the world\u2019s biggest telecoms gear maker and is seeking to be at the forefront of a global rollout of fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks and services.\n\nIn its lawsuit, Huawei said its \u201cequipment and services are subject to advanced security procedures, and no backdoors, implants, or other intentional security vulnerabilities have been documented in any of the more than 170 countries in the world where Huawei equipment and services are used.\u201d\n\nThe privately owned firm has embarked on a public relations and legal offensive as Washington lobbies allies to abandon Huawei when building 5G networks, focusing on a 2017 Chinese law requiring companies to cooperate with national intelligence work.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Government is sparing no effort to smear the company and mislead the public,\u201d Guo said in a news briefing at Huawei\u2019s headquarters in southern China.\n\nThe U.S. State Department declined comment on the lawsuit on Thursday.\n\n\u201cMore generally,\u201d State Department spokesman Robert Palladino told reporters, \u201cthe United States advocates for secure telecom networks and supply chains that are free from suppliers subject to foreign government control or undue influence which would pose risks of unauthorized access and malicious cyber activity.\u201d\n\nU.S. Representative Mike Conaway, a Texas Republican who has sponsored anti-Huawei legislation, called the Huawei lawsuit \u201cbogus.\u201d\n\n\u201cNO PROOF\u201d\n\nThe NDAA bans the U.S. government from doing business with Huawei or compatriot peer ZTE Corp or from doing business with any company that has equipment from the two companies as a \u201csubstantial or essential component\u201d of their system.\n\nIn its lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Texas, Huawei argues that the section in question is illegal because it could sharply limit the company\u2019s ability to do business in the United States despite no proof of wrongdoing.\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges that Huawei has been denied due process and that Congress, by stripping Huawei of commercial opportunities, has violated the \u201cseparation of powers\u201d portion of the U.S. Constitution by doing the work of the courts.\n\nChinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said he had no information on whether China\u2019s government may also seek legal action against the U.S. law, but added Huawei\u2019s move is \u201ctotally reasonable and totally understandable.\u201d\n\nThe Huawei brand logo is seen above a store of the telecoms equipment maker in Beijing, China, March 7, 2019. REUTERS/Thomas Peter\n\nUPHILL BATTLE\n\nSome legal experts said Huawei\u2019s lawsuit is likely to be dismissed because U.S. courts are reluctant to second-guess national security determinations by other branches of government.\n\nThe lawsuit \u201cwill be an uphill battle because Congress has broad authority to protect us from perceived national security threats,\u201d said Franklin Turner, a government contracts lawyer at McCarter & English.\n\nIn November, a federal appeals court rejected a similar lawsuit filed by Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab, which was challenging a ban on the use of its software in U.S. government networks.\n\nThe Texas court hearing Huawei\u2019s case will not be bound by that decision, but will likely adopt its reasoning because of similarities in the two disputes, said Steven Schwinn, a professor at the John Marshall Law School in Chicago.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how (Huawei) can really escape that result,\u201d said Schwinn.\n\nHuawei\u2019s chief legal officer, Song Liuping, said the two cases were different in terms of evidence and scope, and that the Chinese company\u2019s case had \u201cfull merits.\u201d\n\nIf a judge decides Huawei has a plausible claim, the case will proceed to the discovery phase, in which internal documents are shared and U.S. government officials could be forced to provide testimony and lay out their security concerns.\n\nRETRIBUTION\n\nThe legal action compares with a more restrained response in December emphasizing \u201ctrust in justice\u201d after the arrest of Chief Financial Officer Sabrina Meng Wanzhou.\n\nA man enters a Huawei shop in Beijing, China, March 7, 2019. REUTERS/Thomas Peter\n\nHuawei founder Ren Zhengfei later said Meng\u2019s arrest was politically motivated and \u201cnot acceptable.\u201d\n\nMeng - Ren\u2019s daughter - is accused by the United States of bank and wire fraud related to breaches of trade sanctions against Iran. Canada approved extradition proceedings on March 1, but Meng has since sued Canada\u2019s government for procedural wrongs in her arrest. The next court hearing is set for May 8.\n\nThe case strained Canada\u2019s relations with China, which this week accused two arrested Canadians of stealing state secrets and blocked Canadian canola imports.\n\nMeng is under house arrest in Vancouver. It is unclear where the two Canadians are being detained in China, and at least one does not have access to legal representation, sources previously told Reuters.",

Lawyers for Meng Wanzhou said Sunday that they filed a notice of civil claim in the British Columbia Supreme Court. Canada arrested the daughter of Huawei\u2019s founder at the request of the United States on Dec. 1 at Vancouver\u2019s airport. Meng is wanted on fraud charges that allege she misled banks about the company\u2019s business dealings in Iran. The suit says that instead of immediately arresting Meng, the authorities interrogated her \u2018\u2018under the guise of a routine customs\u2019\u2019 examination and used the opportunity to \u2018\u2018compel her to provide evidence and information.\u2019\u2019 The suit alleges agents seized her electronic devices, obtained passwords, and unlawfully viewed the contents and intentionally failed to advise her of the true reasons for her detention. The suit said only after three hours was she told she was under arrest and had the right to counsel. Meng is out on bail in Vancouver, awaiting extradition proceedings. Her arrest set off a diplomatic furor. Beijing has accused Washington of a politically motivated attempt to hurt a potential competitor to US technology vendors. China detained former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and Canadian entrepreneur Michael Spavor on Dec. 10 in an apparent attempt to pressure Canada to release Meng. \u2014 ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nTECHNOLOGY\n\nUS-built capsule with a dummy aboard docks at space station\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA sleek new American-built capsule with just a test dummy aboard docked smoothly with the International Space Station on Sunday, bringing the United States a big step closer to getting back in the business of launching astronauts. The bullet-shaped Dragon capsule, developed by Elon Musk\u2019s SpaceX company under contract to NASA, closed in on the orbiting station nearly 260 miles above the Pacific Ocean and, flying autonomously, linked up on its own, without the help of the robotic arm that\u2019s normally used. The three US, Canadian, and Russian crew members aboard the space station watched the rendezvous via TV cameras. It was the first time in eight years a US-made spacecraft capable of carrying humans had flown to the space station. If the six-day test flight goes well, a Dragon capsule could take two NASA astronauts to the outpost this summer. Since NASA retired the space shuttle in 2011, the United States has been hitching rides to and from the space station aboard Russian Soyuz spacecraft. In the meantime, NASA is paying SpaceX and Boeing to build and operate America\u2019s next generation of rocket ships. SpaceX already has made 16 trips to the space station using cargo Dragons. The version designed for humans is slightly bigger and safer. \u2014 ASSOCIATED PRESS",

    "text": "Huawei's financial results for 2018 are out, and the Chinese tech giant is making a killing.\n\nThe company posted 721.2 billion yuan ($107.4 billion) in revenue \u2014 19.5 percent growth compared to 2017, and the first time the company surpassed the $100 billion yearly revenue mark. Net profit was 59.3 billion yuan ($8.8 billion), a 25.1 percent year-over-year increase.\n\nAnd yet, Huawei's shunned by the U.S., the company CFO remains under house arrest under allegations of fraud, and a British government-led committee just released a scathing report saying the company's software may be buggy and insecure.\n\nYou could recap Huawei's year like this: The use of Huawei's 5G equipment by government agencies is banned in the U.S., Australia and New Zealand, and numerous other countries are looking into banning Huawei's equipment as well, due to spying concerns (which Huawei has vehemently denied). Just yesterday, the British report said that, while Huawei may not be deliberately spying on anyone, the company had poor oversight of its component suppliers and that its software might be buggy (Huawei said it understands the concerns and takes them seriously). Finally, the company CFO Wanzhou Meng, arrested in Canada last December, is still awaiting possible extradition to the U.S., where she is charged for wire fraud and bank fraud.\n\nHuawei\u2019s 2018 revenue and net profit see double digit growth, 19.5% and 25.1% respectively. Read our annual report to learn more about the statistics and the facts behind the advancement: https://t.co/ffme3oYyKI pic.twitter.com/VDHifR5tpn \u2014 Huawei Technologies (@Huawei) March 29, 2019\n\nBut looking at the company's earnings report, you'd think that Huawei's never been doing better. The company sold more than 200 million phones in 2018, and ended the year as the third largest smartphone maker by shipments, behind Samsung and Apple, according to Gartner and Canalys (Huawei temporarily overtook Apple to become the global number two smartphone maker in August last year). But Huawei is making more money than ever from phone sales. The company's consumer business is booming, having grown 45.1 percent year-over-year. Its carrier business \u2014 which includes the company's 5G equipment business \u2014 was down slightly (1.3 percent) compared to 2017, but that's unsurprising given all the negative press and outright bans in some places.\n\nJust days ago, the company launched a new flagship smartphone, the Huawei P30 Pro, at a lavish event in Paris. Its pricing in Europe is slightly higher than that of its predecessor, the P20 Pro at launch, and the P20 Pro was more expensive than the P10. That's hardly surprising \u2014 with sales booming, Huawei's able to raise prices of its products, which are now on par with flagship product prices of its nearest competitors, Samsung and Apple. In fact, the Huawei Mate X \u2014 a snazzy folding phone which is yet to hit the market \u2014 is priced even higher than the upcoming folding phone from Samsung. By some measures, it's also more promising, as well.\n\nHere's the kicker: Despite all the negative press, the company feels it can sustain this growth in the future. According to CNBC, Huawei chairman Guo Ping said the company's revenue grew 30 percent year-over-year in January and February, and that Huawei expects double-digit growth in 2019. After a year like this, it doesn't seem impossible.",

    "text": "WINNIPEG, Manitoba (AP) \u2014 One of Canada\u2019s largest grain processors said Tuesday that China has revoked its permit to export canola there, a move that some saw as retaliation for the Canadian government\u2019s arrest of a top executive for the Chinese tech giant Huawei.\n\nChina\u2019s action against Richardson International Ltd. following non-compliance notices alleging that some imports from Canada were contaminated with pests or bacteria. Canada disputes that claim.\n\n\u201cI am very concerned by what we\u2019ve heard has happened to Richardson. We do not believe there\u2019s any scientific basis for this,\u201d Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said in Montreal. \u201cWe are working very, very hard with the Chinese government on this issue.\u201d\n\nThe loss of the shipping permit comes as Canada is proceeding with an extradition hearing for Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou, who is the daughter of Huawei\u2019s founder. She was arrested by Canada at the request of the U.S., where she is wanted on fraud charges.\n\nIt wouldn\u2019t be the first time Beijing has retaliated against nations that offend it. China suspended its bilateral trade deal with Norway and restricted imports of Norwegian salmon after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Chinese political prisoner Liu Xiaobo in 2010.\n\nBritain and other countries were retaliated against over meetings with the Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, considered a dangerous separatist by Beijing.\n\nCanadian Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau said in a statement that the government was closely monitoring the situation and any potential impact on Canada\u2019s agricultural trading relationship with China.\n\nShe said the Canadian Food Inspection Agency conducted further investigations after China issued the notices of non-compliance on canola seed imports, including nine since January, and said the agency had not identified any pests or bacteria of concern.\n\nChina is the destination for about 40 percent of Canada\u2019s canola exports, and the revocation of Richardson\u2019s permit hurts the entire value chain of industries involved in the market, the Canola Council of Canada said.\n\n\u201cWe are aware of challenges our exporters have faced shipping to China \u2014 these are concerning as they create instability and add costs,\u201d council spokeswoman Heidi Dancho said by email.\n\nDancho said that while the diplomatic frictions between China and Canada are concerning, there is no clear evidence they are related to the canola dispute.\n\nNeil Townsend, senior market analyst at FarmLink, however, said he thinks there is a definite link to the Huawei case. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt China\u2019s mad at us,\u201d he said.\n\nBeijing has warned of serious consequences if Meng is not released. China arrested two Canadians on Dec. 10 in what was widely seen as an attempt to pressure Canada to release Meng.\n\nAfter Meng\u2019s arrest, a Chinese court also sentenced a Canadian to death in a sudden retrial, overturning a 15-year prison term handed down earlier.\n\nChina\u2019s move hits a vital crop for western Canada, and comes after canola prices have already been hit by China\u2019s retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural exports. The industry should be concerned because if China cuts back on buying it would hit prices further, Townsend said.\n\n\u201cWith China kind of saying \u2014 because they\u2019re mad about the Huawei thing \u2014 they\u2019re basically saying like, \u201cOh, we\u2019re not going to buy any more,'\u201d Townsend said.\n\nHe said he suspects Richardson was targeted since it is the largest exporter that is fully Canadian-owned.",

    "description": "The surprise arrest of Huawei's chief financial officer in December quickly turned the executive, Meng Wanzhou, into a central figure in a trade war between two economic superpowers.",
    "text": "Meng Wanzhou, Executive Board Director of the Chinese technology giant Huawei, attends a session of the VTB Capital Investment Forum \"Russia Calling!\" in Moscow in 2014. (Reuters photo)\n\nThe surprise arrest of Huawei's chief financial officer in December quickly turned the executive, Meng Wanzhou, into a central figure in a trade war between two economic superpowers.\n\nUS President Donald Trump said he would consider intervening in her case - a potential action he alluded to again two weeks ago - if it would help close a trade deal with China.\n\nBut US probes of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd for allegedly evading US sanctions on Iran were not rooted in Trump\u2019s trade aspirations. Long before Trump initiated a bitter trade war with China, Huawei activities were under scrutiny by US authorities, according to interviews with ten people familiar with the Huawei probes and documents related to the investigations.\n\nThe US focus on Huawei intensified after years of investigation into smaller Chinese rival ZTE Corp, and relied in part on information collected from devices of company employees traveling through airports.\n\nTwo of the sources said a critical point took place in August 2017, when deputy US Attorney General Rod Rosenstein - best known for his oversight of special counsel Robert Mueller's probe of Russian interference in the US election \u2013 handed a lead role to Brooklyn prosecutors to pursue possible bank fraud charges against Huawei.\n\nFifteen months later, that strategy would help land Meng in a Canadian jail.\n\nThe US investigations of China's top telecom companies were spurred by news reports over six years ago, detailing possible Iran sanctions violations by both ZTE and Huawei, as well as close ties between Huawei and Skycom Tech Co Ltd - a suspected front company doing business in Iran.\n\nA spokesman for Huawei, the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker, has denied the charges in the sanctions case, and did not provide further comment. Meng has said she is innocent of the charges. ZTE, which pleaded guilty in 2017 for illegally shipping US goods to Iran, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nUS Justice Department spokeswoman Nicole Navas Oxman said the government pursues cases \"free of any political interference and follows the evidence and rule of law in pursuing criminal charges.\"\n\nAIRPORT EVIDENCE GRAB\n\nOn December 1, 2018, Meng was stopped at Vancouver International Airport as she walked up the jetway after her flight, according to a lawsuit she filed on Friday accusing the Canadian government of violating her rights. Border officers examined her passport and escorted her to an area for secondary screenings.\n\nWhile there, she was instructed to surrender her two mobile phones, an iPad and a personal computer, along with their passwords, the suit alleges, and the officers viewed the devices' contents.\n\nReuters has not been able to determine what information was found on Meng\u2019s devices, but it is not the first time she and other Chinese telecom executives have turned over such property to border patrol agents.\n\nIn the years leading up to the Huawei indictment, US officials had been capturing information that would influence the investigation when telecom executives passed through US airports, according to a number of sources familiar with the Huawei and ZTE investigations and the Meng indictment.\n\nFor example, Meng arrived in the United States via John F Kennedy International Airport in early 2014. The indictment says investigators found \"suggested talking points\" on one of her electronic devices, stating among other things that Huawei\u2019s relationship with Skycom was \"normal business cooperation.\"\n\nMeng had been pulled into a secondary screening at the airport that time as well, and her electronic devices were taken, according to one person familiar with the stop. After a couple of hours, the devices were returned and she was freed to go, the person said.\n\nAnother border search, this time on September 12, 2014, of executives from rival ZTE also supported US investigators long-held suspicions of how Huawei might have been doing illicit business in countries subject to US sanctions, one of the sources said.\n\nZTE's CFO at the time was stopped at Boston's Logan Airport after flying in from London with an assistant, the person said.\n\nThe assistant was carrying a Lenovo laptop containing a confidential ZTE document, dated August 25, 2011 and signed by four top executives, about the need to establish front companies to supply US procured items needed for projects in embargoed countries.\n\nThe airport stop provided key evidence against ZTE in its legal battle with the United States, according to US officials. But it also identified a company as \"F7\" and how it used a front company to serve as its agent for contracts in sanctioned countries. F7 was Huawei, according to the individuals familiar with the ZTE and Huawei investigations.\n\nThe document was posted on the US Commerce Department website in March 2016 when ZTE was placed on a list of companies that were restricted from buying parts and components from US suppliers. Shortly after the public posting, the New York Times reported that the description of F7 offered by ZTE matched Huawei.\n\nA month later, the Commerce Department sent a subpoena to Huawei in the United States demanding information on the company's exporting American technology to Iran, according to a court document and one of the people familiar with the Huawei probe.\n\nFROM ZTE TO HUAWEI\n\nWith the case against ZTE wrapping up, more than a dozen people from Departments of Treasury, Commerce, Homeland Security and Justice, gathered in Washington on February 14, 2017 and talked about how they were moving forward against Huawei, according to a person familiar with matter.\n\nBrooklyn prosecutors discussed the relationship between Huawei and HSBC, a bank that was required to cooperate with US prosecutors in any investigation until the end of 2017 for violating US anti-money laundering and sanctions laws, the person added.\n\nIn late 2016, HSBC began to conduct an internal bank probe of Huawei. In the weeks and months following the meeting, HSBC helped authorities obtain evidence of links between Skycom and Huawei, documents reviewed by Reuters show. The probe found Meng met in 2013 with a HSBC banker. She later gave him a copy of the PowerPoint presentation, which the US indictment says misrepresented Huawei\u2019s control of Skycom.\n\nHSBC said that it provided information in response to demands from the Justice Department.\n\nThe US Attorney's office in Washington, DC, meanwhile, pursued a more traditional export control investigation against Huawei, which included the accusations of attempted illegal shipments of computers to Iran disclosed in the Reuters 2012 story.\n\nA grand jury subpoena was issued to the US subsidiary of the company in April 2017, the first clear sign to Huawei that the probe had turned criminal.\n\nArmed with that knowledge, the company moved US-based Chinese employees who knew about its Iranian dealings out of the country and otherwise concealed and destroyed evidence, the prosecutors allege. Meng and other Huawei executives also began to avoid travel to the United States, prosecutors say.\n\nIn the late summer of 2017, according to two of the sources close to the Huawei investigation, Rosenstein chose Brooklyn as the venue to file charges and the Washington US Attorney's office dropped out of the case. Brooklyn was already working with a money laundering unit at the Justice Department. The national security division also merged with the Brooklyn prosecution team.\n\nLegal experts said since most evidence of any illegal US goods in Iran presumably existed outside the jurisdiction of US authorities, the bank fraud route presented a potentially quicker path to indictment. They added that bank fraud charges are more likely to lead to arrest by other countries for extradition to the United States than export controls or sanctions violations, and have a longer statute of limitations.\n\nMeng and the company were charged with bank and wire fraud. The PowerPoint presentation\u2019s \u201cnumerous misrepresentations\u201d were central to the charges brought against Meng herself, the indictment shows.\n\nTwelve months after Brooklyn got the case, prosecutors secretly obtained a warrant for Meng's arrest.\n\nLess than four months later they learned she was stopping in Vancouver en route to Mexico on Dec 1, and asked the Canadians to detain her at the airport.",

    "text": "An executive of Chinese tech giant Huawei is suing the Canadian government, its border agency and the national police force, saying they detained, searched and interrogated her before telling her she was under arrest.\n\nADVERTISING Read more\n\nLawyers for Meng Wanzhou said Sunday they filed a notice of civil claim in the British Columbia Supreme Court. Canada arrested Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, at the request of the US on December 1 at Vancouver's airport. She is wanted on fraud charges that she misled banks about the company's business dealings in Iran.\n\nThe suit alleges that instead of immediately arresting her, authorities interrogated Meng \"under the guise of a routine customs\" examination and used the opportunity to \"compel her to provide evidence and information.\" The suit alleges Canada Border Service Agency agents seized her electronic devices, obtained passwords and unlawfully viewed the contents and intentionally failed to adviser her of the true reasons for her detention. The suit said only after three hours was she told she was under arrest and had right to counsel.\n\n\"This case concerns a deliberate and pre-meditated effort on the part of the defendant officers to obtain evidence and information from the plaintiff in a manner which they knew constituted serious violations of the plaintiff's rights,\" the claim says.\n\nMeng is out on bail and living in Vancouver awaiting extradition proceedings.\n\nOn Friday, Canadian Justice Department officials gave the go-ahead for her extradition proceedings to begin. Meng is due in court Wednesday to set a date for the proceedings to start. It could be several months or even years before her case is resolved.\n\nSino-Canadian relations are severely strained\n\nMeng's arrest set off a diplomatic furor and severely strained Canadian relations with China. Beijing has accused Washington of a politically motivated attempt to hurt the company.\n\nChina detained former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and Canadian entrepreneur Michael Spavor on Dec. 10 in an apparent attempt to pressure Canada to release Meng.\n\nA Chinese court also sentenced a Canadian to death in a sudden retrial, overturning a 15-year prison term handed down earlier. Kovrig and Spavor haven't had access to a lawyer or to their families since being arrested.\n\nNicholas Dorion, a spokesman for the Canada Border Services Agency, said it's not a practice of the agency to comment ?on legal matters that are before the courts. A justice department spokesman referred comment to the border agency and a spokesman of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said they were unlikely to comment Sunday.\n\nGary Botting, a Vancouver extradition lawyer who is not representing Meng, said Canada's Border Services Agency tends to overstep.\n\n\"They took her under custody without telling her why,\" Botting said. \"They disguised the real reason why they detained her. Her rights were violated.\"\n\nBotting said they had no reason to detain her as she had travelled to Canada many times before. \"They are trying to get all this information ahead of time and they know ultimately an arrest was in the works,\" he said.\n\nJulian Ku, senior associate dean for academic affairs at Hofstra Law, noted the civil action is separate and apart from Meng's extradition proceeding. He said the lawsuit will allow her to argue she is being unfairly treated and support her broader public relations claim that the detention is part of a US and Canadian political conspiracy against Huawei.\n\n(AP)",

    "description": "Meng Wanzhou, the embattled Huawei Chief Financial Officer who hasn't been at her post for nearly four months now, with her prospects of returning to it looking grimmer by the day, has plenty of reasons",
    "text": "Meng Wanzhou, the embattled Huawei Chief Financial Officer who hasn't been at her post for nearly four months now, with her prospects of returning to it looking grimmer by the day, has plenty of reasons to be displeased with her latest visit to Canada that was supposed to only take an hour or so in early December as she was switching flights on her way to Mexico, yet turned into a diplomatic incident unlike any other in recent memory.\n\nAdding to the 47-year-old's pile of misery is a new revelation stemming from her arrest made on the request of the United States Department of Justice; as it turns out, the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei and one of the key people at the world's second-largest smartphone manufacturer with a seemingly infinite portfolio of Android devices - is quite a big Apple fan.\n\nCanadian authorities seized a trio of devices from Ms. Meng as part of her arrest at the Vancouver International Airport: an iPhone, iPad, and a MacBook Air, a rather modest choice if such a thing exists within Apple's walled ecosystem. A court filing cited by Bloomberg reveals that the devices in questions are already a subject of a rather contained dispute between Canadian prosecutors and Ms. Meng's legal team. The Chinese side is trying to obtain a copy of all contents found on the devices, presumably encrypted as Ms. Meng surely had the common sense not to have her electronics laying around unlocked. Afterward, her legal representation wants to see the three gadgets sealed, as written in their request.\n\nThe Canadian government doesn't appear to be overly concerned with the troubled industry veteran's desires, having already arranged for her devices to be handed over to the competent British Columbia Supreme Court Registry. There, authorized Ottawa officials will review whether a solicitor-client privilege Ms. Meng's defense is using as the basis for the request holds up to a sufficient degree, i.e. the one that would see the filing honored.\n\nMs. Meng wasn't entirely free of Huawei-made devices when she ended up being detained on suspicion of various international crimes; a Mate 20 RS Porsche Design was confiscated from her as well, with the device in question being the most powerful mobile gadget released by the Chinese firm to date, though it will be losing that title to the P30 line scheduled for a Paris launch tomorrow. That's still a rather poor ratio of Apple-to-Huawei devices, especially for a top executive of a company known for demoting workers using iPhones. It was only last year that Huawei overtook Apple by handset shipments and sales, seizing the number two spot in the global market for the first time ever, with the Cupertino-based tech giant now being its closest rival.\n\nAs for other electronics, Canadian authorities found several SIM cards and a ScanDisk flash drive on her person.\n\nHer apparent admiration of Apple devices does not add much intrigue to the already endlessly curious care of Ms. Meng as she is a tough executive to a get a read on; not even her CFO tenure at Huawei is public knowledge as the Shenzen-based firm only revealed the list of its top executives back in 2011. That lack of transparency is one of the main gripes Washington holds against it, though its susceptibility to Beijing's control remains the main reason preventing the company from making any progress in the U.S. market.",

    "description": "The U.S. campaign against China's Huawei is having little impact on the company's sales and it is unlikely many countries will follow the United States in banning Huawei from building next-generation mobile networks, its rotating Chairman Eric Xu said.",
    "text": "(In March 26 story, modifies paragraph 13 to show that Reuters could not independently verify Huawei\u2019s ownership structure; corrects paragraph 20 to show that Huawei is the No. 3 vendor of smartphones)\n\nFILE PHOTO: Eric Xu, CEO of Huawei, addresses media at Cebit, the world's biggest computer and software fair, in Hanover, Germany, March 14, 2016. REUTERS/Nigel Treblin\n\nBy Jonathan Weber and Sijia Jiang\n\nSHENZHEN/HONG KONG (Reuters) - The U.S. campaign against China\u2019s Huawei is having little impact on the company\u2019s sales and it is unlikely many countries will follow the United States in banning Huawei from building next-generation mobile networks, its rotating Chairman Eric Xu said.\n\n\u201cRecently we are seeing a large number of countries making their own decisions,\u201d Xu said during an interview at Huawei Technologies\u2019 headquarters in Shenzhen.\n\nWhile Australia has banned Huawei from 5G networks over security concerns, European Union countries such as Germany and France have indicated they are likely to ignore the U.S. call to shut out the telecoms giant.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s only Australia,\u201d Xu told Reuters reporters after a tour of the campus.\n\nXu affirmed that Huawei\u2019s revenue jumped 36 percent over the first two months of 2019 and was set for a 15 percent annual spike to $125 billion, underlining strength in its smartphone business and sales of computing and communications networks.\n\nHuawei has been facing mounting scrutiny, led by the United States, amid worries its equipment could be used by Beijing for spying. The company, however, says the concerns are unfounded.\n\nXu said he does not expect the United States to intensify its attack on the company by barring sales of U.S. components to Huawei, a move that almost put its compatriot ZTE Corp out of business last year before U.S. President Donald Trump lifted the ban.\n\nHuawei is the world\u2019s third-largest buyer of computer chips, many of which come from U.S. companies, and a sales ban would be disruptive to the global tech industry, Xu said.\n\nXu\u2019s comments come at a time when Huawei has sued the U.S. government over a law that restricts its market access.\n\nIn Canada, lawyers for Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of founder Ren Zhengfei, have sued the government over her Dec. 1 arrest at the behest of the United States. She was charged with bank and wire fraud to violate U.S. sanctions against Iran.\n\nCAMPUS TOUR\n\nHuawei, a privately held firm that offers few details about its internal operations, has in recent months offered media interviews and invited journalists to tour its facilities as part of a counter-attack against the allegations of spying.\n\nReuters reporters were invited on Monday to peruse files in Huawei\u2019s \u201cshare registry room\u201d where it keeps records on tens of thousands of employee shareholders.\n\nHuawei said the records show that the firm is owned by its employees and that its 74-year-old founder Ren owns just over 1 percent of the company. Reuters could not independently verify the ownership structure.\n\nMuch of the global scrutiny of Huawei stems from Ren\u2019s background with China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army, where he was a civilian engineer for nearly a decade until his departure in 1983 after helping to build its communications network.\n\nReuters also toured Huawei\u2019s new campus in Dongguan, near Shenzhen, that features buildings modeled on European cities including Paris and Heidelberg, connected by a special train imported from Switzerland.\n\nHowever, there was little activity on the campus, which is designed to house 18,000 workers, save a couple of black swans flitting about a lake.\n\nIn contrast, another Huawei facility nearby bustled with workers assembling smartphones on automated production lines.\n\nNEW GROWTH DRIVERS\n\nHuawei\u2019s growth is mainly being driven by its booming smartphone business and sales of computing and communications networks to government and business customers.\n\nFuture growth will also come \u201cprimarily\u201d from these, Xu said, with sales of equipment to telecom carriers growing at single digit rates.\n\nHuawei is the world\u2019s top producer of telecoms equipment and third-biggest maker of smartphones.\n\nOn Huawei\u2019s semiconductor operations, HiSilicon, Xu said the unit produced more than $7.5 billion worth of chips last year. That compares with an estimated $21 billon of chips that Huawei acquired from outside vendors.\n\nHiSilicon produces chip designs for Huawei\u2019s equipment mainly, with the manufacturing handled by so-called \u201cfoundry\u201d companies such as Taiwan\u2019s TSMC.\n\nSlideshow (20 Images)\n\nIt does sell chips to others for use in video cameras, television set-top boxes and some low-cost internet-connected devices, Xu said.\n\nHuawei will report its 2018 financial results at a press briefing on Friday, which over a hundred journalists are expected to attend, far more than in past years.\n\n\u201cThe United States should take quite a lot of the credit for making advertisements for Huawei,\u201d Xu quipped.",

    "description": "The lawsuit alleges that the global Huawei CFO was detained and interrogated by airport customs, and her electronic devices searched, before informing her that she was under arrest.",
    "text": "Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou is suing the Canadian government, police force, and border agency, claiming she was detained, searched, and interrogated before she was told that she was under arrest.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Meng was interrogated \"under the guise of a routine customs\" search, and was thereby compelled to \"provide evidence and information\" instead of being arrested.\n\nThe Canada Border Service Agency took her electronic devices and viewed the content after acquiring her passwords, the lawsuit alleges, without advising her of the real reason for her detention.\n\nThe Canadian Justice Department has approved Meng's extradition hearing to take place, with the CFO due in court on Wednesday this week to set a date for proceedings to begin.\n\nThe US indictment against Meng claims that during meetings with an unnamed banking institution in the US, she misrepresented Huawei's ownership and control of Iranian affiliate Skycom, as well as its compliance with UN, US, and EU sanctions.\n\nThe company is also facing counts for conspiracy to defraud the United States; conspiracy to violate the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA); violating the IEEPA; committing money laundering; and obstructing justice.\n\nHuawei is additionally facing allegations in a separate indictment that it conspired to steal intellectual property from T-Mobile and subsequently obstructed justice. The alleged activity occurred during 2012-13 and relates to Huawei's attempt to build a robot similar to the one T-Mobile was using to test mobile phones.\n\nHuawei pleaded not guilty last week to the federal charges of stealing trade secrets from T-Mobile, conspiracy, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice, the US Justice Department said, with a trial set for March 2, 2020.\n\nIf found guilty, Huawei would be fined either $5 million, or three times the value of the stolen trade secret, whichever is higher.\n\nIn an open letter over the weekend, Huawei board director Catherine Chen asked US media to not believe what they had heard about the company and \"come and see us\".\n\n\"In recent years, the US government has developed some misunderstandings about us. We would like to draw your attention to the facts,\" the letter says.\n\n\"We operate in more than 170 countries and regions, including countries like the UK, Germany, and France. We provide innovative and secure telecoms network equipment and smartphones to more than 3 billion people around the world.\"\n\nChen highlighted Huawei's work across innovation, university research programs, and disaster relief.\n\n\"There are only so many people we can reach out to. On behalf of Huawei, I would like to invite members of the US media to visit our campuses and meet our employees,\" Chen said.\n\n\"I hope that you can take what you see and hear back to your readers, viewers, and listeners, and share this message with them, to let them know that our doors are always open. We would like the US public to get to know us better, as we will you.\"\n\nWhile Huawei was chosen to build out South Korean carrier LG Uplus' 5G network, the Chinese tech giant's 5G solutions have been banned by Australia and the US, limited by New Zealand, and left off the vendor list of South Korea's largest carrier SK Telecom.\n\nThe US has also taken to warning central European nations and Canada against using Huawei for 5G. A bipartisan Bill was also introduced in the United States in January that, if passed, would ban the export of US chips and other components to Huawei and its compatriot ZTE.\n\nDespite this, the UK is still open to using Huawei; Italy has reportedly denied that it will ban Huawei; and Angela Merkel has set conditions for the company's participation in Germany's new mobile network, including guarantees from the company that it will not hand over information to the Chinese government.\n\nWith AAP\n\nRelated Coverage",

    "description": "The new cold war against China will be won not through ideology or even weaponry, but through economic pressure, and the winning strategy will not be one that weaponizes only America\u2019s greed. In this sense, by nickel-and-diming its allies, the US is effective\u2026",
    "text": "Mar 14, 2019\n\nThe new cold war against China will be won not through ideology or even weaponry, but through economic pressure, and the winning strategy will not be one that weaponizes only America\u2019s greed. In this sense, by nickel-and-diming its allies, the US is effectively disarming itself.\n\nLONDON \u2013 It is convenient to call the escalating geopolitical contest between the United States and China a \u201cnew cold war.\u201d But that description should not be allowed to obscure the obvious, though not yet sufficiently understood, reality that this new competition will differ radically from the Cold War between the US and the Soviet Union.\n\nRenewing Europe Mar 4, 2019 calls on EU citizens to focus on three goals ahead of the critical European Parliament election in May. Jose Luis Pelaez Inc/Getty Images A Better Populism Feb 27, 2019 argues that beggar-thy-neighbor policies cannot solve the problems facing declining communities. Wojtek Radwanski/AFP/Getty Images Europe, Please Wake Up Feb 11, 2019 argues that the EU cannot be saved without transforming its political party systems. Previous Next\n\nThe Cold War of the twentieth century pitted two rival military alliances against each other. By contrast, the Sino-American rivalry involves two economies that are closely integrated both with each other and with the rest of the world. The most decisive battles in today\u2019s cold war will thus be fought on the economic front (trade, technology, and investment), rather than in, say, the South China Sea or the Taiwan Strait.\n\nSome American strategic thinkers have recognized this, and now argue that, if the US is to win this cold war, it must sever its commercial ties with China \u2013 and persuade its allies to do the same. But, as the ongoing bilateral trade war demonstrates, this is easier said than done. Contrary to US President Donald Trump\u2019s claim that it would be \u201ceasy to win,\u201d that war has imposed such high costs, even as the US trade deficit continues to widen, that Trump now seems to be having second thoughts about further escalation.\n\nIf the US, with its strong geopolitical incentive, is struggling to bear the costs of an economic decoupling, its allies, most of which face no immediate Chinese security threat, will resist doing the same. Their reticence is obvious in their response to America\u2019s aggressive campaign against the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei.\n\nSo far, that campaign has included the arrest (in Canada) of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou and legal action against the company for violating sanctions against Iran and for stealing US technology. The Trump administration has also called on allies to keep Huawei \u2013 the global leader in next-generation 5G mobile technology \u2013 out of their wireless communication networks.\n\nThe case against entrusting Huawei to build 5G networks in Western countries is strong. Given the Chinese government\u2019s unfettered power over the country\u2019s companies, including Huawei technology in 5G networks could give rise to serious security risks. For countries that cannot afford the expensive equipment (and view Chinese domination as only a distant concern), those risks may be worth taking. But that is not the case for America\u2019s wealthy allies.\n\nSubscribe now Get unlimited access to OnPoint, the Big Picture, and the entire PS archive of more than 14,000 commentaries, plus our annual magazine, for less than $2 a week. SUBSCRIBE\n\nYet, so far, only Australia and New Zealand have complied with the US demand to ban Huawei. While Canada is considering joining them, European countries have defied the Trump administration, with the United Kingdom and Germany indicating that they would allow Huawei to participate in the construction of their 5G networks. South Korea and India have similarly resisted US pressure to exclude Huawei.\n\nDespite the national security implications, the fact remains that banning Huawei would result in higher costs and significant delays. Yet the US has offered no rewards or compensation to its wavering allies.\n\nThis underscores a key challenge that the US will likely confront in the new cold war. Though America is likely ultimately to come out on top, victory will not come cheap. Isolating China economically \u2013 which is crucial to gaining the upper hand \u2013 will require the US not only to shoulder its own costs, but also to compensate its allies for the losses they incur.\n\nVictory will not come fast, either, especially if the US remains so eager to secure short-term wins \u2013 such as Chinese promises to purchase large quantities of American soybeans and energy products \u2013 that it fails to encourage the systematic changes that would benefit it and its allies in the long run. Such opportunism makes US allies doubt America\u2019s resolve in an economic confrontation with China, fueling fear that they will shoulder high short-term costs for nothing.\n\nThe Trump administration has already displayed an utter lack of concern for its allies\u2019 economic interests. It is chiefly US allies that have been hurt by the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, and now the administration is threatening to go further, imposing a tariff specifically on European and Japanese automobiles. Trump has reportedly even been considering demanding that America\u2019s allies pay the full cost, plus 50%, of stationing US troops on their territory.\n\nTrump\u2019s approach reflects not just a lack of loyalty, but also a lack of vision for sustaining, let alone strengthening, America\u2019s own economic leverage. Recall that, almost immediately upon entering the White House, Trump withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a free-trade agreement that sought specifically to prevent Chinese economic domination in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nThe new cold war against China will be won not through ideology or even weaponry, but through the deployment of economic incentives to wage a geopolitical struggle. The winning strategy will not be one that weaponizes only America\u2019s greed. By nickel-and-diming its allies, the US is effectively disarming itself.",

    "text": "Meng Wanzhou, the Chinese telecom executive at the center of an escalating row between Ottawa and Beijing, was due in court in Canada Wednesday to get a date for a hearing into a US extradition request.\n\n\n\nMeng\u2019s arrest in Vancouver in December on a US warrant infuriated China, which arrested several Canadians days later in what was widely seen as retaliation.\n\n\n\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday said he was \u201cvery concerned\u201d over reports in Xinhua that two of the Canadians, including a former diplomat, were suspected of espionage.\n\n\n\nMeng, the chief financial officer of Huawei, a telecoms giant founded by her father, was changing planes in Vancouver when she was detained at Washington\u2019s request for allegedly violating US sanctions on Iran. Canada\u2019s justice department last week gave its nod for the case to proceed, saying evidence against Meng submitted by the United States was sufficient to put before a judge under its treaty obligations.\n\n\n\nMeng, 47, has been granted bail until the outcome of the case, which could take months or years.\n\n\n\nIf the judge rules in favor of extradition, Canada\u2019s attorney general would have the final say over whether to hand Meng over to US authorities. The US Justice Department accuses Huawei and Meng of circumventing US sanctions against Iran, but also, via two affiliates, of stealing trade secrets from US telecommunications group T-Mobile.\n\nThat was fast. #MengWanzhou #Huawei CFO extradition court hearing adjourned to May 8, but her civil suit against the Canadian government, federal police and border service is going forward separately also here in Vancouver. https://t.co/k19Xn6COaM ADVERTISEMENT \u2014 Joanna Chiu \u8d99\u6dc7\u6b23 (@joannachiu) March 6, 2019\n\n\n\nMeng has contested the accusations. Beijing denounced the US charges as the product of \u201cstrong political motivations\u201d and an attempt to undermine its flagship telecoms company. Huawei has strenuously denied any wrongdoing. Meng is also suing Canadian authorities, alleging her rights were violated when she was arrested in Vancouver.\n\n\n\nShe is seeking damages for \u201cmisfeasance in public office and false imprisonment,\u201d her attorneys Howard Mickelson and Allan Doolittle said in a statement. They charge Meng was improperly interrogated for three hours by the customs officers, officially as part of a routine inspection, before being served with her official arrest.\n\n\n\nDuring those three hours, the customs officers searched her phones and computers as well as her luggage, in violation of her rights, the lawyers said. Nine days after Meng\u2019s arrest, Chinese authorities detained two Canadians \u2014 former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor.\n\n\n\nA third Canadian, meanwhile, had his sentence for drug trafficking upped from 15 years in prison to death row. Trudeau has decried the arrests as arbitrary while insisting on a strict hands-off approach to the Meng case.\n\n\n\nHis former ambassador to China was sacked after he undermined that position by saying Meng had a \u201cstrong\u201d case against extradition, citing comments by US President Donald Trump, and later adding that it would be \u201cgreat for Canada\u201d if the US dropped the case. Earlier this week, meanwhile, Chinese state media reported that Kovrig and Spavor were suspected of spying and stealing state secrets, prompting Trudeau\u2019s expression of concern.\n\n",

    "text": "A 3D printed Huawei logo is placed on glass above a displayed U.S. flag in this illustration taken January 29, 2019. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/Files\n\nBy Sijia Jiang and Jan Wolfe\n\nHONG KONG/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Chinese telecoms equipment maker Huawei Technologies sued the U.S. government on Thursday, saying a law limiting its American business was unconstitutional, ratcheting up its fight back against a government bent on closing it out of global markets.\n\nHuawei said it had filed a complaint in a federal court in Texas challenging Section 889 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), signed into law by U.S. President Donald Trump in August, which bars federal agencies and their contractors from procuring its equipment and services.\n\nThe lawsuit marks the latest confrontation between China and the United States, which spent most of 2018 slapping import tariffs on billions of dollars worth of each other's goods. The year ended with the arrest of Huawei's chief financial officer in Canada at U.S. request, to the consternation of China.\n\nLong before Trump initiated the trade war, Huawei's activities were under scrutiny by U.S. authorities, according to interviews with 10 people familiar with the Huawei probes and documents related to the investigations seen by Reuters.\n\n\"The U.S. Congress has repeatedly failed to produce any evidence to support its restrictions on Huawei products. We are compelled to take this legal action as a proper and last resort,\" Huawei Rotating Chairman Guo Ping said in a statement.\n\n\"This ban not only is unlawful, but also restricts Huawei from engaging in fair competition, ultimately harming U.S. consumers,\" he said. \"We look forward to the court's verdict.\"\n\nWhile Huawei had very little share of the U.S. market before the bill, it is the world's biggest telecoms gear maker and is seeking to be at the forefront of a global rollout of fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks and services.\n\nIn its lawsuit, Huawei said its \"equipment and services are subject to advanced security procedures, and no backdoors, implants, or other intentional security vulnerabilities have been documented in any of the more than 170 countries in the world where Huawei equipment and services are used.\"\n\nThe privately owned firm has embarked on a public relations and legal offensive as Washington lobbies allies to abandon Huawei when building 5G networks, focussing on a 2017 Chinese law requiring companies to cooperate with national intelligence work.\n\n\"The U.S. Government is sparing no effort to smear the company and mislead the public,\" Guo said in a news briefing at Huawei's headquarters in southern China.\n\nThe U.S. State Department declined comment on the lawsuit on Thursday.\n\n\"More generally,\" State Department spokesman Robert Palladino told reporters, \"the United States advocates for secure telecom networks and supply chains that are free from suppliers subject to foreign government control or undue influence which would pose risks of unauthorised access and malicious cyber activity.\"\n\nU.S. Representative Mike Conaway, a Texas Republican who has sponsored anti-Huawei legislation, called the Huawei lawsuit \"bogus.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\"NO PROOF\"\n\nThe NDAA bans the U.S. government from doing business with Huawei or compatriot peer ZTE Corp or from doing business with any company that has equipment from the two companies as a \"substantial or essential component\" of their system.\n\nIn its lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Texas, Huawei argues that the section in question is illegal because it could sharply limit the company's ability to do business in the United States despite no proof of wrongdoing.\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges that Huawei has been denied due process and that Congress, by stripping Huawei of commercial opportunities, has violated the \"separation of powers\" portion of the U.S. Constitution by doing the work of the courts.\n\nChinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said he had no information on whether China's government may also seek legal action against the U.S. law, but added Huawei's move is \"totally reasonable and totally understandable.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nUPHILL BATTLE\n\nSome legal experts said Huawei's lawsuit is likely to be dismissed because U.S. courts are reluctant to second-guess national security determinations by other branches of government.\n\nThe lawsuit \"will be an uphill battle because Congress has broad authority to protect us from perceived national security threats,\" said Franklin Turner, a government contracts lawyer at McCarter & English.",

    "text": "\n\nNick Kirmse, CTVNews.ca Staff\n\n\n\n\n\nHuawei CFO Meng Wanzhou has filed a civil claim alleging several Canadian agencies violated her constitutional rights.\n\nThe claim, which was filed in the Supreme Court of British Columbia on Friday, alleges that members of the Canadian Border Service Agency, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and the Attorney General of Canada worked together to detain Meng and collect evidence in a manner that violated her Charter rights.\n\nThe suit claims the arrest warrant filed on November 30, 2018, called for Meng\u2019s immediate arrest, based on a sworn affidavit which said arresting Meng during her brief stopover in Vancouver was \u201curgent and necessary\u201d to prevent her from leaving Canadian soil.\n\nDespite the immediacy of the situation, Meng\u2019s lawyers allege that the CBSA detained, searched and interrogated Meng under the false pretense of a \u201ccustoms or immigration examination\u201d instead of immediately arresting her and giving her the opportunity to retain legal counsel.\n\nAccording to the suit, Meng was held without cause for three hours before an RCMP constable arrived and informed her of the cause of her arrest and her right to counsel.\n\nThe suit alleges that the officer, whose affidavit was the basis of the warrant, committed an unlawful act by delaying his arrival, despite knowing when Meng\u2019s flight arrived.\n\nExperts say the filing of the suit shortly after the Canadian government announced their intention to begin the extradition process may be a stall tactic, designed to keep the government from extraditing Meng quickly.\n\n\u201cThis is going to be a long, drawn out, multi-front legal fight,\u201d Stewart Prest, political science instructor at Simon Fraser university told CTV News Channel. \u201c(The suit) may be an opportunity to draw out this process further.\u201d\n\nMeng is due back in court on Wednesday as Canada begins the process of determining whether she can be extradited.\n\nThe United States has charged Meng and Huawei with fraud over an alleged effort to deal with Iran, despite U.S. sanctions.\n\nMeng is seeking unspecified damages for the wrongful exercise of authority in public office, as well as false imprisonment, alongside costs that will be incurred in the suit.\n\nNone of the allegations in her claim have been tested in court.",

    "text": "The surprise arrest of Huawei's chief financial officer in December quickly turned the executive, Meng Wanzhou, into a central figure in a trade war between two economic superpowers.\n\nREUTERS: The surprise arrest of Huawei's chief financial officer in December quickly turned the executive, Meng Wanzhou, into a central figure in a trade war between two economic superpowers.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump told Reuters he would consider intervening in her case - a potential action he alluded to again two weeks ago - if it would help close a trade deal with China.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut U.S. probes of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd for allegedly evading U.S. sanctions on Iran were not rooted in Trump\u2019s trade aspirations. Long before Trump initiated a bitter trade war with China, Huawei activities were under scrutiny by U.S. authorities, according to interviews with ten people familiar with the Huawei probes and documents related to the investigations seen by Reuters.\n\nThe U.S. focus on Huawei intensified after years of investigation into smaller Chinese rival ZTE Corp, and relied in part on information collected from devices of company employees traveling through airports.\n\nTwo of the sources said a critical point took place in August 2017, when deputy U.S. Attorney General Rod Rosenstein - best known for his oversight of special counsel Robert Mueller's probe of Russian interference in the U.S. election \u2013 handed a lead role to Brooklyn prosecutors to pursue possible bank fraud charges against Huawei.\n\nFifteen months later, that strategy would help land Meng in a Canadian jail.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe U.S. investigations of China's top telecom companies were spurred by reports by Reuters over six years ago, detailing possible Iran sanctions violations by both ZTE and Huawei, as well as close ties between Huawei and Skycom Tech Co Ltd - a suspected front company doing business in Iran.\n\n(To read the stories, click https://reut.rs/2sRL7Ve and https://reut.rs/2sUq8RT)\n\nA spokesman for Huawei, the world's largest telecommunications equipment maker, has denied the charges in the sanctions case, and did not provide further comment to Reuters. Meng has said she is innocent of the charges. ZTE, which pleaded guilty in 2017 for illegally shipping U.S. goods to Iran, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nU.S. Justice Department spokeswoman Nicole Navas Oxman said the government pursues cases \"free of any political interference and follows the evidence and rule of law in pursuing criminal charges.\"\n\nsentifi.com Channel NewsAsia - Sentifi topic widget\n\nAIRPORT EVIDENCE GRAB\n\nOn December 1, 2018, Meng was stopped at Vancouver International Airport as she walked up the jetway after her flight, according to a lawsuit she filed on Friday accusing the Canadian government of violating her rights. Border officers examined her passport and escorted her to an area for secondary screenings.\n\nWhile there, she was instructed to surrender her two mobile phones, an iPad and a personal computer, along with their passwords, the suit alleges, and the officers viewed the devices' contents.\n\nReuters has not been able to determine what information was found on Meng\u2019s devices, but it is not the first time she and other Chinese telecom executives have turned over such property to border patrol agents.\n\nIn the years leading up to the Huawei indictment, U.S. officials had been capturing information that would influence the investigation when telecom executives passed through U.S. airports, according to a number of sources familiar with the Huawei and ZTE investigations and the Meng indictment.\n\nFor example, Meng arrived in the United States via John F. Kennedy International Airport in early 2014. The indictment says investigators found \"suggested talking points\" on one of her electronic devices, stating among other things that Huawei\u2019s relationship with Skycom was \"normal business cooperation.\"\n\nMeng had been pulled into a secondary screening at the airport that time as well, and her electronic devices were taken, according to one person familiar with the stop. After a couple of hours, the devices were returned and she was freed to go, the person said.\n\nAnother border search, this time on September 12, 2014, of executives from rival ZTE also supported U.S. investigators long-held suspicions of how Huawei might have been doing illicit business in countries subject to U.S. sanctions, one of the sources told Reuters.\n\nZTE's CFO at the time was stopped at Boston's Logan Airport after flying in from London with an assistant, the person said.\n\nThe assistant was carrying a Lenovo laptop containing a confidential ZTE document, dated August 25, 2011 and signed by four top executives, about the need to establish front companies to supply U.S. procured items needed for projects in embargoed countries.\n\nThe airport stop provided key evidence against ZTE in its legal battle with the United States, according to U.S. officials. But it also identified a company as \"F7\" and how it used a front company to serve as its agent for contracts in sanctioned countries. F7 was Huawei, according to the individuals familiar with the ZTE and Huawei investigations.\n\nThe document was posted on the U.S. Commerce Department website in March 2016 when ZTE was placed on a list of companies that were restricted from buying parts and components from U.S. suppliers. Shortly after the public posting, the New York Times reported that the description of F7 offered by ZTE matched Huawei.\n\nA month later, the Commerce Department sent a subpoena to Huawei in the United States demanding information on the company's exporting American technology to Iran, according to a court document and one of the people familiar with the Huawei probe.\n\nFROM ZTE TO HUAWEI\n\nWith the case against ZTE wrapping up, more than a dozen people from Departments of Treasury, Commerce, Homeland Security and Justice, gathered in Washington on February 14, 2017 and talked about how they were moving forward against Huawei, according to a person familiar with matter.\n\nBrooklyn prosecutors discussed the relationship between Huawei and HSBC, a bank that was required to cooperate with U.S. prosecutors in any investigation until the end of 2017 for violating U.S. anti-money laundering and sanctions laws, the person added.\n\nIn late 2016, HSBC began to conduct an internal bank probe of Huawei. In the weeks and months following the meeting, HSBC helped authorities obtain evidence of links between Skycom and Huawei, documents reviewed by Reuters show. The probe found Meng met in 2013 with a HSBC banker. She later gave him a copy of the PowerPoint presentation, which the U.S. indictment says misrepresented Huawei\u2019s control of Skycom.\n\nHSBC told Reuters that it provided information in response to demands from the Justice Department.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney's office in Washington, D.C., meanwhile, pursued a more traditional export control investigation against Huawei, which included the accusations of attempted illegal shipments of computers to Iran disclosed in the Reuters 2012 story.\n\nA grand jury subpoena was issued to the U.S subsidiary of the company in April 2017, the first clear sign to Huawei that the probe had turned criminal.\n\nArmed with that knowledge, the company moved U.S.-based Chinese employees who knew about its Iranian dealings out of the country and otherwise concealed and destroyed evidence, the prosecutors allege. Meng and other Huawei executives also began to avoid travel to the United States, prosecutors say.\n\nIn the late summer of 2017, according to two of the sources close to the Huawei investigation, Rosenstein chose Brooklyn as the venue to file charges and the Washington U.S. Attorney's office dropped out of the case. Brooklyn was already working with a money laundering unit at the Justice Department. The national security division also merged with the Brooklyn prosecution team.\n\nLegal experts said since most evidence of any illegal U.S. goods in Iran presumably existed outside the jurisdiction of U.S. authorities, the bank fraud route presented a potentially quicker path to indictment. They added that bank fraud charges are more likely to lead to arrest by other countries for extradition to the United States than export controls or sanctions violations, and have a longer statute of limitations.\n\nMeng and the company were charged with bank and wire fraud. The PowerPoint presentation\u2019s \u201cnumerous misrepresentations\u201d were central to the charges brought against Meng herself, the indictment shows.\n\nTwelve months after Brooklyn got the case, prosecutors secretly obtained a warrant for Meng's arrest.\n\nLess than four months later they learned she was stopping in Vancouver en route to Mexico on December 1, and asked the Canadians to detain her at the airport.\n\n(Editing by Chris Sanders and Edward Tobin)",

Kovrig also holds Hungarian citizenship.\n\nCanada arrested Meng on Dec. 1 as she was changing planes in Vancouver, at the request of the United States. In late January the US Justice Department charged Meng and Huawei with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran.\n\nShe is free on bail and denies the charges against her.\n\nSeparately, Huawei plans to announce a lawsuit against the US government on Thursday on grounds related to a defense bill, a source with knowledge of the matter said.\n\n- Reuters\n\n",

    "text": "Huawei sues US Government over 'unconstitutional' product ban as trade war heats up\n\nPosted\n\nChinese telecoms giant Huawei Technologies is suing the US Government over the \"unconstitutional\" ban of its products, ratcheting up its fight against a government bent on closing it out of global markets.\n\nKey points: It is the latest confrontation between both countries embroiled in a trade war\n\nHuawei wants to be the at the forefront of 5G mobile networks and services\n\nHuawei says similar legal action against the Australian Government is \"not a priority\"\n\nHuawei said it had filed a complaint at a federal court in Texas challenging Section 889 of the National Defence Authorisation Act (NDAA) \u2014 signed into law by US President Donald Trump in August \u2014 which bars federal agencies and their contractors from procuring its equipment and services.\n\nThe lawsuit marks the latest confrontation between China and the US, which spent most of 2018 slapping import tariffs on billions of dollars worth of each other's goods.\n\nThe year ended with the arrest of Huawei's chief financial officer (CFO) in Canada at the request of the US and to the consternation of China.\n\nLong before Mr Trump initiated the trade war, Huawei's activities were under scrutiny by US authorities, according to interviews with 10 people familiar with the Huawei probes and documents related to the investigations seen by Reuters.\n\nHuawei rotating chairman Guo Ping said in a statement: \"The US Congress has repeatedly failed to produce any evidence to support its restrictions on Huawei products\".\n\n\"We are compelled to take this legal action as a proper and last resort.\n\n\"This ban not only is unlawful, but also restricts Huawei from engaging in fair competition, ultimately harming US consumers. We look forward to the court's verdict.\"\n\nWhile Huawei had very little share of the US market before the bill, it is the world's biggest telecoms gear-maker and is seeking to be at the forefront of a global rollout of fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks and services.\n\nIn its lawsuit, Huawei said its \"equipment and services are subject to advanced security procedures, and no backdoors, implants or other intentional security vulnerabilities have been documented in any of the more-than-170 countries in the world where Huawei equipment and services are used\".\n\nThe privately owned firm embarked on a public relations and legal offensive as Washington lobbied allies to abandon Huawei when building 5G networks, centring on a 2017 Chinese law requiring companies to cooperate with national intelligence work.\n\n\"The US Government is sparing no effort to smear the company and mislead the public,\" said Mr Guo in a news briefing at Huawei's headquarters in southern China.\n\nMeanwhile, as tensions escalate between Australia and Huawei, a spokesperson for the firm said it was not a priority for the company to commence similar legal action against Australia.\n\nThey said: \"Whilst we have our differences with the Federal Government, we would still rather work cooperatively to deliver world-leading technology to Australians\".\n\n\"A legal challenge is not a priority at this moment.\n\n\"Huawei Australia is a $650 million business and our 700 employees continue to serve half the Australian population with safe and secure technology,\" they added.\n\nExperts say lawsuit is likely to be dismissed\n\nThe NDAA bans the US Government from doing business with Huawei and compatriot peer ZTE Corp, or from doing business with any company that has equipment from the two firms as a \"substantial or essential component\" of their system.\n\nIn its lawsuit, Huawei argues that the section in question is illegal because it could sharply limit the company's ability to do business in the US despite no proof of wrongdoing.\n\nThe lawsuit also alleged that Huawei had been denied due process and that Congress, by stripping Huawei of commercial opportunities, violated the \"separation of powers\" portion of the constitution by doing the work of the courts.\n\nSome legal experts, however, said Huawei's lawsuit was likely to be dismissed because US courts were reluctant to second-guess national security determinations by other branches of government.\n\nThe lawsuit \"will be an uphill battle because Congress has broad authority to protect us from perceived national security threats\", said Franklin Turner, a government contracts lawyer at McCarter & English.\n\nThe legal action compared with a more restrained response in December emphasising \"trust in justice\" after the arrest of CFO Meng Wanzhou.\n\nHuawei founder Ren Zhengfei later said Ms Meng's arrest was politically motivated and \"not acceptable\".\n\nMs Meng \u2014 Mr Ren's daughter \u2014 is accused by the US of bank and wire fraud related to breaches of trade sanctions against Iran.\n\nCanada approved extradition proceedings on March 1 this year, but Ms Meng has since sued Canada's Government for procedural wrongs in her arrest. The next court hearing is set for May 8.\n\nReuters\n\nTopics: computers-and-technology, internet-technology, security-intelligence, world-politics, courts-and-trials, law-crime-and-justice, china, asia, united-kingdom, united-states",

    "text": "Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou wasn't a particularly well-known name in the West \u2014 especially outside of tech circles \u2014 until only several months back. After being detained at a Canadian airport on her way to Mexico on December 1, she ended up at the center of a diplomatic scandal, with her name on the lips of many a statesman.\n\nThe 47-year-old daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei has been with the company since its startup days in the 90s and held a variety of positions, with the CFO role being the crown of her career that began with the China Construction Bank in '92, immediately following her graduation. She quit that job to join Huawei as a secretary after a year, hence supporting her father's endeavor from its inception. While still in her 20s, Ms. Meng took a hiatus and earned a master's degree in accounting from the Huazhong University of Science and Technology in '97, then returned to Huawei in '98 and steadily climbed the ranks ever since.\n\nWhen exactly did she earn the current CFO role is unclear; Huawei only disclosed the names of its C-suite executives in 2011 and Ms. Meng was already entrusted with that position back then. Almost exactly one year ago to date, the industry veteran and mother of four was appointed as one of the four chairpeople of Huawei's board. Whether by work history, legacy, or family name, Ms. Meng is a top Huawei official and one of the most important individuals at the Shenzen-based technology juggernaut.\n\nAnd while details of her two-decade rise to the top level of the company's hierarchy remain scarce, recent developments shed much light on her latest role at Huawei - none of it good.\n\nThe story of how Ms. Meng ended up facing decades in prison is a spotty one, especially after she won a publication ban in Canada shortly following her early December arrest, thus limiting the media's ability to discover and report on the details of her case. Still, here's what's known so far:\n\nIf it looks like a front and acts like a front...\n\nThe United States Department of Justice that's presently trying (and succeeding, so far) to extradite Ms. Meng from Canada alleges she has personally forged and maintained secretive relationships with two former companies with Middle Eastern operations. Through those ties, the executive sought to violate the Commerce Department's trade sanctions imposed on Iran. Whether or not she succeeded has yet to be clarified in the court of law but not only is the answer to that question a resounding \"yes\" if you ask Washington officials but the conspiracy to break federal regulations is by itself also a felony.\n\nWhat's more, some of the actions that kept the full extent of Huawei's relationships with those company hidden to outside eyes required an illegal banking scheme, hence constituting fraud.\n\nThe companies in question are Hong Kong-based Skycom Tech Co Ltd that operated a Tehran affiliate, as well as Canicula Holdings Ltd from Mauritius, East Africa. The money exchanged between the duo and Huawei was depicted as regular business activity, yet American prosecutors believe the two firms operated as de facto satellites of the Chinese conglomerate. While Canicula's involvement has yet to be officially confirmed and is mainly known due to investigative reports from Reuters, Skycom has not only been mentioned by the DOJ but was even named as one of the defendants in a 13-count federal indictment unsealed in late January, with government officials explicitly identifying it as a Huawei subsidiary.\n\nTo this date, Huawei denies an affiliate relationship with Skycom, so while the federal prosecution is proceeding with its indictment, the Chinese company is attempting to argue the very basic details of the case, which some administration officials previously described as a bizarre strategy that cannot work because virtually all relevant evidence is against it. Media reports dating back as far as 2012 clearly identify it as such and provide evidence that Ms. Meng was sitting on its board of directors.\n\nHow one of the company's top executives and the daughter of its founder would end up in the ranks of a regular associate and pulling double duty is something Huawei never even attempted to explain.\n\nThe fraud meant to keep Huawei's relationship with Skycom a secret started no later than 2007 when the firm organized an apparent sale of its stake in Skycom, the original basis of affiliate claims, yet controlled the firm that purchased it through a complicated web of corporate relationships which were only uncovered years later as investigators were following the money. Ms. Meng personally lied to an official of one of the company's banking partners as part of a presentation she gave in 2013, the DOJ's lawsuit alleges.\n\nAmerican banks were also on the receiving end of those lies, having cleared tens of millions of dollars worth of transactions between Huawei and Skycom's Iranian arm while relying on that false representation of the relationship between the two. Had they knowingly processed the payments while being aware of the true nature of Huawei's Skycom ties, those banks would be facing major fines and other penalties.\n\nIn conclusion, Ms. Meng is accused of bank fraud, wire fraud, and conspiracies to commit both.\n\nOn racism, egoism, and retaliatory death sentences\n\nHaving Donald Trump as your leader means many things for any entity, let alone the nation with the most powerful military and economy in the world, yet it doesn't exactly guarantee sensitive handling of diplomatic issues, to say the least. After Canadian authorities arrested Ms. Meng on the DOJ's request, reports emerged that the White House was purposefully kept in the dark regarding the operation preceding the development, with the main government concern being those activities would affect trade talks between the U.S. and China.\n\nWhy President Trump wasn't proactively given that intelligence beforehand was illustrated what happened after the deed was done; less than two weeks following Ms. Meng's arrest, he proudly declared he's prepared to leverage her during the negotiations in question, assuming he finds a way to do so. That statement was a true jackpot for China - it doesn't matter that a U.S. President can't feasibly intervene in a court proceeding of any kind, let alone such a high-profile one, and not only would any attempt to do so be frivolous but would likely end in impeachment; the very fact Trump falsely suggested he has the ability to do so provided China with ammo that it used in mere minutes.\n\nIt was precisely that statement that led to ridiculous claims about Ms. Meng being a victim of racism and politics, and it came at the worst possible time, just as China started retaliating by arresting Canadian citizens, starting with former diplomat Michael Kovrig who was in the country doing work for the International Crisis Group, and continuing with entrepreneur Michael Spavor, the founder of a local company offering tourist trips to North Korea. Teacher Sarah McIver was also taken into custody by mid-December but was later returned to Canada.\n\nAs Mr. Kovrig is technically on leave from Global Affairs Canada, PM Justin Trudeau accused China of violating diplomatic immunity which should still apply in his case. He also had a grown-up talk with Trump in early January, whereafter the head of the U.S. confirmed Washington must respect judicial independence and not attempt meddling in the case.\n\nTwo weeks later, Robert Schellenberg, a Canadian sentenced to 15 years in a Chinese prison for drug smuggling, is surprisingly granted a retrial following his appeal. Following hasty proceedings, he's sentenced to death in mid-January, which prompted yet another diplomatic incident.\n\nCanada's envoy to China, John McCallum, was fired in late January after saying he believes Ms. Meng's legal argument against her extradition to the U.S. is \"quite strong,\" later adding it would be \"great for Canada\" if Washington lets the whole thing go.\n\nA point of no return\n\nMs. Meng already failed in arguing her extradition to the U.S. would be illegal and had sued the Canadian government for the treament she received. The executive held permanent residency in Canada between 2001 and 2009, owns several multi-million-dollar homes in the area together with her family, and has been regularly visiting Vancouver for years. Some of her homes were put up as collateral for her bail amounting to the equivalent of $7.5 million. Besides local ties, her attorneys cited health issues as another reason why she can not continue being incarcerated.\n\nThe picture they painted is that of a thyroid cancer survivor who suffers from sleep apnea, severe hypertension, and needs daily access to specialized foods and drugs. As for the accusations against her, the legal team assembled in Vancouver is presently shifting the blame to Huawei China's legal team and not the finance unit led by Ms. Meng.\n\nWhat happens now is anyone's guess but this is certainly a point of no return; China is destroying its diplomatic relationships by openly threatening Canada, Canada is on the verge of dropping Huawei's 5G technology, Huawei risks losing who some describe as its heir apparent as the aforementioned charges could amount to up to 30 years in federal prison for Ms. Meng, Ms. Meng stands to lose what she surely perceives as everything, and the U.S. is entering uncharted territory when it comes to holding Chinese firms accountable for disrespecting stateside and international laws.\n\nIn the meantime, Huawei sued the U.S. over its claims of national security concerns which prompted it to block the majority of the firm's business on its territory, and the next hearing in Ms. Meng's extradition trial has been scheduled for May 8 as her lawyers made abuse claims earlier this month, meaning she'll lose at least half a year in total while fighting the charges laid out against her.\n\nAfter four months' worth of arguments, threats, arrests, firings, lawsuits, and one death sentence, it's scary to think that whatever follows is bound to be even uglier.",

    "text": "Chinese FM Lodges Protest Over Huawei CFO Extradition to US, Slams Canada\n\nSputnik News\n\n05:30 02.03.2019(updated 08:52 02.03.2019)\n\nBEIJING/MOSCOW (Sputnik)- The Canadian Department of Justice has said that Ottawa had decided to grant authorisation to proceed with the extradition process in Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou's case.\n\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry said Saturday that Beijing expressed opposition to Canada's decision on Meng Wanzhou extradition to the United States.\n\n\"The Chinese side has expressed its extreme discontent and decisive protest to the Canadian side due to its persistent promotion of the so-called judicial procedures on the extradition of Ms Meng Wanzhou. Beijing has already lodged stern representations [with Ottawa]\", the ministry's spokesman, Lu Kang, said in a statement.\n\nChina's high-tech giant Huawei said a statement, issued by its lawyers on 2 March, that Canada's decision to initiate the extradition of the company's Chief Financial Officer, Meng Wanzhou, to the United States was disappointing.\n\n\"The allegations of the US side are politically-motivated. The US president [Donald Trump] has repeatedly said that if the case of Ms Meng Wanzhou helps reach a [trade] deal between the United States and China, he will intervene in this case. Despite that, the Canadian Justice Department still decided to issue the relevant order. We are very disappointed by these actions\", the company said in a statement.\n\nThe telecoms giant noted that Meng's actions, considered as offences by the United States, were not offensive under the Canadian law. Thus, Canada's authorisation of extradition procedures violates the dual criminality principle \u2013 the main requirement for extradition, under which a person can be handed over for trial by one state to another if similar laws, which have been violated by the suspect, exist in both countries, according to Huawei.\n\n\"Ms Meng Wanzhou did nothing illegal. The United States abused judicial procedures by initiating criminal procedures and asking for her extradition\", the company noted.\n\nThe British Columbia Supreme Court has scheduled an appearance date for 6 March to confirm the extradition authorisation and to set the date for the extradition hearing.\n\nMeng, the daughter of the founder of Chinese telecoms giant, was arrested in Vancouver on 1 December 2018 at the United States' request, reportedly for failing to comply with US sanctions against Iran. The arrest was decried by Beijing, which demanded that Canadian authorities immediately release the Chinese national.\n\nChinese-Canadian relations were further strained following the detention of two Canadian citizens, former diplomat Michael Kovrig and businessman Michael Spavor, in China shortly after Meng's arrest. While the detentions have been widely regarded as Beijing's retaliation for the arrest of the Huawei executive, Chinese authorities have denied the allegations, insisting that the two men posed a threat to national security.\n\n\u00a9 Sputnik\n\nNEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address\n\n\n\n\n\n",
