    "text": "Image: HP\n\nEven though the government shutdown ended more than a month and a half ago, we\u2019re still feeling its effects. That\u2019s because, despite HP issuing an expansion for a battery recall back in January, the notice wasn\u2019t posted to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) website until earlier this week due to the shutdown.\n\nHP\u2019s latest battery woes actually stem back to a recall covering 50,000 affected units first issued in January 2018, which was then expanded earlier this year to include another 78,500 or so at-risk systems and battery accessories. Meanwhile, on the most recent recall alert posted by the CPSC on March 12th, a note at the top of the CPSC website says \u201cThis recall expansion was previously announced independently on January 17, 2019 by the firm due to US government furlough.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHP\u2019s laptop battery recall primarily affects a number of the company\u2019s commercial notebooks including various HP ProBooks and HP ZBook workstations, though there are a few consumer laptops mixed in there such as the 11-inch HP Pavilion x360 and HP Envy m6. Some recalled batteries were also sold as accessories or replacement batteries for existing laptops for systems such as the HP Envy 15 and assorted HP Mobile Thin Clients.\n\nSo far, the CPSC says HP has received eight new reports of these faulty battery overheating, melting, and charring, with one instance of a recalled battery causing minor injury.\n\nConsumers with laptop batteries who think they might be subject to recall are asked to go to this website and download HP\u2019s Battery Validation tool to check if their battery needs to be replaced, as some of the systems affected by the recall have internal batteries that are not user replaceable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHP says it is also trying to proactively notify customers, and if a battery is determined to be part of the recall, HP says owners should stop using the system immediately and put the system in Battery Safety Mode via HP\u2019s BIOS update. From there HP will provide free battery replacement for affected units.\n\nScreenshot: HP\n\nTo see a full list of recalled products and accessory batteries, check out the list above or visit HP\u2019s recall page here. Hopefully the next time a big recall pops up, instead of having workers sitting on their hands caused by political posturing, the government can make sure its workers are available to help get the word out.\n\n",

    "title": "Boeing\u2019s fixes to 737 MAX software delayed by government shutdown, report claims",
    "description": "Change to software due \"by April,\" says Boeing\u2014but could it have come sooner?",
    "text": "Update: President Donald Trump announced Wednesday afternoon that the Federal Aviation Administration will order all 737 MAX 8 and 737 MAX 9 planes to be grounded.\n\n\"We\u2019re going to be issuing an emergency order of prohibition to ground all flights of the 737 Max 8 and the 737 Max 9 and planes associated with that line,\" Trump said. \"Pilots have been notified, airlines have been all notified. Airlines are agreeing with this. The safety of the American people and all people is our paramount concern.\"\n\nFaced with widespread bans on the aircraft, Boeing has recommended the 737 MAX be grounded as well. \"We are supporting this proactive step out of an abundance of caution,\" Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said in a statement. \"Safety is a core value at Boeing for as long as we have been building airplanes; and it always will be. There is no greater priority for our company and our industry. We are doing everything we can to understand the cause of the accidents in partnership with the investigators, deploy safety enhancements and help ensure this does not happen again.\"\n\nOriginal story: Despite two crashes within six months, a growing number of grounding orders worldwide for the Boeing 737 MAX, and a number of recent complaints from US pilots over problems with the aircraft's automatic trim controls, the Federal Aviation Administration continues to allow the 737 MAX to fly. \"The United States Federal Aviation Administration is not mandating any further action at this time, and based on the information currently available, we do not have any basis to issue new guidance to operators,\" a Boeing spokesperson said in a March 12 statement.\n\nBut government inaction may have been at least partially to blame for the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX on March 10\u2014the US government shutdown reportedly pushed back a fix to the aircraft's software for more than a month.\n\nOn March 11, Boeing announced that the company \"has been developing a flight control software enhancement for the 737 MAX, designed to make an already safe aircraft even safer.\" The shutdown of non-essential operations at the FAA caused work on the fix to be suspended for five weeks, according to unnamed US officials cited by the Wall Street Journal. The fix is expected to be mandated for installation by the FAA by the end of April.\n\nThe update seeks to correct what may have been the root cause of the crash of Lion Air Flight 610 in Indonesia last October\u2014the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System's (MCAS') reliance on a single sensor to determine whether the aircraft is entering a stall. But according to a WSJ report, that fix was delayed because the FAA shutdown interrupted the approval process.\n\n\"We don\u2019t have any comment on claims in the WSJ\u2019s story,\" a Boeing spokesperson told Ars.\n\nA stall occurs when an aircraft's angle of attack (AOA)\u2014the relative angle of the aircraft's wing surfaces to the flow of air across them\u2014reaches the point where the wing can no longer generate enough lift to sustain flight. Usually, this happens in a climb with insufficient air speed. Automatic control systems such as MCAS try to solve this problem by pushing the nose of the aircraft down\u2014putting the aircraft into a descent and increasing airspeed and relative airflow across the wings. MCAS relies on an AOA sensor to determine whether this is required. If the AOA sensor is faulty, it could create a false signal of a stall\u2014which is what happened in the case of Lion Air Flight 610 and may have been the issue with the Ethiopian Airlines flight.\n\nThe MCAS software update includes a new \"enhanced flight control law,\" a Boeing spokesperson said, which \"incorporates [AOA] inputs, limits stabilizer trim commands in response to an erroneous angle of attack reading, and provides a limit to the stabilizer command in order to retain elevator authority.\"\n\nIn other words, it uses multiple sensor inputs to determine whether adjustments to the flight controls are necessary, giving the pilot direct control over the tail control surfaces to override any automatic adjustments. Currently, the pilot would have to entirely disable automatic stabilizer trim to counteract \"stabilizer trim runaway\" in the event of a sensor error.\n\nGo home, 737 MAX\u2026\n\nOn March 13, the European Union's civil aviation authorities joined China, Australia, Singapore, Ethiopia, Malaysia, the United Kingdom, and a number of Latin American air carriers in grounding Boeing 737 MAX aircraft after the crash of the Ethiopian Airlines flight just after take-off on March 10. As the EU imposed its grounding, a number of 737 MAX aircraft were forced to turn around in flight because they were no longer considered airworthy at their destinations.\n\nThis poor guy got turned around. pic.twitter.com/M7MZ5bK32n \u2014 Outdated Ineffective Wall (@darthbender) March 12, 2019\n\nToday, Canada's transportation minister announced a grounding of all 737 MAX aircraft in Canada and a ban on the incursion of 737 MAX aircraft from other countries into Canadian airspace. The decision, Minister Marc Garneau said, was based on new satellite tracking data reviewed by Canadian aviation authorities.\n\nMeanwhile, Boeing continues to stand behind the safety of the aircraft. \"We understand that regulatory agencies and customers have made decisions that they believe are most appropriate for their home markets,\" a Boeing spokesperson said. \"We\u2019ll continue to engage with them to ensure they have the information needed to have confidence in operating their fleets.\"\n\nThose concerns may not be addressed until the software patch for MCAS is pushed out.",

    "title": "Airbnb agrees to acquire last-minute hotel-booking app HotelTonight",
    "description": "Airbnb to purchase HotelTonight, a hotel-booking app last valued at $463 million.",
    "text": "As Airbnb gears up for its big leap into the public markets, it\u2019s expanding its accommodations platform to include more than just treehouses and quirky homes.\n\nToday, the company has confirmed its intent to acquire HotelTonight, the developer of a hotel-booking application that lets travelers arrange last-minute accommodations. The deal was previously reported by The Wall Street Journal, which wrote in January that negotiations for the transaction had \u201cgone cold.\u201d\n\nAirbnb is expected to complete an initial public offering as soon as this year, though co-founder and chief executive officer Brian Chesky has refrained from revealing a specific timeline. Like Uber, which plans to become the ultimate transportation company, Airbnb\u2019s long-term ambition is to build an end-to-end travel platform complete with home sharing, hotel booking, business travel arrangements, experiences and more.\n\nAirbnb declined to disclose terms of its HotelTonight acquisition. Once the deal is complete, the HotelTonight app and website will continue to operate independently, with co-founder and CEO Sam Shank reporting to Airbnb\u2019s president of homes, Greg Greeley.\n\n\u201cWe started HotelTonight because we knew people wanted a better way to book an amazing hotel room on-demand, and we are excited to join forces with Airbnb to bring this service to guests around the world,\u201d Shank said in a statement. \u201cTogether, HotelTonight and Airbnb can give guests more choices and the world\u2019s best boutique and independent hotels a genuine partner to connect them with those guests.\u201d\n\nFounded in 2010, San Francisco-based HotelTonight garnered a valuation of $463 million with a $37 million Series E funding in 2017, according to PitchBook. In total, the startup has raised $131 million in venture capital funding from Accel and Battery Ventures, which have participated in nearly every funding round for HotelTonight. Other early investors include Forerunner Ventures and First Round Capital.\n\n[gallery ids=\"1794066,1794068,1794069\"]\n\nAirbnb, for its part, was valued at $31 billion in 2017, with a $1 billion round. In January, Airbnb said it was profitable for the second consecutive year on an EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) basis.\n\nHotelTonight offers discounts at hotels in the Americas, Europe and Australia. The company partners with hotels to offer un-sold rooms, catering to business travelers or those looking to make last-minute arrangements. The deal will make it easier for Airbnb users to book hotels without planning weeks or months in advance and will help Airbnb expand its community beyond short-term rental hosts and guests.\n\nAirbnb introduced boutique hotels to its platform in early 2018 and has boasted its quick growth. In 2018, the business said it more than doubled the number of boutique hotels, bed and breakfasts, hostels and resorts available. Airbnb\u2019s business travel unit, Airbnb for Work, also had quick success. Launched in 2014, it now accounts for 15 percent of bookings. In total, Airbnb offers some 5 million places to stay in 191 countries.\n\nAirbnb is kicking off 2019 with an acquisitive streak. In January, the company acquired Danish startup Gaest, a provider of a marketplace-style platform for people to post and book venues for meetings and other work-related events. The company again declined to pinpoint the price, though given Gaest had raised just $3.5 million in equity funding, the deal pales in comparison to Airbnb\u2019s HotelTonight acquisition.\n\n2019 is stacking up to be a particularly busy year for unicorn IPOs, some of which were likely delayed by a weeks-long government shutdown at the start of the year. Lyft, which recently unveiled its S-1, is poised to be the first billion-dollar company to exit to the stock markets, followed by Uber, Slack and Pinterest. Will Airbnb nudge its way into that lineup? We\u2019ll see.",

    "text": "Since Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was elected to Congress, she's brought a refreshing and powerfully passionate energy to Washington, DC.\n\nWhen she isn't mastering the art of the Twitter takedown, sharing her social media skills with fellow Democrats, or answering interview questions as candidly as possible, the 29-year-old is making insightful speeches that effectively communicate her personal beliefs and challenge the American people to rethink our power structures and national priorities.\n\nWhether she's at a protest or on the House floor, Ocasio-Cortez never shies away from expressing her opinions, no matter how bold. She delivers her messages calmly and succinctly, and though she's only been on the job for a few months, she's already made several memorable \u2014 and quotable \u2014 speeches.\n\nFrom thanking her supporters on the night she was elected to her stirring defense of the Green New Deal, here are seven Ocasio-Cortez speeches so good you'll want to binge watch them whenever you need to be inspired.\n\n1. Her victory speech\n\nThe 29-year-old representing New York's 14th Congressional District became the youngest woman to ever be elected to Congress, and after she was elected in November 2018, she gave an impassioned victory speech.\n\nOcasio-Cortez recalled the many obstacles she overcame throughout her life to get to that podium and thanked her supporters, encouraging them and promising she would fight to change the world for the better.\n\n2. The first speech she made on the House floor\n\nDuring President Trump's government shutdown, which lasted 35 days \u2014 the longest in America's history \u2014 Ocasio-Cortez made her first speech on the House floor.\n\n\"The truth of this shutdown is that it's actually not about a wall, it is not about the border, and it is certainly not about the well-being of everyday Americans. The truth is, this shutdown is about the erosion of American democracy and the subversion of our most basic governmental norms,\" she said during her time at the mic.\n\nOcasio-Cortez's speech reportedly broke a C-SPAN streaming record on Twitter by racking up 1.16 million views in a little over 12 hours \u2014 the most views a video of any member of the House has ever received. Quite the debut, AOC.\n\n3. Her comments at the 2019 Women's March\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at the Women's March in New York: \"Justice is about making sure that being polite is not the same thing as being quiet. In fact, often times, the most righteous thing you can do is shake the table.\" https://t.co/knzLXDTwND pic.twitter.com/oXcsyrGb2S \u2014 CNN (@CNN) January 19, 2019\n\nOcasio-Cortez attended the 2019 Women's March in New York City wearing her iconic red lipstick and gold hoop earrings, where she made a powerful speech about justice, equality, and the environment.\n\n\"Justice is about making sure that being polite is not the same thing as being quiet. In fact, often times, the most righteous thing you can do is shake the table,\" she poetically preached to an enthusiastic audience.\n\n4. When she took on Big Pharma\n\nAOC has made several speeches before House committees, but she drew a lot of attention in February when she asked in-depth questions about Big Pharma and public investment return on the development of drugs.\n\n5. The time she exposed America's broken campaign finance system\n\nAnother noteworthy speech took place when Ocasio-Cortez played a five-minute, lightning round \"Corruption Game\" with members of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, who held a hearing about H.R. 1., known as For the People Act of 2019.\n\n\"I'll be the bad guy,\" Ocasio-Cortez said, before proceeding to ask a series of questions that successfully exposed how incredibly problematic and \"fundamentally broken\" America's campaign finance system is.\n\nAt one point, she asked if she and all other Americans are being held to a higher ethical standard than the president, to which Walter Shaub, Campaign Legal Center's senior director of ethics, replied, \"That's right...\"\n\n6. Her hopeful inaugural address\n\nOcasio-Cortez returned home to the Bronx to deliver a nearly 20-minute inaugural address in February. In the hopeful speech she outlined her political agenda, highlighting topics like immigration, Amazon, her Green New Deal, and more.\n\n7. Her defense of the Green New Deal\n\nWatch every second of this... @AOC is so incredibly spot on. pic.twitter.com/ESP4dC5TTo \u2014 Brian Tyler Cohen (@briantylercohen) March 27, 2019\n\nAOC recently defended the Green New Deal to the Senate after the plan was rejected by a vote of of 57-0. In response to concern that the deal is \"elitist,\" Ocasio-Cortez outlined why a general concern over climate and environment impacts each and every person on this planet.\n\n\"This is not an elitist issue, this is a quality of life issue,\" the Congresswoman said. \"You want to tell people that their concern and their desire for clean air and clean water is elitist? Tell that to the kids in the south Bronx, which are suffering from the highest rates of childhood asthma in the country.\"\n\n\"Tell that to the families in Flint whose kids have their blood ascending in lead levels, their brains are damaged for the rest of their lives. Call them elitist.\"\n\nHow one even attempts to recover after being hit with a such a high caliber response is beyond me. Following the speech, as the video above made the rounds online, AOC received a whole lot of Twitter praise.\n\nOcasio-Cortez has been captivating rooms long before she joined Congress \u2014 as you can see by this 2011 speech she made at Boston University \u2014 and she's an expert at reaching wide audiences on Twitter and Instagram Live. We have no doubt she'll deliver plenty more meaningful, moving messages during her time in Congress and beyond. We eagerly await future speeches, and will continue to update this article with the best of the best.",

    "description": "The Federal Aviation Administration and an inspector general will signal changes to aviation safety oversight in the wake of two fatal Boeing 737 MAX 8 crashes, according to prepared testimony obtained by CNN for a highly anticipated congressional hearing.",
    "text": "(CNN) The Federal Aviation Administration and an inspector general will signal changes to aviation safety oversight in the wake of two fatal Boeing 737 MAX 8 crashes, according to prepared testimony obtained by CNN for a highly anticipated congressional hearing.\n\nDan Elwell, the acting FAA administrator, will tell members of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation's Subcommittee on Aviation and Space Wednesday afternoon that the agency's \"oversight approach needs to evolve,\" although he will say the processes used to certify the 737 MAX were \"extensive, well-established, and have consistently produced safe aircraft designs for decades.\"\n\nHe will defend the FAA's initial decision not to ground the 737 MAX fleet, even as other regulators worldwide did so, saying the agency was not seeing \"systemic performance issues\" with the plane but that it acted three days later when it received \"new information\" from investigators.\n\nElwell will testify alongside Transportation Department Inspector General Calvin Scovel, an agency watchdog, and National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Robert Sumwalt, whose independent federal board investigates incidents and makes recommendations to the FAA and others with regulatory authority. The FAA is part of the Transportation Department.\n\nThe inspector general said changes are coming this summer to a program that allows aircraft manufacturers to sign off on their own work in the FAA's name.\n\n\"By July 2019, FAA plans to introduce a new process that represents a significant change in its oversight approach,\" Scovel's testimony reads. \"For example, FAA's new process will include identifying system elements and developing new evaluation criteria.\"\n\nA spokesman for the FAA declined to comment on or provide details about the changes.\n\nElwell's testimony describes the program -- Organization Designation Authorization -- as \"critical to the success and effectiveness of the certification process\" and mandated by Congress to help manage the FAA's hefty and complex workload.\n\nScovel's testimony summarizes inspector general concerns with the program dating to 2011.\n\n\"Our work over the years on the ODA program has identified management weaknesses with a number of FAA's oversight processes,\" Scovel's testimony reads. \"To its credit, the Agency has taken action to improve its oversight in response to our recommendations.\"\n\nScovel confirms the inspector general's office is probing the 737 MAX certification in response to multiple requests, and Sumwalt's testimony says the NTSB is reviewing \"the US design certification process to ensure any deficiencies are captured and addressed.\"\n\nBoeing officials will be \"carefully monitoring\" the hearing from DC-area offices in Arlington, Virginia.\n\n\"Boeing continues to support the ongoing accident investigations, and is working with the authorities to evaluate new information as it becomes available,\" the company said in a statement. \"Safety is our top priority when we design, build, deliver and maintain Boeing aircraft. Boeing has worked with the FAA, DOT, NTSB, pilots and airline customers as well as other aviation community partners for decades to make flying the world's safest mode of transportation.\"\n\nThe witnesses reveal little about the ongoing investigations of the October Lion Air crash and the Ethiopian Airlines crash earlier this month, which are being conducted by other countries' safety boards with assistance from the NTSB and Boeing. The FAA called the two incidents similar when it grounded the 737 MAX fleet, and investigators are probing a stabilization system that appears to have driven the nose of the Lion Air plane down while the pilots tried repeatedly to pull the plane up.\n\nElwell's testimony reveals that Boeing submitted a proposal to change the system's software to the FAA on January 21, long before the Ethiopian crash and while the FAA and other government agencies were largely closed because of a funding impasse between Congress and the White House. Elwell told reporters earlier this month that the software change had not been delayed by the shutdown.\n\nHe also said the 737 MAX certification involved 297 flight tests, including flights that assessed the stabilization system, the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System.\n\nThe shutdown did impact the NTSB's work investigating the Lion Air crash, Sumwalt reveals. He notes that investigators were furloughed due to the government shutdown but \"NTSB recalled four investigators from furlough ... to assist with proper transcription\" of the cockpit voice recorder, which was recovered in mid-January.",

    "title": "HP recalls more laptops for 'fire and burn hazards' - CNET",
    "description": "We didn't know earlier because of the government shutdown.",
    "text": "Josh Miller/CNET\n\nThe US Product and Safety Commission on Tuesday announced a \"battery safety\" recall of about 78,500 HP laptops for what the UPSC calls \"fire and burn hazards.\"\n\nHP requested we emphasize that it's recalling the batteries, not the laptops. Given that most batteries are nonremovable by end users, it amounts to the same thing on your end -- you still have to ship your laptop off somewhere. However, it does mean that the company replaces the battery, not the entire laptop, so the distinction matters a lot to them. (Like cars getting recalled for faulty airbags.)\n\nHP initiated the recall in January 2018, and expanded it in January 2019, but the news hadn't widely circulated because of the US government shutdown. The UPSC finally posted the news to its site on Tuesday with the explanation, \"NOTE: This recall expansion was previously announced independently on Jan. 17, 2019 by the firm due to US government furlough.\" (We spotted it via Tom's Hardware.)\n\nThis is part of a continuing series of battery recalls from HP. The Jan. 17 recall was for about 51,000 models, but 41,000 were recalled in June 2016 and 100,000 in January 2017, bringing the total for the past two-and-a-half years to almost a quarter of a million.\n\nThe recall applies to laptops sold between April 2015 and December 2018. Per HP:\n\nBatteries affected by this program may have been shipped with specific HP Probook 64x (G2 and G3), HP ProBook 65x (G2 and G3), HP ProBook 4xx G4 (430, 440, 450, 455, and 470), HP x360 310 G2, HP ENVY M6, HP Pavilion x360, HP 11 notebook computers and HP ZBook (17 G3, 17 G4, and Studio G3) mobile workstations sold worldwide from December 2015 through April 2018. They were also sold as accessories or provided as replacements from December 2015 through December 2018 for the above products, as well as additional products through HP or an authorized HP Service Provider, including certain HP Mobile Thin Client products.\n\nHP also warns, \"It is essential to recheck your battery, even if you did so previously and were informed that it was not affected. However if you have already received a replacement battery, you are not affected by this expansion.\"\n\nIf you suspect your laptop qualifies -- it doesn't apply to every model sold within that period -- you can download the validation utility from the recall page to check.\n\nUpdated 1:30 p.m. ET: Added clarification from HP.",

    "text": "Rick Wilking/Reuters\n\nConsumer sentiment rose by more than expected to 97.8 in the first half of March.\n\nIncreasing optimism was concentrated among lower- and middle-class households.\n\nThe gains come after disappointing sentiment readings at the beginning of 2019.\n\nPublic confidence in the economy rose by more than expected in the US in early March, particularly among lower- and middle-class households.\n\nConsumer sentiment rose 4.3% from a month earlier to 97.8, preliminary results from the University of Michigan\u2019s monthly survey showed Friday, compared with economist expectations for a 95.6 reading. Final results are scheduled to be released at the end of the month.\n\nLower- and middle-class Americans were more optimistic toward income potential, pulling the index higher. Overall sentiment jumped among households with incomes in the bottom two-thirds of the distribution, while the top income bracket's confidence in the economy rose at a much slower pace.\n\n\"Since households with incomes in the top third account for more than half of all consumer expenditures, cautious observers will conclude that the latest data are another indication that the end of the expansion is on the distant horizon,\" said Richard Curtin, the survey's chief economist.\n\nAll income groups were more positive about growth prospects for the overall economy \u2014 a rebound following weaker-than-expected consumer sentiment reports in recent months.\n\nFinancial-market turmoil at the end of 2018, fading stimulus, and the partial government shutdown that ended in January have weighed on outlooks toward the economy. Sentiment in February made a modest recovery after falling to its lowest level since October 2016 a month earlier.\n\nBut consumers appear to have shaken off some of these strains, according to Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, with expectations for the future rising to just off the September high.\n\n\"This matters, because it strongly supports our view that the slowing in consumption in recent months is more likely to be a transition to a sustainable pace, as the kick from tax cuts and lower gas prices fades, rather than the start of a sustained downtrend, ultimately leading to the end of the cycle,\" he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, data showed optimism among small businesses rebounded last month after also falling to a more than two-year low.\n\n\"Small-business owners are thankful to have the government shutdown in the rear-view mirror but need more certainty about the future,\" said Juanita Duggan, the NFIB's president and CEO.",

    "description": "OPINION: Nic Gabunada's amazing social media network ABS-CBN News Duterte 'nothing to do' with banned Facebook accounts SunStar Philippines Palace: Duterte has nothing to do with shutdown Facebook accounts INQUIRER.net Facebook denies bias in account takedown\u2026",
    "text": "In his briefing on the latest takedown of accounts in Facebook and Instagram in the Philippines found to be engaged in \u201ccoordinated inauthentic behavior,\u201d Nathaniel Gleicher, head of Facebook Cybersecurity Policy, underscored that the reason was not the posted content.\n\nHe said it was because \u201cthe people behind this activity coordinated with one another and used fake accounts to misrepresent themselves.\u201d That\u2019s \u201ccoordinated inauthentic behavior.\u201d\n\nIt so happened, however, that tracing the trail of the 67 Pages, 68 Facebook accounts, 40 Groups and 25 Instagram accounts that were taken down, led Gleicher and his team to Nic Gabunada, head of Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s social media during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nAn article in Medium.com by Melanie Smith, intelligence analyst at Graphika, the group that works with Facebook in investigating and analyzing social media landscape, also said the takedown includes \u201ca set of 65 pages that were primarily engaged in spreading content supportive of President Duterte of the Philippines and promoting a number of Duterte-aligned politicians due to run in the House of Representatives elections, scheduled for May. This set of accounts ranges widely in popularity, with the number of \u201clikes\u201d per pages spanning from 3,318 to 457,624.\u201d\n\nExamples shown were posts by supporters of senatorial candidates Bong Go, Ronald de la Rosa, Imee Marcos and Sonny Angara.\n\nSmith also said the large majority of the content shared by pages taken down was political in nature. \u201cIn our categorization of content and narratives shared by the network, we found that 46.2% of the pages shared content explicitly supporting President Duterte as a politician, and the second largest category (27.7%) shared news articles that paint the Duterte administration and the government writ large in a positive light.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting, however, that most of the pages taken down were created in 2017. The oldest page was created May 2013 and the most recent page on October 24, 2018.\n\nThis means that after the 2016 elections, Gabunada expanded and strengthened the network he organized during the campaign.\n\nUnlike during the campaign when, he said, those were mostly run by volunteers, they seem to be well-funded because Facebook said Gabunada\u2019s network spent $59,000 USD for ads on Facebook \u201cpaid for in Philippine peso, Saudi riyal and US dollars. The first ad ran in January 2014 and the most recent ad ran in March 2019.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with VERA Files immediately after the 2016 elections, Gabunada, a marketing executive from Davao (he formerly headed ABS-CBN Research and Business Analysis), he said he drew from his experience as an activist in the '80s for the social media network he set up for the Duterte campaign. He said that he was working closely with Leoncio Evasco Jr., former priest who joined the underground communist movement during the Marcos years, later entered politics and was appointed by Duterte as his cabinet secretary in 2016.\n\nEvasco has resigned from the cabinet and is now a candidate for governor in Bohol.\n\nEvasco\u2019s name was mentioned by Smith in her analysis of the posts.\n\nSmith said they examined \u201cRoughly 48,600 words\u201d from recent posts and from the about sections of these 65 pages.\n\n\u201cAnalysis of this aggregated text data revealed the main languages of messaging to be English and Filipino, with roughly half of all messaging occurring in each language. Examining triplets of words occurring in this corpus (also known as \u201ctrigrams\u201d) lent insight into the main topics of interest for messaging across these pages. The most frequent trigrams in the set nearly all contain Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s name or the names of other current members of the Duterte administration, such as Jun Evasco. Particularly frequent are trigrams wishing happy birthday to President Duterte and Secretary Evasco. Bohol, a city and province in the Philippines due to have local elections in early May, also appears high up in the most frequently used trigrams in the set. Other common topics in this set included Ferdinand Marcos and support for Duterte\u2019s war on drugs,\u201d she said.\n\nIt's not all politics, Smith said: \u201cAbout 12.3% of the pages in this set were seemingly focused on topics other than politics: they primarily include fan pages for Korean actors, models, and popstars, as well as a LeBron James fan page. These pages appeared to be run by administrators in the Philippines and occasionally interweave pro-government news into their timelines. Inspection of the page histories revealed that some of these pages had been repurposed from Duterte support pages.\n\nAn example page showed \u201cSuportang James EVER\u201d which was s previously named \u201cSuportang Duterte EVER.\u201d\n\nReads Smith\u2019s analysis here.\n\nIt\u2019s an amazing network that Gabunada has created and nurtured.\n\n***\n\nBlog: www.ellentordesillas.com\n\nEmail: [email protected]\n\n###\n\nDisclaimer: The views in this blog are those of the blogger and do not necessarily reflect the views of ABS-CBN Corp.",

    "description": "The economy has slackened off because households and businesses have curbed spending, but the government isn\u2019t doing as much heavy lifting, either. What does that mean for the economy in 2019?",
    "text": "Getty Images Government spending sputtered in the fourth quarter and was a drag on the economy, GDP figures show.\n\nThe economy has slackened off because households and businesses have curbed spending, but the government isn\u2019t doing as much heavy lifting, either.\n\nThe pace of U.S. growth slowed to 2.2% in the fourth quarter from 3.4% and 4.2% in the prior two periods, according to revised figures on gross domestic product.\n\nRead: U.S. economy grew a slower 2.2% in the fourth quarter, revised GDP figures show\n\nEconomists predict even slower growth in the first three months of 2019 \u2014 less than 2%.\n\nRead: The Fed is gun-shy because of a quarter-century of low inflation\n\nThe surge in growth in the middle of 2018 can largely be explained by the Trump tax cuts that put more money in the hands of millions of American consumers. Businesses also benefited from the biggest reduction in corporate tax rates in 32 years.\n\nThe economy got a smaller but still sizable pop, however, from a big burst of government spending. Democrats and Republicans agreed in early 2018 to bust existing budget caps by adding almost $300 billion in new spending over a two-year period.\n\nThe result: A wave of federal spending, some of which trickled down to states and local governments. Altogether, Washington gave the economy a big shot in the arm and helped fuel a major rally in the stock markets DJIA, +0.15% SPX, +0.21%\n\n\u201cThough this deal was perhaps overshadowed by the tax cuts, it also played a key role in pushing real GDP growth to roughly 3% in 2018,\u201d Wells Fargo economists Jay Bryson and Michael Pugliese wrote in a note to clients.\n\nGovernment spending represented 13% of the economy\u2019s growth last summer and 10% last spring.

Federal outlays barely rose while state and local spending fell a stiff 1.3% \u2014 the biggest decline in almost two years.\n\nIn short, the government was a net drag on the economy in the waning months of 2018.\n\nThe partial federal shutdown that lasted 35 days from late December to mid-January can partly be blamed for lower consumer and government spending, but only partly. The shutdown began Dec. 22 when there was just nine days left in the quarter.\n\nThe government drag is not expected to persist in the first quarter since federal outlays were scheduled to rise in the first half of 2019, but the effects of the shutdown remain unclear.\n\nWhatever the case, the Trump tax cuts and higher federal spending are not expected to deliver the same payoff to the economy this year as they did in 2018.",

    "description": "The U.S. government complied a database including American citizens and then questioned or arrested many of them.",
    "text": "Many covering or offering assistance to the thousands of migrants in the caravan have been targeted by the U.S. government. MARVIN RECINOS/Getty Images\n\nDays before the Nov. 2018 midterm elections, President Trump cooked up pre-election hysteria over the so-called \u201ccaravan\u201d of migrants a thousand miles away in southern Mexico, who were slowly making their way on foot towards the U.S. border. The president\u2019s anti-immigrant chauvinism couldn\u2019t stop his party from losing the House in a blue wave of Democratic victories, and afterward Trump largely dropped the issue until it became politically useful again months later during the government shutdown. The American government, however, sharpened its focus after the furor died down, according to a chilling report from NBC 7, NBC News\u2019 local affiliate in San Diego. Documents leaked to NBC 7 show that the Trump administration went about gathering names of journalists, activists, and attorneys who had covered or worked with the fleeing migrants, and created a database that included dossiers on 57 people, including 10 journalists.\n\nThose swept up in the government database where then targets for surveillance and harassment with at least 21 individuals subsequently questioned or arrested by Customs and Border Protection. The U.S. government, in some cases, placed alerts on the targeted individuals\u2019 passports who were listed in the database titled: \u201cSan Diego Sector Foreign Operations Branch: Migrant Caravan FY-2019, Suspected Organizers, Coordinators, Instigators and Media.\u201d The documents dated Jan. 9, 2019 included files on some 39 American citizens, including seven who were tracked by the U.S. government. The documents are part of an interagency \u201cSharePoint\u201d application accessible to a myriad of agencies, including agents from Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), the U.S.\n\nBorder Patrol, Homeland Security Investigations, and the San Diego office of the FBI.\n\nSome of the individuals who were there for the ultimate caravan standoff with border patrol suspected they were being targeted in the aftermath and the leaked documents showed the extent to which they were being singled out, including journalists being harassed at the U.S.-Mexican border, taken into secondary screening on the grounds it was a national security matter, and in one case denied entry to Mexico altogether. Here\u2019s more on what was compiled from NBC 7:\n\nFor each person, the documents show their photo, often from their passport but in some cases from their social media accounts, along with their personal information. That information includes the person\u2019s date of birth, their \u201ccountry of commencement,\u201d and their alleged role tied to the migrant caravan. The information also includes whether officials placed an alert on the person\u2019s passport. One dossier, shared with NBC 7, was on Nicole Ramos, the Refugee Director and attorney for Al Otro Lado, a law center for migrants and refugees in Tijuana, Mexico. The dossier included personal details on Ramos, including specific details about the car she drives, her mother\u2019s name, and her work and travel history.\n\nTrump\u2019s America.",

    "text": "By the time you read this, I hope US government workers have at least received their far-delayed pay owed to them for their work during the government shutdown. But no matter who blinked first to end the shutdown (or possibly start it again), chances are another self-inflicted crisis will likely happen between now and 2020 because Washington politicians don\u2019t remember how to work together.\n\nThis is no way to run a \u201csuperpower.\u201d Americans are pissed off nationwide, and despite the president\u2019s insistence that America is respected again, confidence in American leadership has plummeted worldwide. Even so, the US will likely survive its embarrassing inability to conduct the business of government \u2014 it\u2019s too big to fail.\n\nWe desperately need to remember Patrick Henry\u2019s declaration, \u201cUnited we stand, divided we fall.\u201d What if factions within a company reflected the political parties\u2019 disagreement on what constitutes reality and utter lack of ability to collaborate? That would be no way to run a company. Unity is as important in business as it is in government, maybe even more so. Most businesses aren\u2019t too big to fail.\n\nWhat color is the sky in your world?\n\nIf people can\u2019t agree on the set of facts surrounding an issue, they can\u2019t come up with solutions. This proves true in Washington where competing truth bubbles run rampant as politicians try to gin up support with spin. As a nation, we\u2019ve slowly built up a tolerance for lies.\n\nBut now the falsehoods are streaming out of Washington at a fire-hose volume, and we\u2019ve reached a crisis point. At the end of the year, The Washington Post noted that President Trump averaged 15 lies a day in 2018 \u2014 nearly triple the 2017 average. Today, the credibility gap yawns wider than ever before, and it makes solving problems almost impossible.\n\nUnfortunately, \u201cfake news\u201d isn\u2019t just a political phenomenon \u2013 it\u2019s a problem in company boardrooms and leadership meetings too. And just as politicians often cite misleading statistics to make their case, business leaders are frequently guilty of cherry-picking \u201cfacts\u201d that put their department in the best light and cast blame on others.\n\nThe culprit? Incomplete data or numbers taken out of context. Say a marketing team needs to generate 1,000 qualified leads so sales can close 50 deals. The company comes up short in its sales goals, but marketing cites numbers from its martech stack that show it held up its end of the bargain. Then the sales team makes a quick return with competing data from its customer relationship management (CRM) system which supports the sales team\u2019s claim that \u201cmarketing\u2019s leads were garbage.\u201d Who are we to believe?\n\nThe underlying problem in this scenario is that there\u2019s no shared reality, no credible data set that is shared across the entire organization. To solve the \u201cfake news\u201d problem, companies should put all their sales and marketing data in their CRM system. Otherwise, they\u2019ll continue to base actions on competing versions of reality. And as we\u2019ve seen from Washington, that way lies madness \u2014 and dysfunction.\n\n\u201cStronger together\u201d is more than a political slogan\n\nNo matter if you\u2019re a Democrat, Republican, or otherwise identified, history clearly demonstrates that when people work together, they can achieve more than they can separately. In a rare show of bipartisan unity, Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate worked together to pass the First Step Act, a crime bill designed to reduce recidivism and reform federal criminal justice operations \u2014 a bill Mr. Trump signed into law late last year.\n\nThe overwhelming support for the bill shows what political factions can do when they stop lying to us and each other, come together around a common purpose, and collaborate to solve problems. Unfortunately, that bill\u2019s passage was an anomaly; the parties remain divided, and resulted in the longest government shutdown in history. The same is true in too many businesses, where departments work at cross-purposes \u2014 and lose opportunities due to lack of collaboration.\n\nBuilding a \u201cstronger together\u201d culture starts with understanding each other\u2019s different points of view as well as your shared mission. In Washington, too often legislators put party politics over their common duty of conducting the people\u2019s business. In business, department leaders often point fingers to absolve themselves of blame instead of collaborating to solve problems and focusing on their true goal of creating value for the company.\n\n\u201cBlame-casting\u201d might work in the short term \u2014 the boss might buy one team\u2019s explanation and hold another group responsible for a setback. But is that really what\u2019s important? Do we come to work to polish our image in the boss\u2019s eyes, or are we there to add value by generating revenue and achieving business objectives? For most professional adults, it\u2019s the latter, and to truly move the needle and accomplish a business goal, collaboration is a must.\n\nIn our marketing and sales example, it\u2019s critical for the two teams to come together and clearly define what a qualified lead looks like and exactly how it is generated. The two teams need to understand and respect each other\u2019s place in the value-creation chain and agree on a set of metrics that indicate progress as well as a data source that is credible to everyone. Then they can work together like adults instead of feuding like middle-schoolers \u2014 or politicians.\n\nGuard against factionalism\n\nThe political divisions in the US are real. Divided companies tend to split along fault lines that reflect genuine differences of opinions too. But true collaboration is defined by bringing together different perspectives so you shouldn\u2019t expect an era of kumbaya. If new and different ideas are flowing, a debate \u2014 even a heated one \u2014 on how to achieve objectives is possible, even if everyone in the organization agrees on a single source of data reality and fully commits to collaboration.\n\nThe necessary element in both government and business is a shared sense of purpose and goals. Competing visions on how to achieve those objectives are inevitable, but factionalism is a choice. The gridlock in Washington reflects a slide into factionalism \u2014 one anticipated by George Washington and John Adams when they warned of the dangers of a two-party system.\n\nThe American democratic experiment is being tested now. Many companies are dealing with a similar stress test for parallel reasons. The good news is that we get to choose our path every day. If your company has fallen into factionalism, there\u2019s still time to stop \u2014 do a reality check, recognize your common goals, and work together to achieve them. If our feuding political parties can\u2019t set a good example, at least they serve as a cautionary tale. It won\u2019t be easy but it\u2019s necessary, because in your business, failure shouldn\u2019t be an option.",

    "text": "NSA domestic surveillance debate returns to Congress with 'Ending Mass Collection of Americans\u2019 Phone Records Act'\n\nPHOTO: NSA PHOTO: NSA\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time, finally, to put a stake in the heart of this unnecessary government surveillance program and start to restore some of Americans\u2019 liberties,\u201d Wyden said in a statement.\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-KY), Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-CA 19th District), Rep. Justin Amash (R-MI 3rd District), and Sen, Ron Wyden (D-OR) are introducing a bill to \u201cfinally abolish the last vestige of the NSA's post-9/11 domestic bulk phone records surveillance,\u201d writes Spencer Ackerman at the Daily Beast.\n\nThe bipartisan legislation introduced today would permanently end the domestic metadata collection program, as awareness of the operational challenges and civil rights implications grows.\n\nSenators Rand Paul and Ron Wyden sponsored the legislation. A companion version was introduced Wednesday in the House by congressional representatives Justin Amash and Zoe Lofgren.\n\nThe 'Ending Mass Collection of Americans\u2019 Phone Records Act', as it's called, removes all remaining authority for NSA and FBI to collect phone records in the United States, \u201cother than those identified by the specific selection term included in [a warrant] application.\u201d\n\nFrom Spencer Ackerman at the Daily Beast.\n\nIn particular, the bill would kill off what\u2019s called the Call Detail Records program under an effort to restrict the domestic phone-data dragnet in the wake of Edward Snowden\u2019s surveillance revelations. Before the so-called USA FREEDOM Act became law in 2015, some civil libertarians warned that its privacy protections, watered down by intelligence officials and their allies, would prove inadequate. They turned out to be prescient: the FREEDOM Act led to an overcollection of call data so massive that the NSA announced last it was deleting the entire FREEDOM Act trove, which included some 685 million phone records. The failure of the USA FREEDOM Act was significant enough that the Trump administration \u201cactually hasn\u2019t been using it for the past six months,\u201d a national-security aide to House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy told the Lawfare podcast earlier this month. That apparent shutdown prompted speculation in surveillance-policy circles that the NSA might have either migrated its domestic phone-data dragnets under authorities outside of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) \u2013 something the NSA has repeatedly done with its post-9/11 warrantless surveillance efforts \u2013 or shut down the collection out of an assessment that analyzing call patterns at scale is an outmoded form of counterterrorism surveillance.\n\nThe debate over NSA surveillance has officially returned to Congress. @RonWyden, @DrRandPaul, @justinamash and @RepZoeLofgren introduce legislation to permanently end the domestic metadata program amid growing recognition of its operation challenges https://t.co/aIG3NXoHe0 \u2014 Dustin Volz (@dnvolz) March 28, 2019",

Sign up for the Balance of Power newsletter, and follow Bloomberg Politics on Twitter and Facebook for more.\n\nDonald Trump isn\u2019t giving up pushing Congress to fund his wall.The presidential budget request set for release this morning in Washington includes at least $8.6 billion in new funding for the construction of a barrier on the border with Mexico.The proposal threatens to breathe fresh life into a partisan dispute that prompted the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. And it shows Trump \u2014 who capitulated to wall opponents in the Democratic Party to re-open the government amid mounting strains on the federal workforce \u2014 will continue to make his signature 2016 campaign promise a bone of contention with Congress as his re-election campaign gets underway.\n\nThe president\u2019s latest bid for congressional wall money is in addition to the funds that he\u2019s hoping to allocate through executive action after declaring a national emergency in February over the situation on the border.With Democrats in control of the U.S. House, the dynamics in Congress aren\u2019t likely to change to Trump\u2019s advantage. But that may not be the point \u2014 keeping up the fight can help him energize his base, whose enthusiasm in November of next year may be key to him winning a second term.\n\nGlobal Headlines\n\nTroll tactics | Russian internet trolls may be shifting strategy to disrupt the 2020 U.S. elections and circumvent social media companies\u2019 efforts to block fake content, cybersecurity experts said. Some are amplifying existing content rather than creating fake messages, to hide their identities. Others are hacking into devices to open large numbers of apparently legitimate user accounts. FBI Director Christopher Wray warned that \u201cmalign\u201d foreign influence campaigns are likely to intensify.\n\nBoeing jets grounded | China and Ethiopia grounded their fleets of Boeing Co. 737 Max 8 jets after a model operated by Ethiopian Airlines crashed minutes after takeoff yesterday, killing all 157 people on board \u2014 the second deadly accident involving the best-selling plane in five months. While Boeing said it\u2019s working closely with the investigators to discover the cause of the disaster, its shares fell today in Asia and Europe.\n\nBrexit brink | With talks deadlocked, U.K. ministers are calling for last-minute concessions by the European Union so Theresa May can get her Brexit deal through Parliament this week. But it\u2019s looking unlikely the prime minister will be able to reverse the historic defeat she suffered in January. So with under three weeks to go until Britain is due to leave the bloc, Brexit could yet be delayed, abandoned in all but name \u2014 or called off altogether.\n\nNordic reverberations | The Finnish government\u2019s surprise resignation comes at an especially bad time for the country\u2019s influence in Europe. Finland\u2019s turn with the European Union\u2019s rotating six-month presidency is set to begin July 1, and the collapse is complicating preparations. The EU country in that role, currently Romania, manages the bloc\u2019s legislative business and represents them in deliberations with the European Parliament.\n\nAiling leader | Algerian President Abdelaziz Bouteflika arrived home yesterday after receiving medical treatment in Geneva, to pursue his bid to seek a fifth term in the face of mounting protests in the North African oil producer. Largely incapacitated since suffering a stroke in 2013, the 82-year-old has failed to calm the unrest with a pledge to serve an abridged term if he wins next month's vote. In a sign of the army's growing concern over the crisis, the chief of staff said the military and the people \u201care partners in one destiny.\u201d\n\nWhat to Watch\n\nThe biggest spat between Italy's populist allies Matteo Salvini and Luigi Di Maio is sparking speculation their government could collapse and force an early election this year. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani arrived in Baghdad today and will meet his Iraqi counterpart Barham Salih and Prime Minister Adil Abdul Mahdi during a trip that's expected to focus on energy and trade deals bypassing U.S. sanctions.\n\nAnd finally... Resurgent tensions between India and Pakistan are taking a toll on the film industry. Pakistan has halted the screening of Bollywood movies in theaters across the country, forcing the nation\u2019s largest chain to show reruns of old Pakistani films. It comes as India announced the dates for the world's largest election, where 900 million voters \u2014 more than the population of Europe \u2014 will determine whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi secures a second term.\n\n--With assistance from Anthony Halpin, John Follain and Stuart Biggs.\n\nTo contact the author of this story: Kathleen Hunter in London at khunter9@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Ruth Pollard at rpollard2@bloomberg.net, Karl Maier\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.",

    "text": "President Donald Trump will request at least $8.6 billion in new funding for the construction of a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border as part of his budget request to be released Monday. The budget plan will also assume continued robust economic growth in the U.S.\n\nThe president\u2019s proposal asks for an additional $5 billion in funding for the Department of Homeland Security and $3.6 billion in new military construction funds, according to a senior administration official, who requested anonymity to discuss the plan ahead of its release.\n\nThe request is in addition to the $6.7 billion that Trump is hoping to allocate through executive action after declaring a national emergency over the situation on the border in February, and is likely to tee up a new battle with Congress.\n\n\u201cThe whole issue of the wall, of border security, is of paramount importance,\u201d National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said Sunday in an interview with Fox News. \u201cWe have a crisis down there.\u201d\n\nThe White House request, reported earlier by Reuters, represents the first marker in what\u2019s certain to be another protracted battle between the White House and congressional negotiators.\n\nTrump rejected a bipartisan funding agreement in late 2018 because it didn\u2019t include enough wall funding, leading to a 35-day federal government shutdown. He finally agreed to reopen the government when lawmakers provided him $1.375 billion for new border construction, and announced his plans for the national emergency.\n\nTrump said he\u2019s \u201cstopping an invasion\u201d of the U.S. in Twitter comments Saturday directed at conservative commentator Ann Coulter, whose criticism reportedly helped inspire his decision to hunker down for a record-long shutdown.\n\nThe request is just a part of the president\u2019s 2020 budget blueprint, which he\u2019s expected to present to lawmakers on Monday. It\u2019s the first since Democrats won control of the House in November\u2019s mid-term elections, and will kick off months of bargaining over his spending requests and proposed funding cuts for many domestic programs.\n\nThe budget document also includes economic projections for the next decade, with the administration forecasting continued expansion.\n\nThe budget document will project the economy growing at an average of 3 percent annually over the net decade, according to the official, including 3.2 percent growth for 2019. The White House predicts the economy will grow 3.1 percent in 2020, 3 percent in 2021, and 2.8 percent in 2026. The economic projections were first reported by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe projections are at odds with those of many private forecasters. A Bloomberg survey puts the consensus U.S. GDP forecast for 2019 at 2.5 percent, trailing off to 1.9 percent in 2020 as the impact of the 2017 Republican tax cuts fades.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.",

    "description": "Incomes rose modestly in February after falling in the first month of the year and declining inflation gave Americans even more bang for their buck, government figures show.",
    "text": "Getty Images Consumers are able to spend more because of rising incomes and falling inflation.\n\nThe numbers: Consumer spending started off on a weak note in January and inflation continued to wane, bolstering the decision by the Federal Reserve to shelf plans to keep raising U.S. interest rates, long-delayed government figures show.\n\nSpending increased just 0.1% in January after a surprising 0.6% plunge in December that was the biggest since the Great Recession a decade ago. The partial government shutdown that lasted through most of January helped depress spending, as did declining prices at the gas pump. Americans also spent less on new cars and trucks.\n\nMore notably, the closely followed PCE inflation gauge fell for the first time in almost two years. The index slipped 0.1% in January to knock the yearly rate down to 1.4% from 1.8%.\n\nThat\u2019s the lowest level since the fall of 2016, putting it well below the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target.\n\nThe closely followed core rate that excludes food and energy rose 0.1% in January. The 12-month rate also fell a few ticks, to 1.8% from 2%.\n\nPersonal incomes, meanwhile, increased a steady 0.2% in February, the government said Friday. The report excluded figures on consumer spending and inflation in February because of delays in collecting the data. The government plans to catch up by next month.\n\nRead: U.S. economy grew a slower 2.2% in the fourth quarter, revised GDP figures show\n\nWhat happened: Incomes have zigzagged over the past three months, but they are still sharply higher compared to a year earlier. Wages are rising at the fastest pace in a decade.\n\nThe increase in incomes in February follows a small decline in January and a big spike in December, largely reflecting swings in payments of dividends, farm income and earnings of small businesses.\n\nHigher spending in January was largely the result of households spending more in financial services and insurance.\n\nThe U.S. savings rate, meanwhile, slipped to a still-healthy 7.5% in January from 7.7%.\n\nRead: Gush of government spending that boosted economy last year is fading\n\nBig picture: The U.S. economy slowed toward the end of 2018 and inflation tapered off, prodding the Fed to terminate plans to keep raising interest rates. The subdued rate of inflation means the central bank can wait awhile to see if the economy speeds up again before taking any further action.\n\nWhat should help the economy is a robust labor market in which and the rate of layoffs and unemployment sit near a half-century low.\n\nRead: The Fed is gun-shy because of a quarter-century of low inflation\n\nWhat they saying?: \u201cAmerican consumers remained cautious in January amidst the government shutdown,\u201d economist Katherine Judge of CIBC World Markets said. \u201cHowever, we still expect to see a rebound in February given the recovery in confidence following the end of the government shutdown.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is little prospect of higher inflation forcing the Fed into action any time soon,\u201d said senior U.S. economist Andrew Hunter of Capital Economics.\n\nMarket reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.15% and S&P 500 SPX, +0.21% rose sharply in Friday trades, with the Dow topping 25,800.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, +1.95% rose slightly to 2.43%.

    "text": "lenetstan/Shutterstock\n\nThe initial-public-offering market suffered through a slow start to the year because of the partial government shutdown and the brutal fourth quarter for financial markets, but public debuts are ratcheting back up.\n\nWhile a host of high-profile unicorns and decacorns like Lyft, Uber, Airbnb, and Slack are set to debut on the public market this year, so far healthcare has dominated the US IPO slate.\n\nIt's still early to compare this year's performance to prior years', but so far healthcare is the most active sector to debut on US exchanges in 2019, according to Renaissance Capital.\n\nThe group's showing in the first quarter suggests a strong year ahead for biotech and healthcare, some analysts say.\n\nInvestors in private and public companies know there's a massive slate of highly anticipated initial public offerings coming this year.\n\nHigh-profile technology and transportation unicorns and decacorns like Lyft, Uber, Slack, and Pinterest are all set to debut on the public markets in the coming months after a sleepy first quarter. A host of others, like Airbnb and Peleton, have also reportedly explored going public.\n\nAnd even after a slow start to IPOs this year \u2014 in part because of the partial government shutdown and one of the worst fourth quarters on record \u2014 an overshadowed corner of the market is enjoying a strong run: healthcare.\n\nThe sector is the most active to debut in the US public market so far in 2019, followed by financials, according to data from Renaissance Capital. Healthcare is also the most active over the past year.\n\nInvestors' excitement around newly public biotechnology companies suggests a strong year ahead after healthcare outperformed the broader US IPO market in 2018, the Oppenheimer analysts Jay Olson and Silvan T\u00fcrkcan said.\n\nWhile it's still too early to compare, initial IPO returns in the biotech space are positive this year. They've averaged 2% in about one month compared with 2018 IPOs returning 4% for the whole year, according to their analysis.\n\nSo far this year, 11 biotech IPOs have raised a combined $1.2 billion. Notably, those IPOs in 2019 have been predominantly in the cancer-immunotherapy space, according to Oppenheimer's analysis. The largest so far is Gossamer Bio, which raised $317 million.\n\n\"In discussions with investors, we have received favorable feedback and continued interest in 2019 Biotech IPOs,\" they wrote.\n\nRead more: The market for biotech IPOs is red hot \u2014 here are the top 10 of 2018\n\nThe relatively high number of healthcare companies entering the market isn't just confined to the US. Globally, healthcare and technology were the most active sectors in the first quarter, according to Ernst & Young data.\n\nBetween January and March, there were 45 IPOs in the technology space \u2014 the most of any sector \u2014 followed by the 32 in the healthcare sector.\n\nSo where is all this excitement coming from, and is it a sign of a group that's overheating?\n\nPut simply, and while trying not to sound \"clich\u00e9,\" the Stifel biotechnology analyst Paul Matteis says there's a widespread perception that science around drug development is improving and investors want to get in on advances in different areas like gene therapy, neuroscience, and oncology.\n\n\"It's still early days for leveraging some of the newer tools, like gene therapy and RNAi, that have emerged as vehicles to leverage science that's improving across an array of disease areas,\" Matteis told Markets Insider on Thursday, adding that companies felt as if they had better access to capital.\n\n\"There's been this expansion of tools to tackle and target specific genes,\" he said.\n\nStill, Matteis doesn't think investor sentiment is near the uber-bullish heights of 2015. Between 2014 and 2015, investors saw a relatively high 50 to 60 biotech IPOs a year, according to Oppenheimer's analysis.\n\nThe Nasdaq Biotechnology Index is up just over 13% this year, barely outperforming the S&P 500's 12.8% gain. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund has gained 6% this year.\n\nNow read more markets coverage from Markets Insider and Business Insider:",

    "description": "Ten of the 12 Federal Reserve bank districts say \u2018slight to moderate\u2019 growth in late January and February, according to the central bank\u2019s Beige Book report released Wednesday.",
    "text": "Bloomberg News/Landov Federal workers waited in line at a food bank in Washington D.C. during the partial government shutdown. The government\u2019s closure led to slower economic activity in many regions of the country, the Fed said.\n\nThe description: Ten of the Federal Reserve\u2019s 12 districts saw \u201cslight-to-moderate\u201d growth in late January and February, while St. Louis and Philadelphia reported \u201cflat economic conditions,\u201d according to the Fed\u2019s Beige Book report released Wednesday.\n\nWhat happened: The tone of the Beige Book report was somber. The partial government led to slower activity in about six Fed districts. The impact hit a wide range of sectors, including retail, auto sales, tourism, real estate, restaurants, manufacturing and staffing services.\n\nConsumer spending was \u201cmixed\u201d and several districts said retail and auto sales were lower due to harsh winter weather and higher costs of credit.\n\nManufacturing activity strengthened but firms conveyed a wall of worry about weakening global demand, higher costs due to tariffs, and ongoing trade policy uncertainty.\n\nSeveral districts reported faster growth for input prices than selling prices. The ability to pass along these higher input costs to consumers \u201cvaried by region and industry.\u201d The trade tariffs were leading to upward price pressures in a few districts.\n\nThe labor market remained a bright spot. The majority of districts reported higher wages. Contacts complained about labor shortages.\n\nThe big picture: Fed officials have been forecasting an economic slowdown in 2019 and the process underway. The big unknown is whether this slowdown will be moderate or gathers steam. Inflation doesn\u2019t seem so quiet in this report either.\n\nThe Fed has said it won\u2019t adjust interest rates again until it is more certain about the economic outlook. As a result, the central bank is universally seen as holding its benchmark interest rate steady at its meeting later this month. Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren said there might be \u201cseveral\u201d meetings where rates are left unchanged.\n\nMarket reaction: Stocks were weaker Wednesday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.15% down about 100 points. This would mark the third straight day of declines in stock prices.",

The figure includes both single adults and whole families behind bars. It\u2019s an increase of approximately 2,000 people in the month-plus since Jan. 30, when ICE, it previously told The Daily Beast, was detaining 48,088 people. And it\u2019s just another 2,000 people shy of the 52,000-person daily detentions ICE is asking Congress to fund in its next budget. Asked what accounts for the increase, ICE spokeswoman Danielle Bennett said in a statement: \u201cICE makes custody determinations on a case-by-case basis, in accordance with U.S. law and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) policy, considering the merits and factors of each case while adhering to current agency priorities, guidelines and legal mandates. Ensuring there are sufficient beds available to meet the current demand for detention space is crucial to the success of ICE\u2019s overall mission.\u201d It isn\u2019t clear where ICE would have found the money for the increase. A year ago, when passing ICE\u2019s most recent budget, legislators explicitly instructed the interior-immigration agency to cap detentions at 40,520. Instead, by the summer ICE had surpassed that total, leading its Department of Homeland Security parent to raid its other accounts, including FEMA, to float ICE. A Senate appropriator \u2013 the last sort of person an executive agency wishes to anger come budget season \u2013 called ICE out for continuing a policy of \u201cmaximum cruelty.\u201d\n\nRead the rest here: ICE Is Detaining 50,000 People, a New All-Time High [daily beast].\n\nRelated observations from Twitter, below.\n\nThese disturbing, authoritarian practices are what we\u2019re funding with every dollar given to DHS & ICE with 0 accountability \u2b07\ufe0f https://t.co/iKM6sVVOcr \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) March 7, 2019",

    "text": "This is an excerpt from a story delivered exclusively to Business Insider Intelligence E-Commerce Briefing subscribers. To receive the full story plus other insights each morning, click here.\n\nUS retail sales totaled $504.4 billion in January 2019, according to a report from the US Census Bureau. This is up .2% from last December's performance and 2.3% year-over-year (YoY).\n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence\n\nThese improvements are particularly important following retail's poor performance in December 2018 \u2014 when it had the biggest drop on a month-to-month basis since 2009 \u2014 as they indicate that the industry may avoid a prolonged slide.\n\nA number of retail segments recovered, with e-commerce coming in as one of the top performers. After growing only 2% YoY in December, nonstore retailers' sales, which includes e-commerce, rose 7.3% YoY, giving it the second highest YoY growth in January behind building material's 8.7% YoY jump.\n\nOther segments like food and beverage stores, health and personal care stores, and the group including sporting goods stores saw higher annual sales growth in January than in December. Having a number of areas perform well could mean that retail as a whole is trending in the right direction, but segments including furniture and apparel and clothing accessory stores saw worse YoY growth in January than they did in December, so there's still reason for concern.\n\nA revision of December's performance suggests that its sales growth was worse than originally thought, making January's results that much more important.The US Census Bureau originally reported that December's sales saw a 1.2% drop from November and a 2.3% increase YoY, but its newly released report puts December's month-to-month sales growth at -1.6% and its YoY growth at just 1.6%.\n\nThis means that retailers may be hurting more than originally thought, especially those that rely on holiday sales to bolster their full-year performances.\n\nJanuary could be the beginning of a positive trend in US retail in 2019 \u2014 something it desperately needs since it's off to a rough start.Retailers have already announced plans to close over 4,300 stores in 2019. Meanwhile, the year kicked off with the government shutdown and the US-China trade war is ongoing \u2014 and both impact retail's performance.\n\nIf January is the first of many months of improved sales and consumer spending, retailers may be able to weather these issues, but if not, store closures, retail bankruptcies, and other issues could pile up throughout 2019.\n\nInterested in getting the full story?

After a second positive drug screening, the person will lose SNAP benefits for one year. By the third strike, the person will become permanently ineligible.\n\nThe Alabama law isn't the first to try and limit SNAP benefits. The federal government has also made various efforts, including a proposed rule issued last month that would expand work requirements for SNAP recipients.\n\nA proposed Alabama law would require food stamp recipients to be drug tested to receive critical benefits.\n\nUnder current state law, there is no requirement for beneficiaries of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to be drug tested, according to a synopsis of the bill, H.B. 3.\n\nBut, under H.B. 3, that could soon change. The bill, sponsored by Rep. State Senator James Hanes, would require SNAP benefits to be tested for substance abuse \"if there is a reasonable suspicion that the person uses or is under the influence of a drug,\" the legislation states.\n\nThe federal SNAP program, administered by the US Department of Agriculture, offers nutritional assistance to low-income individuals and families nationwide. In 2016, the program provided about $1.25 billion in food benefits to more than 850,000 Alabamans each month, according to the Department of Agriculture. The year before, the program served almost 85 percent of those eligible for benefits across the state.\n\nA person who tests positively for drugs the first time around will receive a warning, according to the bill. After a second positive drug screening, the person will lose SNAP benefits for one year. By the third strike, the person will become permanently ineligible.\n\nIf the SNAP recipient refuses to take a drug test \u2014 or delays the screening beyond the time set by the department \u2014 they will also become ineligible for benefits. The legislation adds that if the parent of a dependent child tests positive for drugs without a valid prescription, \"the parent may designate a third party to receive the benefits for the benefit of the dependent child.\"\n\nThe bill, which was introduced last week, was referred to Alabama's House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday.\n\n\"I introduced this legislation for several reasons. One was to insure needy children be fed. Also, to reduce fraud,\" Hanes told INSIDER via email. \"This is legislation the working class people have been begging for, for years.\"\n\nThe Alabama law isn't the first to try and limit SNAP benefits. Last year, the Trump administration considered a plan that would allow states to require certain food stamp recipients to be drug tested, the Associated Press reported.\n\nThe administration also included a proposal in its $867 billion farm bill to impose work requirements on adults using SNAP, according to The New York Times. That proposal was ultimately dropped by Republican and Democratic negotiators.\n\nMost recently, the White House issued a proposed rule last month that would expand work requirements for SNAP recipients. Under the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008, and while able-bodied adults without dependents are typically limited to SNAP benefits for three months in a three-year period, the Department of Agriculture can waive the time limit in areas with unemployment rates over 10 percent or where there is a lack of sufficient jobs.\n\nThe new proposed rule would limit states' ability to use those waivers and would allow the federal government to more strictly administer existing work requirements for SNAP recipients.\n\nAround 775,000 people who rely on SNAP could lose benefits under the proposed rule, according to the Greater Philadelphia Coalition Against Hunger.\n\n\"Long-term reliance on government assistance has never been part of the American dream,\" Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said in a press release about the proposed rule. \"As we make benefits available to those who truly need them, we must also encourage participants to take proactive steps toward self-sufficiency.\"",

    "text": "Getty Images A rebound in job creation in March would help dispel lingering worries about the U.S. economy.\n\nThere\u2019s no getting around it: The U.S. economy got off to a lousy start in 2019. Now it\u2019s time to find out if growth is starting to perk up.\n\nA handful of key reports on jobs, retail sales, manufacturing and business investment will shed light on whether pitiful economic growth early in the year will yield to yet another spring revival.\n\nThe spotlight as usual will fall most heavily on the March employment at the end of the week. The U.S. created a measly 20,000 new jobs in February \u2014 the smallest gain in 17 months \u2014 and Wall Street is looking for a rebound.\n\nRead: U.S. economy grew a slower 2.2% in the fourth quarter, revised GDP figures show\n\nEconomists polled by MarketWatch predict the economy added 173,000 new jobs in March, keeping the unemployment rate near a half-century low of 3.8%.\n\nNumbers like that would go a long way to calm lingering worries about the U.S. lurching toward the first recession in a decade. Although the stock market DJIA, +0.15% SPX, +0.21% keeps churning higher, bond yields have tanked in a sign of pessimism about the economy.\n\n\u201cIf the numbers look strong, it will bolster the view that we just had a brief soft patch to start the year, and the economy will be fine,\u201d said David Donabedian, chief investment officer of CIBC U.S. private wealth management.\n\nBefore Wall Street is served the main course, investors will get a chance to snack on some appetizers.\n\nFirst up on Monday is retail sales for February. Sales sank in December and only partly recovered in January, hindered by a partial government shutdown that last more than a month.\n\nSales may have risen a bit faster in February, but not enough to signal all is well.\n\nRead: Gush of government spending that boosted economy last year is fading\n\nWhat\u2019s really worth chewing over are a pair of surveys that offer a birds-eye view of how executives who run America\u2019s top companies think the economy is doing.\n\nThe Institute for Supply Management\u2019s manufacturing index fell in February to the lowest level since before Donald Trump was elected president. An expected increase in March, however small, would be seen as a good sign.\n\nA similar ISM survey covering service-oriented companies that now dominate the U.S. economy has held up better and it remains near a 14-year high, but all signs point to some softening in March.\n\nRead: The Fed is gun-shy because of a quarter-century of low inflation\n\nAnother milepost worth watching is orders for durable goods in February.\n\nBusinesses cut back on investment in the second half of 2018 owing to festering trade tensions with China and worries about a slowing economy, among other things. And they haven\u2019t exactly put the pedal to the metal early this year despite steady sales and a big drop in borrowing costs.\n\nThe durable-goods report was delayed by the government shutdown and will be somewhat dated by the time it comes out, but it will likely confirm other readings showing tepid growth early in the year.",

    "description": "The partial government shutdown earlier this year that delayed elements of other NASA missions may have provided a reprieve of sorts for a troubled instrument on the agency\u2019s next Mars mission.",
    "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The five-week partial government shutdown earlier this year that delayed elements of other NASA missions may have provided a reprieve of sorts for a troubled instrument on the agency\u2019s next Mars mission.\n\nDuring a March 27 presentation to the National Academies\u2019 Committee on Astrobiology and Planetary Science here, Ken Farley, project scientist for the Mars 2020 rover, said that NASA directed the mission last December to conduct a \u201ctermination/continuation\u201d review for Scanning Habitable Environments with Raman & Luminescence for Organics & Chemicals (SHERLOC), one of the instruments on the rover.\n\n\u201cIt had a combination of technical challenges and high cost risk, meaning that it wasn\u2019t clear yet what exactly the instrument was supposed to cost because there were technical challenges that had not yet been overcome,\u201d he said.\n\nThat review was originally scheduled for early January, he said, but was delayed by the five-week partial government shutdown that started Dec. 22, curtailing all but essential agency activities. The review eventually took place in late January and early February, after the shutdown ended.\n\n\u201cWe had actually been able to make a fair bit of progress on solving some of the technical challenges\u201d during that time, Farley said. After the review, NASA leadership directed the mission to continue developing SHERLOC with \u201crelatively minor modifications to the procedures that are used to minimize further cost growth and to minimize the schedule risk.\u201d\n\nFarley added that the mission looked for \u201cdescopes\u201d to the instrument that would reduce its capabilities but also lower its technical risk and cost. \u201cBasically, there was nothing obvious that could be done,\u201d he said.\n\nThe instrument, mounted on the rover\u2019s arm, carries a set of spectrometers, a camera and a laser to study Martian rocks. Scientists plan to use the instrument to look for minerals or organic material that could be evidence of past Martian life.\n\nFarley, speaking the committee by telecon, that the laser spectrometer component of the instrument is scheduled for delivery to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in this summer for integration onto the spacecraft. There are backup plans, though, including allowing the instrument to be installed on the rover after it is shipped to Cape Canaveral, Florida, next January for a July 2020 launch.\n\nHe didn\u2019t elaborate on the details of the instrument problem but said it had to do with a high-voltage power supply for its laser. \u201cIf I could convey one message to the science community, it is to think deeply about high-voltage power supplies on Mars, because they have been a real problem for us,\u201d he said. \u201cMars is a terrible environment for such voltages, so we have trouble with arcing.\u201d\n\nSHERLOC was one of the reasons cited by NASA for the mission\u2019s cost overrun. The agency, in its full fiscal year 2020 budget request March 18, said problems with another instrument, Planetary Instrument for X-ray Lithochemistry, as well as the rover\u2019s sample caching system, caused the cost growth for the mission.\n\nNASA has not provided further details on that cost growth. During a NASA town hall meeting at the 50th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference March 18, Lori Glaze, director of NASA\u2019s planetary science division, said the cost growth was less than 15 percent of the overall cost \u2014 $2.1 billion plus $300 million for its first Martian year of operations \u2014 and that the costs would largely come out of other parts of the overall Mars program. The agency\u2019s fiscal year 2019 operating plan, yet to be released, will contain details of those costs.\n\nOther aspects of the mission are faring well. The heat shield that will protect the rover during entry into the Martian atmosphere had to be rebuilt after the original unit cracked during testing last year. \u201cThe new build in on schedule,\u201d he said, and is scheduled for delivery this summer. Mechanical actuators for various parts of the rover, components that caused problems for the development of the Curiosity rover, have all been delivered to JPL.\n\nA key part of the Mars 2020 mission will be to cache samples of Martian rocks and soil for return to Earth by future missions. As planning begins for those future missions, Farley said there\u2019s some reconsideration about what Mars 2020 will do with those samples.\n\nPrevious planning called for the rover to leave the sample canisters on the surface as it roved, requiring a future mission to pick them up with its own rover. Farley said that the mission is now thinking of going back to its original plans to carry the cached samples on the rover.\n\n\u201cWe are having interactions with the group of people that are thinking about how to actually do that,\u201d he said of planning for collecting and returning samples. \u201cIn particular, how can Mars 2020 best handle its sample cache? Is it best to leave them in one place, or in multiple places, or to have the samples on board and potentially participate in a handoff?\u201d\n\nFarely added there\u2019s no urgency in selecting a method for caching samples. \u201cThe beauty of this design is that none of that matters now, because the hardware is capable of doing any combination of carrying everything or putting everything on the ground or splitting it up,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to commit one way or another basically until the moment when we either put them down or we don\u2019t when we\u2019re on Mars.\u201d",

    "text": "LONDON \u2014 BMW's Mini plant in Britain is closing for four weeks starting Monday in a move planned over a half year ago to help the company deal with any disruption resulting from Brexit, which has since been delayed.\n\nThe German carmaker, which builds just over 15 percent of Britain's 1.5 million cars, moved its annual summertime shutdown to April to \"minimize the risk of any possible short-term parts-supply disruption in the event of a no-deal Brexit.\"\n\n\n\nBut Britain's departure from the EU has now been pushed back from March 29 until at least April 12 or potentially much later, scuppering the timing of major contingency plans for some carmakers.\n\nShutdowns are organized far in advance so employee holidays can be scheduled and suppliers can adjust volumes, making them hard to move.\n\n\"This is what our company and our workforce have planned for over many months, and it is fixed into our business planning,\" said a BMW spokesman.\n\nIt represents the latest headache for Britain's once roaring car sector which had been on track for record production but since 2017 has posted sharp falls in sales, output and investment.\n\nThe overwhelmingly foreign-owned industry has become increasingly incredulous as a stable and attractive investment environment descends into one of its deepest political crises, risking the free and frictionless trade the sector relies on.\n\nBMW's Rolls-Royce factory in Goodwood will close for two weeks whilst Jaguar Land Rover's (JLR) three car plants and engine facility and Honda's Swindon facility will also shut for a few days this month as part of Brexit contingencies.\n\nIt has been a turbulent few months for the sector after Nissan canceled plans to build a new sport utility vehicle at its English Sunderland plant and Honda said it would shutter its plant in 2021 in the biggest blow to the sector for years.\n\nToyota provided a rare boost when it announced plans to build cars for Suzuki at its English car plant.\n\nBMW, which is also closing its central English Hams Hall engine facility and Swindon press shop and sub-assembly site for four weeks, has said it could move some engine and Mini output out of Britain if there is not an orderly Brexit.\n\nCarmakers face a number of risks if there is a disorderly Brexit, including delays to the supply of ports and finished models, new customs bureaucracy, the need to recertify models and an up to 10 percent tariff on finished vehicles.\n\nA series of investment decisions are coming up, including whether Peugeot's parent company PSA will keep its Ellesmere Port plant open and if it will build electric vans at its southern English Luton facility.\n\nPetrochemicals firm Ineos is also due to choose the location for its off-roader whilst a decision is pending on whether JLR will build electric vehicles in its home market.",

    "text": "President Donald Trump on Monday will ask the U.S. Congress for an additional $8.6 billion to help pay for his promised wall on the U.S-Mexico border to combat illegal immigration and drug trafficking, officials familiar with his 2020 budget request told Reuters.\n\nThe demand, which drew swift criticism from Democrats, is more than six times what Congress allocated for border projects in each of the past two fiscal years, and 6 percent more than Trump has corralled by invoking emergency powers this year.\n\nWATCH: Ed Markey cautions against allowing Trump to push ahead with emergency declaration\n\nDemocrats, who oppose the wall as unnecessary and immoral, control the U.S. House of Representatives, making it unlikely the Republican president\u2019s request will win congressional passage. Republicans control the Senate.\n\nThe proposal comes on the heels of a bruising battle with Congress over wall funding that resulted in a five-week partial federal government shutdown that ended in January, and could touch off a sequel just ahead of a trifecta of ominous fiscal deadlines looming this fall.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump hurt millions of Americans and caused widespread chaos when he recklessly shut down the government to try to get his expensive and ineffective wall,\u201d said Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer in a joint statement on Sunday.\n\n\u201cCongress refused to fund his wall and he was forced to admit defeat and reopen the government. The same thing will repeat itself if he tries this again. We hope he learned his lesson,\u201d said the two top Democrats in Congress.\n\nWATCH: White House says 2020 budget requests $8.6B for border wall\n\nAsked on Fox News Sunday about the new wall funding request and if there would be another budget fight, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said, \u201cI suppose there will be \u2026 He\u2019s going to stay with his wall and he\u2019s going to stay with the border security theme. I think it\u2019s essential.\u201d\n\nBroadly speaking on the budget, Kudlow told Fox, \u201cThe president is proposing roughly a 5 percent across-the-board reduction in domestic spending accounts.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Donald Trump\u2019s budget to request big funds for border wall, Space Force\n\nRegardless of whether Congress passes it, the budget request could help Trump frame his argument on border security as the 2020 presidential race begins to take shape, with the president seeking re-election.\n\n\u201cBuild the wall\u201d was one of his signature campaign pledges in his first run for office in 2016. \u201cFinish the wall\u201d is already a feature of his re-election campaign, a rallying cry plastered across banners and signs at his campaign rallies.\n\n\u201cIt gives the president the ability to say he has fulfilled his commitment to gain operational control of the southwest border,\u201d an administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said of the budget request.\n\nWATCH: Feb. 18 \u2014 Protests held across U.S. in opposition to Trump\u2019s national emergency\n\n\u201cWe have provided the course of action, the strategy and the request to finish the job. It\u2019s a question of, will Congress allow us to finish the job,\u201d a second administration official said.\n\nFunding legislation needs to be passed before Oct. 1 \u2013 the start of the 2020 federal fiscal year \u2013 or the government could shut down again. If Congress and the White House fail to agree to lift mandatory spending caps set in a 2011 law, steep automatic cuts in many programs would kick in. Around the same time, Trump and lawmakers must agree to lift the debt ceiling, or risk a default, which would have chaotic economic fallout.\n\n722 miles of wall\n\nTrump\u2019s wall request is based off a 2017 plan put forward by Customs and Border Protection officials to build or replace 722 miles (1,162 km) of barrier along the border, which in total is estimated to cost about $18 billion.\n\nSo far, only 111 miles (179 km) have been built or are under way, officials said. In fiscal 2017, $341 million in funding was allocated for 40 miles (64 km) of wall, and in 2018, another $1.375 billion was directed to 82 miles (132 km).\n\nFor fiscal 2019, Trump demanded $5.7 billion in wall funds, but Congress appropriated only $1.375 billion for border fencing projects.\n\nREAD MORE: Judge my order Trump admin to reunite more migrant families separated at Mexico border\n\nFollowing the rejection of his wall funding demand, Trump declared the border was a national emergency \u2013 a move opposed by Democrats and some Republicans \u2013 and redirected $601 million in Treasury Department forfeiture funds, $2.5 billion in Defense Department drug interdiction funds and $3.6 billion from a military construction budget, for total spending of $8.1 billion for the wall.\n\nThe administration has not estimated how far the 2019 funds will go, but officials said average costs are about $25 million per mile (1.6 km).\n\nTrump\u2019s $8.6 billion in proposed wall funding for fiscal 2020 would include $5 billion from the Department of Homeland Security budget and $3.6 billion from the Pentagon\u2019s military construction budget. The budget proposal will also include another $3.6 million in military construction funding to make up for any projects delayed by the wall, officials said.\n\nWATCH: Feb. 17 \u2014 U.S. lawmakers warn Trump \u2019emergency\u2019 sets dangerous precedent\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security is one of a few priority areas to get a boost in Trump\u2019s budget plan, which seeks to slash funding to many non-defense programs.\n\nTrump will propose an overall 5 percent increase to the Department of Homeland Security budget over fiscal 2019 appropriations, including $3.3 billion, or 22 percent more, for Customs and Border Protection, and $1.2 billion more for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a 16 percent hike, officials said.\n\nThe budget proposal includes a plan to hire more than 2,800 law enforcement and support personnel for the agencies, and 100 immigration judge teams, officials said.\n\nTrump faces both political and court battles to free up the money he wants for the current fiscal year. Many lawmakers accused Trump of overstepping his constitutional powers by declaring an emergency to free up the funds. The House has already voted to revoke the emergency, and the Senate is likely to do the same this week. Trump is expected to veto the resolution.\n\nA coalition of state governments led by California has sued Trump to block the emergency move, though legal experts have said the lawsuits face a difficult road.",

    "description": "Taxpayers thought they might see bigger refunds because of the Trump tax cut.",
    "text": "The average 2018 refund is up, according to the latest IRS accounting, after a sharp decrease at the start of tax season surprised taxpayers expecting to see more benefits from the Trump tax cut.\n\nFour weeks into the tax filing season, the most recent IRS numbers, from Feb. 22, showed the average tax refund had increased by 1.3 percent over last year's -- $3,143. A few weeks before, the statistics showed an 8 percent decrease in the average tax refund compared to 2017.\n\nThe 35-day government shutdown earlier this year and sweeping changes to tax laws at first made it difficult for the IRS to explain the fluctuation.\n\nExperts said that the tax cut meant people saw more in their paychecks over the course of the year because the Treasury Department and the IRS lowered the amount that could be withheld after the 2017 tax reforms.\n\nA smaller withholding would predictably lead to a lower refund, which, in some cases, could put people in a position where they'll owe money, said Leigh Osofsky, a tax law professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law.\n\nA statement now on the IRS website says the lack of data so early in the tax season also made it hard to pinpoint what caused the initial decrease in refunds.\n\n\"There are many factors that impact refunds on a weekly basis that will normalize over time and lead to useful conclusions,\" the statement reads.\n\nWhile the average refund amount has increased from the 2017 tax year, the data show that fewer people have filed their tax returns so far (4.8 percent fewer compared to last year) and that the total amount given in refunds has decreased (3.6 percent less than in 2018).\n\nMark Mazur, director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, a leading independent analyst group, points to changes in tax laws resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that congressional Republicans passed and Trump signed at the end of 2017. The changes make it harder to predict people's behavior and how they will interact with a new system, he said.\n\n\"The new tax law has made it harder for people to get it together,\" he said. \"As we have seen from people's reactions, especially on Twitter asking why their refunds have changed.\"\n\nVisits to the IRS website have increased by 9.1 percent since last year as people continue to try and navigate the new tax system. Approximately 80 percent of all Americans who file taxes expect to receive a refund from the government in 2019.",

    "description": "The airline's first flights to Hawaii begin in March from Oakland to Honolulu. One-way fares start at $49.",
    "text": "CLOSE Southwest Airlines has received FAA approval to begin its long-awaited Hawaii flights. USA TODAY\n\nSouthwest Airlines has started selling tickets to Hawaii, with the first flights taking off March 17.\n\nThe initial flights will be between Oakland and Honolulu, with additional flights from Oakland and flights between San Jose and Honolulu, Kona and Maui added in April and May. Tickets are available on Southwest's website for the new routes.\n\nIntroductory fares started at $49 one way for travel into mid-June, according to Southwest's website. The cheapest fares were available on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, but as of 12:30 p.m. ET, the $49 tickets were sold out with limited other cheap fares left. Fares for peak summer travel range from $189-$214 each way. The airline didn't formally announced the start of ticket sales but quietly launched a Hawaii ticket portal.\n\nSouthwest has a low-fare calendar to help find the cheapest fare.\n\nThe starting dates for other Hawaii routes, according to Southwest's website are:\n\nOakland-Maui: April 7\n\nOakland-Kona May 12\n\nSan Jose-Honolulu: May 5\n\nSan Jose-Kona: May 12\n\nSan Jose-Maui: May 26\n\nMore: 12 things travelers need to know about Southwest flights to Hawaii\n\nSouthwest last year announced that it planned to fly to Hawaii from four California cities: San Diego, Sacramento, San Jose and Oakland.\n\nThe long-awaited details come after the airline received Federal Aviation Administration approval for long over-water flights last week. The last major hurdle \u2014 six test flights to and from Hawaii \u2014 was cleared on Feb. 19.\n\nStart the day smarter: Get USA TODAY's Daily Briefing in your inbox\n\nSouthwest, the nation's largest domestic carrier, is a late entrant to Hawaii. A slew of competitors already fly nonstop flights between the mainland and Hawaii, with a heavy concentration in California, Southwest's initial target.\n\nTravelers hope Hawaii flight competition brings down prices\n\nHawaiian Airlines offers daily nonstop flights from Los Angeles, Long Beach, San Francisco, Oakland, San Diego, San Jose and Sacramento, California. Alaska Airlines offers nearly 30 daily flights from the West Coast to Hawaii, including flights from San Diego, Los Angeles, Oakland, San Francisco, Sacramento and San Jose.\n\nTravelers have been hoping Southwest's market entrance brings fares down, especially during popular vacation periods like spring break, summer and Christmas break. Fares between California and Hawaii often drop below $300 round trip during fare sales for low-season travel, but peak summer fares on nonstop flights to Hawaii are routinely $650-$800+ out of the airports Southwest is initially targeting. (Southwest is not initially offering flights to Hawaii from Los Angeles or San Francisco, where there is more competition.)\n\nA Southwest Airlines Boeing 737-800 is seen in Honolulu with celebrating employees after the carrier\u2019s first-ever touchdown in the Hawaiian Islands on Feb. 5, 2019. The flight was part of a certification effort needed to begin passenger service. (Photo: Southwest Airlines)\n\nSouthwest has talked about flights to Hawaii \u2014 a top destination for travelers hoarding frequent-flier points on any airline \u2014 for years and formally announced plans to begin Hawaii service in October 2017. It has dribbled out details since. Last year, the airline said it planned to serve four islands in Hawaii: Oahu, home to Honolulu; Maui, Kauai and the Big Island of Hawaii, home to Kona.\n\nHawaii service was delayed because of government shutdown\n\nSouthwest initially dangled the prospect of flights beginning in late 2018.\n\nSouthwest executives said the airline was nearing the final phase of its efforts to get so-called ETOPS (extended range twin engine operational performance standards) certification from the FAA, with flights due to start Feb. 1, when the federal government shut down a few days before Christmas.\n\nETOPs certification, a lengthy process involving new flight manuals and procedures, training and exercises and test flights with FAA officials, is required for twin-engine planes on routes where alternate airports aren't in close range should flight troubles arise.\n\nSouthwest Chief Operating Officer Mike Van de Ven said on Jan. 24 that the government shutdown put the Hawaii flights approval process at a \"total standstill.''\n\nHe said Southwest had a shot at beginning flights by the end of March if the shutdown ended within a week but otherwise it wouldn't be able to start flights until April at the earliest. The shutdown ended Jan. 25, a Friday.\n\nSouthwest and the FAA resumed their ETOPS activities the next week, and Southwest's first Hawaii proving flight, from Oakland to Honolulu, was on Feb. 5. Exercises with the FAA took place in Dallas the week of Feb. 11, and daily test flights began later that week. Those flights included a diversion to Hilo, on the Big Island, on a Saturday flight from Oakland to Honolulu, according to flight tracker FlightAware.\n\nThe airline's last test flight was a flight from Maui to Dallas on Tuesday, Feb. 19. Southwest has no plans to fly from its Dallas home base to Hawaii but had flown from Oakland to Maui a day earlier.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/flights/2019/03/04/southwest-airlines-hawaii-flights-tickets/2914903002/",

    "text": "New Delhi: The Bharatiya Janata Party leadership continues to ramp up a communal campaign.\n\nA day after the Dadri lynch case accused were spotted sitting in the front row of a BJP rally addressed by UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath in Dadri\u2019s Bishahra village, Narendra Modi accused the Congress of portraying the \u201cpeace-loving\u201d Hindu society as \u201cterrorists\u201d in front of the world.\n\nTaking a swipe at Rahul Gandhi\u2019s decision to contest from a second seat (Kerala\u2019s Wayanad), Modi at a rally in Wardha said, \u201cThe Congress insulted Hindus. People have decided to punish it in the election. Leaders of that party are now scared of contesting from constituencies dominated by majority (Hindu) population.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs there a single incident in the history of thousands of years of Hindus engaging in terrorism?\u201d the prime minister asked.\n\nSince a special National Investigative Agency court last week acquitted Swami Aseemanand and others accused of conspiracy in the Samjhauta Express blasts, the BJP top brass has harped on how Hindu society will never forgive the Congress for leveraging the slogan of \u201cHindu terror\u201d to get votes.\n\nAdding yet another communal campaign strand, Adityanath at Sunday\u2019s Bishahra rally said, \u201cHow shamelessly the Samajwadi government suppressed the emotions of the villagers. I can proudly say that after BJP formed government in UP, we immediately ordered the shutdown of all illegal slaughterhouses in the state.\u201d\n\nNDA nominee Thusar Vellappally to fight Rahul Gandhi in Wayanad\n\nWayanad is all set for a three-cornered fight between Rahul Gandhi, P.P. Suneer of the Communist Party of India (CPI) and BJP nominee Thusar Vellappally, a leader of the Bharath Dharma Jana Sena.\n\n\u201cA vibrant and dynamic youth leader, he represents our commitment towards development and social justice,\u201d tweeted Amit Shah. \u201cWith him, NDA will emerge as Kerala\u2019s political alternative.\u201d\n\nIn December 2015, Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam, a social organisation representing the backward Ezhava community, launched Bharat Dharma Jana Sena \u2013 a new political party. \u201cThe aim of the party is not to make a Hindu rashtra. This is a secular party,\u201d SNDP general secretary Vellapally Natesan, the father of Thusar Vellappally, said at the launch of the new outfit.\n\nThe decision to field Rahul Gandhi from Wayanad has injected fresh confusion into opposition ranks. Making his displeasure clear, Kerala\u2019s CPI(M) chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan yesterday said the party is not treating Gandhi\u2019s fight from Wayanad as merely symbolic.\n\nFar from projecting a watertight anti-BJP front, the opposition camp stands split into more ways than one. State and national level pulls and tensions have taken sway over politics of conviction.\n\nIt\u2019s official: Kejriwal-Rahul go separate ways\n\nMeanwhile, ending months of back and forth on the possibility of an AAP-Congress alliance, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday told reporters at the Vishakhapatnam airport that the final word has been spoken. Congress president Rahul Gandhi has rejected a tie-up with AAP. \u201cWe have met Rahul Gandhi. Dikshit (Sheila) is not that important a leader,\u201d Kejriwal said.\n\nAlso read: Why Nishad Party Broke Off Its Alliance With Samajwadi Party in UP\n\nThe split in anti-BJP votes is going to dampen chances of what could possibly have been a clean Congress-AAP sweep of Delhi\u2019s seven parliament seats. The alliance talk was fuelled by the fact that Congress and AAP had jointly polled more votes than the BJP in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. Boosted by a fractured opposition, the BJP finally ended up bagging all seven seats.\n\nOpposition-EC continue to squabble over VVPAT\n\nThe EVM-VVPAT spat is showing no signs of dying down. On Monday, the Supreme Court responded to a petition sponsored by 21 opposition parties, urging that 50% EVM results should be matched and cross-checked by Voter Verifiable paper Audit Trail (VVPAT). The court has asked the opposition to file their reply within a week.\n\nAlso read: Petition in Sikkim HC Wants EC to Ensure Elections Are Held as Per the Constitution\n\nIn its affidavit to the court, the Election Commission stated the Lok Sabha Election results would be delayed by six whole days if the opposition\u2019s demand for cross checking was to be met.\n\nThe next hearing in the matter will be on April 8.\n\nCongress plays prank, furnishing spoof BJP manifesto on April 1\n\nBringing some relief into the ongoing acidic poll campaign, Congress on April Fool\u2019s Day put out a spoof manifesto titled \u201cEk Bharat, Berozgaar Bharat (One India, Jobless India)\u201d \u2013 \u201cchowkidar chor hai (the watchman is a thief)\u201d. Poking fun at the Modi government and its all promises, the spoof manifesto inverted the BJP\u2019s lotus symbol and changed the party\u2019s name to \u201cBharatiya Jumla Party\u201d.\n\nThey really have put in a lot of thought.

    "title": "Trump wants a border wall. Texas may want a smarter alternative - CNET",
    "description": "President Trump says a physical wall needs to be the main line of defense in the south. But a visit to several border towns in Texas shows that isn\u2019t necessarily the case.",
    "text": "Marcos Rios spent 10 hours on a cold Monday in February waiting for the start of Donald J. Trump's rally in El Paso, Texas. Holding a fluorescent green handwritten sign with the words \"Trump Por Vida\" -- or \"Trump for Life\" -- Rios was there to see the man in person and hear his plans for a border wall. He voted for the 45th president in 2016 and will again in 2020.\n\nEven so, he doesn't get Trump's wall.\n\nEnlarge Image Amy Kim/CNET\n\n\"It might deter some people, but it's not going to work,\" says Rios, a 59-year-old school bus driver from El Paso. \"They already have tunnels. If you wanna come here, you're gonna come here.\"\n\nTexas has become ground zero in the border wall war. Rios wants a solution to drug trafficking and illegal immigration but questions whether a physical barrier along the US-Mexico border is needed. He's not the only Texan who thinks so. While the state overwhelmingly voted for Trump in 2016 and thousands of people cheered the president on at the El Paso rally, interviews with Texans who'll have to live and deal with a concrete wall or steel barrier -- plus a mix of drones, high-tech cameras, sensors, license plate scanners and other digital surveillance systems -- say the wall may be a hard sell.\n\nJames Martin/CNET\n\n\"We all want to have security in various ways and the border included,\" says John Ferguson, the mayor of Presidio, a border town east of El Paso. \"But Trump's wall would make the United States a big, gated community.\"\n\nThe president's El Paso rally was his first in 2019 -- and the first after a 35-day government shutdown over his request for $5.7 billion from US taxpayers to fund a border wall. Trump didn't pick El Paso for his latest wall pitch by accident. A high desert city of 685,000 people located on the western-most edge of Texas, El Paso is separated from Mexico by the narrow Rio Grande River. It's a major port of entry where immigrants have crossed into the US for decades. It's also where nearly four miles of a new 18-foot steel bollard wall was installed over the last six months.\n\n\"You have thousands and thousands of people coming from Guatemala, from Honduras and El Salvador, and they march up through Mexico,\" Trump boomed into the microphone at the rally. \"If we didn't have walls in those areas \u2026 in many cases where our great military helped us with barbed wire, you would have people pouring in.\"\n\nTrump's wall would make the United States a big, gated community. John Ferguson, mayor of Presidio, Texas\n\nFast-forward a month and Trump's wall proposal keeps feeding a political firestorm, even while data shows illegal immigration is at a historical low. Not only was the wall the cause of the government shutdown, but it also prompted lawsuits, protests and a constitutional dispute over what constitutes a national emergency. Last week, Trump, 72, asked for another $8.6 billion in wall funding in a federal budget proposal that was almost immediately dismissed by his critics. Yet, the president is determined to expand border walls. For the first time in his two-year tenure, Trump used his veto power to reject a congressional resolution that says there's no national emergency at the southern border.\n\nIf all goes according to Trump's current plans, roughly 550 miles of wall will be built along the nearly 2,000-mile-long US-Mexico border as soon as possible. The majority of this construction is expected to happen in Texas. Unlike California, Arizona and New Mexico, which already have about 60 percent of fencing or walls at their borders, Texas only has around 20 percent because of its natural barrier with Mexico: the Rio Grande River.\n\nThe slow-moving, silty-green river serves as the official southern border for the entire state. Starting in El Paso, it bends and winds through the mountains of the Chihuahuan Desert into Big Bend National Park's 1,500-foot-deep canyons, then through the grapefruit orchards and cotton crops of the Rio Grande Valley. Eventually, the river empties out through a sandy beach into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nJames Martin/CNET\n\nI set out to travel the length of the Texas-Mexico border, more than 1,200 miles, to find out how the wall -- and surveillance technology -- will affect those living along the river. Such a barrier is expected to drastically change the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. Local sheriffs and US Border Patrol agents say they've already been using technology to police the region for decades. And now, they're finding themselves in the middle of a major Silicon Valley-style shakeup.\n\nDespite Trump's insistence on a physical barrier, politicians throughout Texas are touting new technology as an alternative to physical walls. They're calling out everything from seismic sensors to lidar and fiber-optic cables as a partial solution for stopping drug cartels and stemming unwanted immigration. A \"smart wall,\" they say, will be cheaper, more effective and do a better job of helping Border Patrol agents than a concrete or steel barrier.\n\n\"We can't double down on a third-century approach to solve 21st century problems,\" Rep. Will Hurd, a Republican whose district covers more than 800 miles of the Texas-Mexico border, said in a statement. \"It's time to harness American innovation.\"\n\nThe smart wall\n\nPresidio County is southeast of El Paso and smack in the middle of the Chihuahuan Desert, a nearly 140,000-square-mile expanse that stretches across the southwestern US and northern Mexico. Here, the high plains give way to hazy, yellowish mountains devoid of trees and full of cactus, rattlesnakes and rocky cliffs.\n\nDespite the empty, wind-swept feeling of Presidio County, it's a hotbed of high-tech border security initiatives.\n\nNow playing: Watch this: Not all Texans want a border wall\n\nThe federal government is pouring money into smart wall technology. The Department of Homeland Security earmarked $975.8 million for border tech in its 2018 budget proposal and $223 million in its 2019 budget proposal.\n\nThe government already employs many of the same tools at the border the US military uses in war zones -- from tethered surveillance blimps called aerostats, that cost about $8.9 million each, to $16 million Predator B drones equipped with radar strong enough to detect footprints in the sand.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security is now in talks to fly smaller unmanned drones on nighttime border missions out of the Marfa Airport in Presidio County, according to Airports Director Chase Snodgrass. Called the RQ-7 Shadow, made by AAI Corporation, this drone uses an array of cameras, lasers and radars to \"locate, recognize and identify targets\" up to 75 miles away. It then beams that information back to a ground control station. The devices have been used in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nBut to deploy the drones, the airport will have to close for hour-long blocks of time amid daily takeoffs and landings. That's rankled residents.\n\n\"Let's just say I haven't had anybody local call me and say it was a great idea,\" Snodgrass says. \"But I've had quite a few calling to say they don't like it.\"\n\nDara Kerr/CNET\n\nDrones are just the beginning when it comes to high-tech border surveillance. The government is working with more than 30 tech companies to develop tools for national security. That's everything from lidar systems, which is the same laser light technology used in self-driving cars that measures the distance to a target, to machine-learning AI software to Bluetooth and Wi-Fi sensors that can measure a crowd's behavior and movement.\n\nAnduril may be the best-known of these companies. Its creator, Palmer Luckey, founded the virtual reality company Oculus that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg bought for nearly $3 billion in 2014. Luckey left Facebook in 2017 after it was revealed he funded a pro-Trump group working to influence the 2016 election.\n\nNamed after a magical sword in Lord of the Rings, Anduril says its goal is to be the future of defense. Using a system it calls Lattice, the company can process inputs from hundreds of thousands of sensors strategically placed along the border -- including 20-megapixel visual cameras, thermal cameras and radar -- and then use artificial intelligence to instantaneously interpret that data.\n\nFor example, Lattice can continuously monitor one stretch of desert and the moment it detects anything out of the ordinary, like a vehicle pulling over or a group of people walking, Border Patrol will be alerted.\n\nWe can't look at defending our border in a static way, because the threat is dynamic. Congressman Will Hurd\n\nAnduril has a contract with US Customs and Border Protection in California and is testing its tech on a private ranch in West Texas.\n\nThe rancher had cartel traffic crossing his land, the company says, so he let Anduril give Lattice a whirl. In the first few months, the system led to the capture of 39 migrants crossing the border, along with 16 drug smugglers carrying 982 pounds of marijuana, according to a report by Wired.\n\nAnduril says this rancher no longer has problems with cartel traffic because the system now works as a deterrent. The company confirmed these details but declined to comment further.\n\nWhen Hurd talks about a smart wall, it's tech like Anduril's he envisions. He sees the digital barrier beaming real-time info to Border Patrol agents' smartphones about every drug trafficker and human smuggler who crosses the international boundary.\n\n\"We always have to remember the enemy adapts,\" says Hurd, a former CIA officer who now sits on the House Intelligence Committee. \"That's why we can't look at defending our border in a static way, because the threat is dynamic.\"\n\nJames Martin/CNET\n\nIt's hard to escape the impression the border is being militarized, which is why groups like the American Civil Liberties Union warn that smart wall tech could have serious privacy implications. The ACLU says allowing the Department of Homeland Security \"to track, surveil and monitor individuals indiscriminately and with precise detail\" could lead to intrusions on the most intimate aspects of Americans' lives.\n\nBut Hurd and the Silicon Valley companies working on border security say a smart wall is fundamental to protecting the border. Even so, it's unlikely that will sway the president.\n\n\"They can have all the drones they want flying up in the air and spinning around, and all the technology in the world. It's all -- I call it 'bells and whistles,'\" Trump said during a Christmas video teleconference. \"But if you don't have the wall, it doesn't work.\"\n\nEmergency on the border\n\nCurious what locals think about Trump's wall, I head to the dusty little border town of Presidio -- the only place to legally cross between the US and Mexico for hundreds of miles. About 4,000 people live here, mostly in single-story homes where dogs bark from behind chain-link fences. This is the land of pickup trucks and red enchiladas.\n\nMayor Ferguson, a friendly, soft-spoken 55-year-old with thick brown hair full of cowlicks, offers to be my tour guide. He's been the mayor on and off for about nine years and has worked in local public schools most of his adult life.\n\nWe start by walking over the international bridge. A few elderly women with shopping bags and young men on bicycles make their way back and forth between the US and Mexico, but it's mostly empty. Down below, the Rio Grande cuts between Presidio and its sister city, Ojinaga. The river is narrow enough here that you can throw a rock and hit the other side.\n\nDara Kerr/CNET\n\n\"What you'll find along the Texas border is people who've lived here forever,\" Ferguson explains. \"Most of the water you see is coming out of Mexico. A lot of people use that water.\"\n\nI ask him where the wall would go if Trump's plans fall into place. He sighs deeply and just says, \"Yeah\u2026\"\n\nAfter a few moments, he points to the banks of the river on the US side and says, \"You could run it along the levy. But then you look here and the levy curves and so you say, 'OK, now what?'\n\n\"It's not so simple that you're going to build this big wall,\" he adds. \"If we were to build a wall, we'd lose our own river.\"\n\nThe idea of a border wall long predates President Trump. The US has been putting up barriers along its southern border for the last century. After President Bill Clinton signed the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994, 18 miles of wall were added. After 9/11, President George W. Bush spearheaded plans for an additional 523 miles, much of which was built during President Barack Obama's tenure.\n\nToday, 654 miles of the 1,954-mile US-Mexico border -- about a third of the distance -- has some sort of wall or fencing. The areas without any wall tend to have natural barriers, like mountains or the Rio Grande. So far, no new miles of Trump's proposed 18-to-30 foot wall have been constructed. But at least 40 miles of replacement wall -- like the new steel barrier in El Paso -- have been added.\n\nJames Martin/CNET\n\nKeeping up with the daily back-and-forth of whether a wall will be built is dizzying.\n\nTo recap what's been going on the past several weeks: Congress passed a spending measure in mid-February to avoid another government shutdown. Trump signed the measure, which would pay $1.375 billion for 55 miles of steel fencing, but he was unhappy with the deal. So the following day he announced an unprecedented national emergency that would allow him to tap into more than $6 billion additional funds to build the wall. The money would be diverted from other government reserves, like a military construction fund and a military antidrug account.\n\nWithin days of Trump's declaration, lawsuits were filed challenging his use of emergency powers. One of those suits was brought by a coalition of 16 US states. In the suits, lawyers cited Trump's own announcement on the national emergency.\n\n\"I could do the wall over a longer period of time,\" Trump said. \"I didn't need to do this. But I'd rather do it much faster.\"\n\nOn March 14, Congress passed a resolution to terminate the president's national emergency. One day later, Trump vetoed that resolution. The legislation now heads back to Congress where the resolution's supporters need to get enough votes to override the president's veto.\n\nIf we were to build a wall, we'd lose our own river. John Ferguson, Presidio mayor\n\nWhile it's unclear how Washington's battle will shake out, a lot of people in Texas are left scratching their heads.\n\n\"Here we stand at the international border, and there's no wall and there's no people crossing the river,\" Ferguson says, looking down at the water below. \"You'd think if there was an emergency going on there'd be all sorts of people here to apprehend. But there's not.\"\n\n'We see everything'\n\nIn Brewster County, just south of Presidio, I meet with the local sheriff. Brewster County is cowboy country. Known for vast cattle ranches and tabletop mesas, it's the biggest county in Texas -- almost equal in size to Connecticut. It's also the most rural with just 9,000 residents.\n\nFrigid winds blow across its inhospitable landscape throughout the winter, and scorching desert sun cracks its earth in the summer. Surviving out here is no easy feat. Locals say an unspoken policy is to leave your home unlocked so traveling migrants can go in, get water and not break the windows.\n\nDara Kerr/CNET\n\nSheriff Ronny Dodson's office is in a quaint red-brick building that used to be the county jail. He looks the part of a Texan sheriff: tall, with broad shoulders, a cowboy hat and a woven leather gun holster. Dodson's family has been in Brewster Country for six generations stretching back before the Mexican Revolution. Pancho Villa's rebel group once famously raided his great grandfather's ranch, forcing his family into hiding.\n\nWhile the Border Patrol's job is to catch people entering the US illegally, a lot of that work also falls under Dodson's jurisdiction. That's because Brewster County, with its 192 border miles, has more border territory than any other county in the US.\n\n\"The president is going to El Paso and he went to McAllen, those are big places,\" Dodson says, taking off his cowboy hat to smooth down his hair. \"It's different out here.\"\n\nHe regularly catches small groups of people walking through the desert with more than 100-pound backpacks of drugs -- marijuana being the main drug he finds. He also apprehends immigrants coming to the US. But, he says, they're not pouring in.\n\n\"This country has a hunger for cheap labor and a hunger for narcotics,\" Dodson says. \"As long as we have that hunger, they're coming.\"\n\n\"This country has a hunger for cheap labor and a hunger for narcotics. As long as we have that hunger, they're coming. Ronny Dodson, Brewster County sheriff\n\nHe takes out his smartphone to show me photos from hidden cameras that he set up along the border. One photo shows six or seven people in dark blue hoodies huddled behind a mound of dirt. He tells me they are migrants planning to cross the border.\n\n\"They didn't know the camera was there taking pictures of them,\" Dodson says. \"The tech we have now lets us see everything.\"\n\nTo prove his point, he shows me other photos he caught of wild animals, including mountain lions, gray foxes and even Mexican black bears. Along with cameras, Dodson uses handheld drones and buried seismic ground sensors to augment his work. But, unlike federal security agencies, he says state and local law enforcement is limited with how much tech it can use because of lack of funding.\n\n\"We see guys come to our conferences and they set up these magnificent cameras,\" Dodson says, but these cameras cost $500,000. \"There's no way we could afford half a million dollars, not in this county.\"\n\nBrewster County's border is full of natural barriers, including Santa Elena Canyon and its towering cliff walls and the deadly Chihuahuan Desert. A border wall can be practical in places like El Paso and McAllen, Dodson says, but it doesn't make a lot of sense out here.\n\nDara Kerr/CNET\n\nBefore the sheriff shows me one last photo on his phone, he asks, \"Do you have a strong stomach?\"\n\nHe pulls up a picture of a dead migrant that he and his deputies were called to handle last summer. The man is lying in the dirt among the cactus. He isn't wearing a shirt and his bloated body is burned completely black. His face and hands have been eaten away, presumably by insects and animals. Dodson told me it was 120 degrees on the day he found the man.\n\n\"They tear off their clothes when they're dying of thirst, because they think it'll help,\" Dodson says. \"It's pretty terrible what happens to some of these guys.\"\n\nLike a rolling stone\n\nDriving through the desolate desert landscape, I see in the distance a roadblock constructed of orange cones leading to a small green-and-white building. Border Patrol agents wearing army-green uniforms signal me to slow down and stop.\n\n\"Where are you coming from,\" an agent asks, shining his flashlight into the back seat and trunk of my rental car. \"Are you an American citizen?\"\n\nThese checkpoints are all along border highways, and every car coming through is required to stop. A bevy of cameras and sensors usually takes images of people's vehicles, including their license plates. The agents are accompanied by dogs trained to detect drugs.\n\nEnlarge Image Dara Kerr/CNET\n\nThey wave me on after I answer their questions. I'm headed to the central region of the Texas-Mexico border to catch a nighttime ride with Border Patrol agents and see firsthand how Central American asylum seekers are faring after caravanning across Mexico.\n\nWith the barren yellow-hued mountains receding in my rearview mirror, I think back to the Trump rally in El Paso.\n\nAs the president's speech continued into the night, the crowd seemed to lose energy and people began to trickle out of the coliseum. When Trump finally finished after an hour and 20 minutes, he slowly made his way offstage waving, clapping and mouthing \"thank you.\"\n\nMusic rose over the loudspeakers and, as if on cue, the song was the Rolling Stones' You Can't Always Get What You Want.\n\nIn West Texas, that sentiment might come true.\n\nStay tuned for \"Cat and Mouse,\" the second article in our border trilogy.\n\nCorrection, 3:23 p.m.: Fixes formal title of US Customs and Border Protection.",

    "text": "Getty Images The U.S. economy slowed in the fourth quarter and corporate profits fell, paving the way for even slower growth in the first three months of 2019. The government cut fourth-quarter GDP growth to 2.2% from 2.6%.\n\nThe numbers: The economy grew somewhat slower in the final three months of 2018 than it originally appeared, largely because of softer consumer spending and a weaker climate for business investment that\u2019s likely to depress growth in the first quarter as well.\n\nGross domestic product, the official scorecard for the economy, expanded at a 2.2% annual pace in the fourth quarter, the government said Thursday. GDP was marked down from an initial 2.6% estimate.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, adjusted pretax corporate profits fell slightly in the fourth quarter, marking the first decline in almost two years.\n\nEven after the downward revision, however, GDP for all of 2018 was left at 2.9%. That matched 2015 for the best performance since the Great Recession a decade ago.\n\nWhat happened: Consumer spending was lowered to 2.5% from 2.8%, mainly because purchases of recreational vehicles were not as strong as initially reported.\n\nThe increase in business fixed investment, meanwhile, was trimmed to 3.1% from 3.9%. The government lowered its estimate of spending on software and other forms of intellectual property.\n\nThe increase in the value of inventories was little changed at $96.8 billion.\n\nSlower growth weighed on business profits in the fourth quarter. They fell an adjusted 0.4%, the first decline since the first quarter of 2017. Still, earnings climbed a healthy 7.7% in the past year.\n\nState and local spending was another drag. Outlays fell a sharper 1.3% instead of 0.3%.\n\nExports rose a revised 2.8% in the fourth quarter, up from an original 2.6% estimate. The increase in imports was slashed to 2% from 2.7%.\n\nThe rate of inflation, measured by the PCE index, was unaltered at 1.5%. Most other figures in the revised GDP were little changed.\n\nOwing to delays caused by the partial government shutdown early this year, the latest report combines what normally would have been the first and second revisions to GDP.\n\nRead: Why the markets aren\u2019t buying Fed\u2019s claims about the strength of the economy\n\nBig picture: Like a rocket shedding its boosters, the U.S. lost speed in the fourth quarter as key segments of the economy faltered.\n\nThe biggest dropoff came in business investment, the result of a festering trade dispute with China, a stronger dollar DXY, -0.22% that crimped exports and a weaker global economy.\n\nThe boost from the Trump tax cuts and a burst of higher government spending last spring and summer also appeared to fade toward the end of the year.\n\nThe economy has gotten off to a sluggish start in 2019 and that means growth in the first quarter could be even worse. Although many economists think growth will strengthen in the spring, no one is forecasting the sort of huge bounceback that occurred last year when second-quarter GDP hit 4.2%.\n\nRead: The Fed is gun-shy because of a quarter-century of low inflation\n\nMarket reaction: \u201cThe U.S. economy slowed more in the fourth quarter than previously thought, though partly because of the government shutdown,\u201d said senior economist Sal Guatieri of BMO Capital Markets. \u201cThe impact of tax cuts is fading, but the underlying trend in activity still points more to a moderation in growth rather than a recession.\u201d\n\nMarket reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.15% and S&P 500 SPX, +0.21% rose modestly in Thursday trades.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, +1.95% stood at 2.39%. Mortgages, auto loans and other common forms of borrowing are tied to changes in the 10-year note.\n\nThe yield has fallen steadily from a seven-year high of 3.23% in October, reflecting greater worries about the U.S. economy.",

    "description": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom continued his ongoing feud with President Donald Trump on Monday night on CNN.",
    "text": "CLOSE California Gov. Gavin Newsom rebuked President Donald Trump on border security and immigration, with the Democrat saying during his first State of the State that he will withdraw most of the state's National Guard troops from the Mexico border. (Feb. 12) AP\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom has repeatedly used two words to describe Donald Trump\u2019s presidency: Political theater.\n\nThe latest act, Newsom said Monday night on CNN, is Trump\u2019s $8.6 billion request to fund a wall along the country\u2019s border with Mexico, a \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d campaign promise that triggered the longest government shutdown in American history earlier this year.\n\nThe latest salvo in a feud between two of the country\u2019s most influential politicians \u2013 Trump is leader of the free world; Newsom the top elected official in a state he calls \u201cthe world\u2019s most diverse democracy\u201d \u2013 Newsom again slammed Trump\u2019s divisive politics and promised that California would do the job of the federal government to ensure migrants are legally able to seek asylum.\n\nHis appearance on \u201cAC360\u201d came two days after Trump criticized Newsom for dedicating taxpayer money for a new migrant shelter in San Diego County near San Ysidro, the country\u2019s busiest border crossing.\n\nMore: Immigration asylum-seekers have a constitutional right to appeal, says court\n\nMore: 'We need people': Donald Trump says he wants to see more legal immigration in U.S.\n\n\u201cThese are human beings. They\u2019re parents. These are children,\u201d Newsom said Monday night. \u201cThey came through here legally. Legal asylum-seekers. Not here illegally. Legally.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cAnd the federal government turns its back to them, turns a blind eye to them. California will not. If they won\u2019t do their job, we\u2019ll do their job.\u201d\n\nRather than work toward a bipartisan solution on immigration, an approach he said would require \u201creal conversation,\u201d Newsom accused Trump of spinning people \u201cdown the vortex\u201d of his own \u201cpolitical theater.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks as he tours the U.S. border with Mexico at the Rio Grande on the southern border, Thursday, Jan. 10, 2019, in McAllen, Texas, as Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, listens at right. (Photo: Evan Vucci, AP)\n\nTrump\u2019s request for additional border wall funding Monday as part of his 2020 budget proposal is the latest example, Newsom said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pure political theater. It\u2019s a perpetuation of a conversation like you and I are having, that we\u2019re gonna have every single day. It\u2019s exactly what the president wants,\u201d Newsom told Anderson Cooper. \u201cHe wants this conversation because he can\u2019t have the real conversation about solving some of the deep and structural challenges in this country, because he\u2019s not interested enough in creating political conditions where he can engage the other party and actually produce real results.\n\n\u201cSo, he creates these sideshows. This political theater. This political grandstanding,\u201d Newsom continued. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s absurd. Five-point-seven billion dollars led to a shutdown and now he asks for $8.6 (billion)? Doubling down on it. He knows exactly what he\u2019s doing and he knows how we\u2019re going to react \u2026 how it\u2019ll consume the nightly news and, meanwhile, he\u2019ll be less impacted by the consequences of his complete failure to address all these other issues.\u201d\n\nRelated: Could California produce soon cost you more? Farms face labor shortages, immigration woes\n\nMore: Trump immigration policy under scrutiny at four simultaneous congressional hearings\n\nThough Newsom acknowledged that border walls work in \u201curban settings,\u201d he blasted Trump\u2019s greater vision: \u201cA 2,000-mile wall is a monument to stupidity. Not just vanity, to stupidity. It doesn\u2019t solve the problem.\u201d\n\nTrump was equally critical of Newsom last weekend on Twitter, labeling him as \u201cgrandstanding\u201d and calling for lower taxes for California residents.\n\nAs part of his 2019-20 budget, Newsom proposed $20 million to provide aid to migrants through \u201cqualified\u201d humanitarian and non-profit organizations.\n\n\u201cI hope the grandstanding Governor of California is able to spend his very highly taxed citizens money on asylum holds more efficiently than money has been spent on the so-called Fast Train, which is $Billions over budget & in total disarray. Time to reduce taxes in California!\u201d Trump tweeted.\n\nI hope the grandstanding Governor of California is able to spend his very highly taxed citizens money on asylum holds more efficiently than money has been spent on the so-called Fast Train, which is $Billions over budget & in total disarray. Time to reduce taxes in California! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 9, 2019\n\nDespite their political differences, Trump called Newsom a \u201cnice guy\u201d earlier this month during one of his longest addresses as president at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland. He also alleged that Newsom had recently called to praise his leadership and intelligence.\n\n\u201cHe called me up the other day, let\u2019s say four weeks ago or so,\u201d Trump said at CPAC. \u201c[He said] \u2018I just want to tell you, you\u2019re a great president and you\u2019re one of the smartest people I\u2019ve ever met.\u2019 That\u2019s what he said.\u201d\n\nTrump added, \u201cWill he admit it? No, I doubt it.\u201d\n\nIs that how it happened, Cooper asked Monday night.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t make this up, Anderson,\u201d Newsom said with a laugh. He said he called Trump to extend his appreciation for visiting an area of California especially devastated by wildfire last year.\n\n\u201cThe people in those communities were grateful to him; I was grateful to him,\u201d Newsom said, adding that he hopes to \u201crise above his politics\u201d and work with Trump on emergency preparedness and planning efforts.\n\nOn Trump\u2019s recollection of the conversation, Newsom said, \u201cI think we hear what we want to hear. I can\u2019t \u2018admit\u2019 to what I said to the president privately because that\u2019s not what I said.\u201d\n\nThe back-and-forth between Newsom and Trump has been ongoing for months.\n\nIn February, Trump demanded California repay billions to the federal government after Newsom announced plans to downsize the state\u2019s grand plans for the nation\u2019s first high-speed rail train. Newsom\u2019s response: It\u2019s our money and we\u2019re keeping it.\n\nA few days earlier, in his first State of the State address, Newsom defied Trump\u2019s administration by ordering hundreds of National Guard troops off the state\u2019s border with Mexico, accusing Trump of creating a \u201cmanufactured crisis\u201d and stressing that California would not \u201cbe part of this political theater.\u201d\n\nThose comments came a month after Newsom spoke out against \u201ccorruption and incompetence in the White House\u201d during his swearing-in ceremony in Sacramento.\n\nA few days later, Trump threatened via Twitter to \u201csend no more money\u201d to California unless the state gets its \u201cact together\u201d and begins \u201cproper Forest Management.\u201d\n\nWhile campaigning ahead of last November\u2019s midterm elections, Trump labeled Newsom as \u201ca clown\u201d who wants \u201copen borders.\u201d\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/03/11/california-gavin-newsom-president-donald-trump-feud/3137602002/",

    "title": "Trump budget boosts military and border wall",
    "description": "The Republican president's $4.7 trillion budget was immediately panned by Capitol Hill Democrats, who blocked his push for a border wall during a standoff last year that led to a five-week partial shutdown of the federal government.",
    "text": "WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump on Monday called for spending more money on the military and a US-Mexico border wall while overhauling social programs for the poor in a budget plan that sets the stage for his next fight with the US Congress.The Republican President's $4.7 trillion budget was immediately panned by Capitol Hill Democrats, who blocked his push for a border wall during a standoff last year that led to a five-week partial shutdown of the federal government.Like past presidential budget proposals, Trump's plan was highly unlikely to become law, especially with Democrats in control of the House of Representatives. But it does serve as an early manifesto of his 2020 re-election campaign.\"President Trump has somehow managed to produce a budget request even more untethered from reality than his past two,\" said Democratic Representative Nita Lowey, chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee.Democratic senator Patrick Leahy, chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said in a statement that Trump's plan \"is not worth the paper it is printed on.\"This year, the stakes for a deal are higher than in past years. An October 1 deadline to keep the government running coincides with a deadline to lift the debt limit. Without an increase in the limit, the US government would risk a default, which could shock the world economy.Trump's budget includes politically volatile proposals for overhauling Medicare, Medicaid and other costly social programs that form the American social safety net that helps the poor and underprivileged.It asks for $8.6 billion to build a wall on the border with Mexico . That figure is more than six times what Congress gave Trump for border projects in each of the past two fiscal years, and 6 per cent more than he has corralled by invoking emergency powers this year after he failed to get the money he wanted.The spending plan makes no immediate progress on reducing the federal deficit or the national debt.A senior administration official told reporters the budget would cut foreign aid by $13 billion.The proposal also cuts federal subsidies to farmers; adds a new user fee on e-cigarettes; and ends a tax credit for electric car purchases.Trump also calls for defence spending to rise more than 4 per cent to $750 billion, using the emergency Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) account - derided by conservatives as a slush fund - to skirt spending caps set out in a 2011 fiscal restraint law.Non-defence spending was held below those caps, thanks to steep proposed funding cuts to the State Department (23 per cent) and Environmental Protection Agency (31 per cent), among others.Even with the cuts, which the White House said would add up to $2.7 trillion in savings over a decade, the budget office said the Trump plan would not balance until 2034, exceeding the traditional 10-year outlook.Tax cuts have been a priority for the Republican White House and Congress in the past two years, rather than deficit reduction. The deficit ran to $900 billion in 2019 and the national debt has ballooned to $22 trillion.The committee for a responsible budget said Trump's budget would add $10.5 trillion to the debt over a decade, and criticized the White House for what it called a \" fantasy assumption\" of 3 per cent economic growth over that timeframe - higher than the 2 per cent average used by independent forecasters.Unless the White House and Congress reach an agreement, the automatic spending caps from the 2011 law will kick in on October 1, adding another level of urgency to the fall deadlines.The White House wants to shake up the practise of pairing increases in defence spending with a corresponding increase in non-defence spending, a method that has been used to secure contentious funding deals in the past.\"We think we need to break that paradigm. We don't think that that paradigm allows us to be able to get our fiscal house in order,\" Russell Vought, Trump's acting budget director, told reporters.",

    "text": "President Donald Trump\u2019s latest budget is packed with ways the administration wants to curb illegal immigration in the U.S. beyond just the $8.6 billion for his much-desired border wall.\n\nAcross the federal government, the White House plan calls for an all-hands-on-deck approach from increasing the number of officers who can detain and deport undocumented immigrants, to proposing to punish the \u201csanctuary cities\u201d that protect them.\n\nWhile the proposal has almost no chance of passing the Democratic-controlled House, it outlines the administration's priorities for the year and suggests immigration will remain Trump's focal point for the year.\n\n\"All who are privileged to hold elected office must work together to create an immigration system that promotes wage growth and economic opportunity while preventing drugs, terrorism, and crime from entering the United States,\" the budget plan states. \"Immigration policy, like all policy, must serve the interests of Americans living here today\u2014including the millions of new Americans who came here legally to join our national family.\"\n\nOn top of $8.6 billion more for a wall, the White House budget proposal would fund 5,000 new Border Patrol Agents and allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement to add 10,000 officers and investigators while expanding detention centers, according to the White House budget office.\n\nThe budget also would replace military construction funds that would be depleted by the border wall after Trump declared a national emergency.\n\nWhen Trump first took office, ICE facilities held an average of 34,376 people on any given day. Last week that number topped 50,000 and the new proposed budget would allow for further increases.\n\nDemocrats fought detention center expansions in negotiations that ended the government shutdown earlier this year.

Trump\u2019s new proposal increases Justice Department funding to grow the number of immigration judges by nearly 20 percent, the budget office says.\n\nNational Park officers are also expected to crack down on illegal crossings through federal land near the border.\n\n\"We are going to be working ever more intensely with our friends in CBP and the law enforcement agencies to interdict drug smuggling along the border,\" Scott Cameron, a top Interior Department official, said on a call with reporters.\n\nThe Interior Department has more than 4,000 federal law enforcement officers and has been increasingly focused on deploying those resources to the border.\n\n(Alexandre Meneghini/Reuters, FILE) U.S. border patrol agents receive migrants after crossing the Rio Bravo, seen from Piedras Negras, Mexico, Feb. 20, 2019.\n\nThe budget also includes proposals aimed at \u201csanctuary cities.\u201d The measures would allow the administration to withhold funding from cities that don\u2019t \u201ccooperate with specific federal immigration enforcement activities and requests.\u201d\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s efforts to crack down these jurisdictions have been stopped by appellate courts multiple times.\n\nIn resistance to Trump\u2019s plan, advocates joined Democrats on Capitol Hill on Wednesday to introduce new legislation that would protect young immigrants known as \"Dreamers\" and refugees.\n\nThese immigrants \"make our communities stronger \u2014 it\u2019s time we gave them stability, REAL protection under the law, and a pathway toward citizenship,\" tweeted Rep.

Naruhito's father, Emperor Akihito, is abdicating at the end of this month.\n\nThe country already has April 29, and May 3 to May 6 \u2014 known as \"Golden Week\" \u2014 off as regular national public holidays. Together, this makes for 10 consecutive days off.\n\nWhile some citizens are celebrating the extra-long holiday by booking vacations overseas, many others are complaining about the lack of childcare services and having nothing to do.\n\nJapan's Crown Prince Naruhito, who will soon be crowned emperor, at his residence in Tokyo's Togu Palace in February 2019.

    "text": "Rep. Rodney Davis, R-Ill., speaks while flanked by fellow House Republicans during the government shutdown in January. On Thursday, Davis defended his fandom of the band Nickelback. (Photo: Mark Wilson, Getty Images)\n\nWhat started as two members of the House of Representatives debating how to count prison inmates on the U.S. Census turned into a dispute over the band Nickelback on Thursday.\n\nThe conversation occurred on the House floor on Thursday during discussion of an amendment by Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wisc. The amendment, which was added to the broader anti-corruption and government ethics bill expected to pass Friday, would require incarcerated people to be counted as residents of their last place of residence before they went to prison.\n\n\"If we count incarcerated persons as being present at their last-known residence, we know that the right community will receive an appropriate amount of population-based funding,\" he said.\n\nRep. Rodney Davis, R-Ill., opposed the amendment, arguing it doesn't address the \"underlying issues with gerrymandering\" and would overturn the long-held method by which the Census counts prisoners. He added that college students are counted at their dorms and military members at their base. Counting prisoners differently \"only serves to decrease the accuracy of the Census,\" he said.\n\n'Honoring our Democracy': House set to pass a broad anti-corruption and voting rights bill\n\nMore: House overwhelmingly passes resolution condemning hate after Rep. Ilhan Omar's comments\n\nPocan then pulled Nickelback into the debate, saying that in a 2016 Census survey, just four of roughly 77,000 people wanted to keep the current provision of counting prisoners in place.\n\n\"That's probably about the percent of people who think Nickelback is their favorite band in this country. It's pretty low,\" he said, before gesturing to Davis. \"Nickelback is your favorite band? I apologize to the gentleman.\"\n\nDavis then interrupted: \"Why would you criticize one of the greatest bands of the '90s?\"\n\nPocan: \"Wow. Alright. One more reason why there's a difference between Democrats and Republicans.\"\n\nDavis: \"I know he did not mean to offend the many thousands upon thousands of Nickelback fans in his district in Wisconsin. I'll stand here to save you from doing that and have to face the political consequences at the ballot box.\"\n\nDavis then proved he was a fan before recommending that fellow members vote no on the amendment.\n\n\"Yes, I actually do have a Nickelback song on my running playlist that I listen to on a regular basis.\"\n\nIn closing his remarks, Pocan credited Davis for copping to his fondness for the band.\n\n\"I appreciate that very brave admission of your fandom for Nickelback,\" he said.\n\nThe amendment was agreed to by a voice vote.\n\nAfter the debate, Pocan sent one final Nickelback-related missive to his colleague. He tweeted a photo featuring Nickelback's lead singer Chad Kroeger in the video for the band's hit \"Photograph.\" Only this time, the photograph Kroeger holds reads \"Vote 'YES' on H.R. 1\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/03/08/reps-pocan-davis-debate-merits-band-nickelback-house-floor/3102036002/",

And Kudlow said the president is \"going to stay with border security\" moving forward.\n\nAfter agreeing to reopen the government as part of a deal that only included $1.375 billion for border barrier construction, some immigration opponents accused Trump of \"caving\" to Democrats. Conservative author Ann Coulter issued some of the sharpest criticism, calling Trump a \"wimp.\" She even derided his declaration of a national emergency to obtain the funds for a wall as a \"scam.\"\n\nTrump has pushed back against such criticisms. There is little chance Democrats will approve the $8.6 billion, but the request signals to Trump's base, and critics like Coulter, that he intends to keep fighting for the promised wall.\n\n\"Wacky Nut Job @AnnCoulter, who still hasn\u2019t figured out that, despite all odds and an entire Democrat Party of Far Left Radicals against me (not to mention certain Republicans who are sadly unwilling to fight), I am winning on the Border,\" Trump tweeted on Saturday.\n\nCould Calif. produce cost you more?: Farms face labor shortages, immigration woes\n\nWacky Nut Job @AnnCoulter, who still hasn\u2019t figured out that, despite all odds and an entire Democrat Party of Far Left Radicals against me (not to mention certain Republicans who are sadly unwilling to fight), I am winning on the Border.

The southern border is nearly 2,000 miles long. About 700 miles of barriers are already in place, but most of them consist of vehicle barriers and pedestrian fencing.\n\nTrump's concept of what the wall would look like and how many miles it would stretch has changed over time. While he initially wanted a 30-foot wall of solid concrete stretching at least 1,000 miles, Trump has recently favored tall steel slat barriers often referred to as bollard fencing.\n\nContributing: John Fritze\n\n'A WALL is a WALL!': Trump's definition has shifted a lot over time\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/03/10/trump-border-wall-8-6-billion-more-funding/3123288002/",

    "text": "CLOSE President Trump declared a national emergency to free up funding for his border wall between the U.S and Mexico. But declaring a national emergency isn\u2019t new -- in fact, the use of emergency powers is older than the country itself. USA TODAY, Just the FAQs\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump faces a rare defeat Thursday in the GOP-controlled Senate when lawmakers will decide whether to uphold his controversial national emergency to build his proposed border wall, or knock it down.\n\nThe prognosis doesn't look great for Trump.\n\nTrump declared the emergency in February to free up more than $6 billion for the wall \u2013 most of it from the Pentagon. Several Senate Republicans have already said they will side with Democrats to support a resolution to rescind it, forcing Trump to sign his first veto.\n\nThe president, in a Thursday morning tweet, threatened to veto the resolution should it pass.\n\n\"A big National Emergency vote today by The United States Senate on Border Security & the Wall,\" Trump said. \"I am prepared to veto, if necessary. The Southern Border is a National Security and Humanitarian Nightmare, but it can be easily fixed!\"\n\nA big National Emergency vote today by The United States Senate on Border Security & the Wall (which is already under major construction). I am prepared to veto, if necessary. The Southern Border is a National Security and Humanitarian Nightmare, but it can be easily fixed! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 14, 2019\n\nMore: Who are the Republican senators planning to vote against Trump's border emergency?\n\nWhite House officials, including Vice President Mike Pence, have scrambled behind the scenes to limit defections. A last-ditch effort by Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, to ease some GOP concerns about presidential emergencies collapsed Wednesday after the White House rejected it. Lee's proposal would have automatically terminated some presidential emergencies after 30 days, unless Congress voted to reauthorize them.\n\nHours before the vote \u2013 and after Republicans already walked away from the idea \u2013 Trump appeared to revisit it, indicating he would support some limit on future emergencies. But he offered no specifics.\n\n\"If, at a later date, Congress wants to update the law, I will support those efforts,\" Trump posted on Twitter, \"but today\u2019s issue is BORDER SECURITY and Crime!!!\"\n\nHere\u2019s a look at how to read Thursday\u2019s vote in the Senate in terms of how many Republicans buck Trump, and what the final count could mean for the president:\n\n0-3 defectors: Victory for Trump\n\nIf the White House flips even one of the Republicans who have announced their opposition, it would represent a significant achievement. It would also signal that congressional Republicans see their reelection as being tied to the border wall as much as Trump does.\n\nThe GOP lawmakers who have signaled their opposition to the emergency include Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Rand Paul of Kentucky and, as of Wednesday, Lee. Critics say they agree with Trump that the border needs more resources but they say Trump's emergency declaration steps on the nation's founding principle of the separation of powers.\n\n\"My concern is really about the institution of the Congress,\" Murkowski said recently. \"The power of the purse rests with the Congress.\"\n\nPresident Trump speaks during an inspection of border wall prototypes in San Diego March 13, 2018. (Photo: Mandel Ngan, AFP/Getty Images)\n\n4-7 defectors: Rebuke\n\nDemocrats need four Republican votes to rescind Trump\u2019s emergency \u2013 and barring last-minute changes, they appear to have those votes. Because the Democratic-led House has already approved the resolution, a Senate vote could send the measure to the president\u2019s desk.\n\nUnder the National Emergencies Act, Congress can rescind a presidential emergency with a simple majority. With Trump poised to veto the resolution, it's unlikely opponents of the emergency would be able to garner enough support to overturn a veto.\n\nRoughly a dozen Senate Republicans remain on the fence, adding to the drama. Some, such as Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, have pushed Trump to take another course. Lee had proposed a compromise to tighten the rules around future emergencies.\n\nBut the concept struggled to gain support from the White House or Republicans opposed to Trump's emergency.\n\nCollins told reporters that the Lee proposal did \"not address the current problem that we have, where the president, in my judgment, is usurping congressional authority.\"\n\nA White House spokesman did not respond to questions about the Lee proposal.\n\n\"It is inconsistent with the U.S. Constitution because, after the American Revolution against a king, our founders chose not to create a chief executive with the power to tax the people and spend their money any way he chooses,\" Alexander said recently.\n\nMore than 8 defectors: GOP revolt\n\nThe closer the tally of Republican defectors gets to double digits, the bigger problem Trump could have in explaining his expected veto.\n\nTrump insists he is using the emergency powers available to him under the law, and correctly notes that past presidents have signed dozens of emergency declarations. But critics say Trump\u2019s emergency declaration, by contrast, is a response to his inability to convince Congress of the need for billions in wall funding.\n\nAnd that is unusual. The emergency declaration is already the subject of several lawsuits.\n\nTrump declared the emergency after Congress included only $1.375 billion for the border wall in their most recent government funding measure. The amount was far short of the $5.7 billion Trump initially insisted on during the 35-day government shutdown that ended in January only after he relented.\n\nTrump's job approval remains high within the GOP, a factor that could limit defections. But while a majority of Republicans back the emergency declaration, some two-thirds of Americans overall opposed it, according to several polls earlier this year.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell did not answer when a reporter asked him Wednesday if passage of the resolution would represent a rebuke of the president.\n\n\u201cI think everybody in my conference is in favor of the president's position on the wall and on border security,\" the characteristically understated GOP leader said. \"It is no secret that the use of the national emergency law has generated a good deal of discussion.\"\n\nBorder wall risks: Trump's national emergency carries big risks, rewards\n\nWarning ignored: Senate leaders warned a wall emergency would divide GOP\n\nPolls: Donald Trump's base sticking with him despite after shutdown cave\n\nContributing: Deborah Berry\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/03/14/donald-trump-faces-gop-revolt-senate-border-wall-emergency-vote/3145512002/",

    "title": "Trump call for budget cuts sparks new shutdown fears",
    "description": "The White House's budget request will come some seven months before federal funding runs out again on Sept. 30.",
    "text": "Although the White House's budget request is merely a messaging document, President Donald Trump\u2019s posture will contribute to apprehension about a government shutdown. | Tom Brenner/Getty Images White House Trump to seek $8.6 billion to finish border wall before 2020 election The request, part of a budget offer that focuses on broad spending cuts, sparks new shutdown fears.\n\nPresident Donald Trump will ask Congress for another $8.6 billion to complete a 722-mile wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, a senior administration official told POLITICO on Sunday, part of a cost-cutting opening budget offer that will dismiss hopes for a grand budget deal and likely stoke fresh fears of another government shutdown.\n\nThe president will make the request on Monday in his broader proposal for the upcoming fiscal year, which ends just one month before the 2020 presidential election. The sum \u2014 billions of dollars higher than the $5.7 billion border-security demand that sparked the 35-day government shutdown \u2014 will surely divide spending negotiators again this year, likely resulting in static funding levels for much of the rest of the government or another lapse.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe administration already plans to use $8.1 billion in the current fiscal year to finish more than half of the wall by dipping into other funding sources, including through Trump\u2019s controversial emergency order that Congress is moving toward rebuking. The $8.6 billion request for fiscal 2020 would allow the administration to complete all 722 miles, according to the administration official, who spoke on background.\n\nReuters first reported the $8.6 billion request.\n\nIn his overall proposal, dubbed \u201cA Budget for a Better America: Promises Kept. Taxpayers First,\u201d Trump will put on paper what the White House has already prepared lawmakers to receive \u2014 an audacious plan for sucking 5 percent from the budgets of nonmilitary arms of the federal government, while using an accounting trick to bust beyond set spending limits for defense programs. The 5 percent would be below the fiscal 2019 budget limits for domestic agencies.\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget said Sunday that the budget would call for a total of $2.7 trillion in spending cuts, a higher proposed reduction than any other administration in history.\n\nThe budget office also said the request would seek funding for more Border Patrol agents, as well as Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel. The blueprint will call for holding colleges and universities \u201caccountable,\u201d by requiring them to share some of the financial burden of student loans. And Trump will request more than $80 billion, a 10 percent increase over fiscal 2019 levels, for veterans health care, according to the OMB.\n\nThe administration will also project robust economic growth above 3 percent, propose taking longer to balance the books than Republicans have advocated in the past and seek funding for a new Space Force within the Air Force.\n\nAlthough the request is merely a messaging document, the president\u2019s posture will contribute to apprehension about a government shutdown, some seven months before federal funding runs out again on Sept. 30.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, even Republicans are saying the president will need to come to the realization that the GOP must give some ground this year to Democrats, who hold the House majority and 47 seats in the Senate. But the Trump administration wants to hold fast to its mission to slash spending.\n\n\u201cCongress wants an automatic big-spending deal, and now they\u2019re upset because they lost their favorite talking point that the president\u2019s budget assumes a caps increase,\u201d a senior administration official speaking on background said Saturday, referring to an increase in budget limits set eight years ago. \u201cCongress hasn\u2019t grappled with their spending addiction since 2011, and the administration is forcing the conversation before the debt crisis worsens.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, Democrats in Congress have insisted that spending increases above the budget caps remain equal for defense and nondefense spending. But Trump administration officials say the president won\u2019t bend this time to those demands of funding \u201cparity.\u201d\n\nCongressional Republicans say that could produce another stalemate and shutdown.\n\n\u201cSorry, you\u2019re elected to deal, you\u2019ve got to deal,\u201d said Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.), who chairs the spending subcommittee that funds the departments of Education, Labor and Health and Human Services. \u201cThey\u2019re going to all have to compromise. \u2026 And the longer they delay, the more threatening it will be to the economy, the more likely we are to slide into some sort of confrontation that results in a government shutdown.\u201d\n\nBesides 5 percent cuts below fiscal 2019 caps for nondefense programs, Trump\u2019s budget request is expected to project economic growth of 3.2 percent this year, 3.1 percent in 2020, 3 percent in 2021 and 2.8 percent in 2026, with a 10-year forecast of 3 percent.\n\nThe plan will also seek to balance the budget within 15 years, by 2034, rather than bringing spending in line with revenue over the typical 10-year period that's been a goal for Republicans.\n\nThe budget request is expected to restart partisan feuding over border-security funding. If the president issues the same ultimatum this year \u2014 threatening to veto any spending plan that falls short of his request for billions of dollars \u2014 another shutdown could be in the offing, or Congress could be forced to approve static funding for much of the rest of the government.\n\nDemocratic congressional leaders warned of just such a scenario on Sunday.\n\n\u201cCongress refused to fund his wall and he was forced to admit defeat and reopen the government,\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement. \u201cThe same thing will repeat itself if he tries this again.\u201d\n\nThrough his budget request, Trump will also seek $100 million for the Women\u2019s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative his daughter and adviser, Ivanka, is spearheading with an aim to assist 50 million women in developing countries by 2025 through aid programs and partnerships with private businesses.\n\nThe president will ask Congress to fund a new Space Force within the Air Force, a project expected to cost $72 million in fiscal 2020 with a 200-person headquarters and eventually grow to about 900 people for a cost of about $500 million a year.\n\nIn the plan, the Trump administration will detail reforms to eliminate duplication and increase efficiency within federal agencies.\n\nWhen a president\u2019s annual budget request arrives on Capitol Hill, lawmakers love the retort: \u201cThe president proposes, Congress disposes.\u201d Spending leaders are already taking this year\u2019s plan less seriously, however, than past presidents\u2019 wish lists.\n\n\u201cThis one is frankly less realistic than most presidential budgets,\u201d said Cole, calling it a \u201cgimmick\u201d to avoid budget limits by trying to stash $174 billion of $750 billion in defense funding within the Overseas Contingency Operations fund that doesn\u2019t count toward the caps. \u201cThat\u2019s fine, but Congress isn\u2019t going to accept that.\u201d\n\nSenate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) said last week that it would be hard for Congress to find consensus to cut nondefense programs by 5 percent, as the president seeks. \u201cPlus, you\u2019ve got the House, too. You\u2019ve got a third leg of politics,\u201d Shelby said.\n\nCongress has less than seven months to pass spending bills to fund the government in fiscal 2020, which begins on Oct. 1. An overarching deal on limits for defense and nondefense funding is the first step in that process. From there, spending leaders can divvy up limits among the 12 annual spending bills, then among each federal department, agency and program.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to figure out a number,\u201d Shelby said. \u201cUltimately, when we put a bill together, we\u2019ve got to have some numbers we can agree to.\u201d\n\nWhite House budget director Russell Vought already signaled, in an op-ed last month, that the Trump administration might oppose any congressional deal to raise the budget caps, citing \u201cunsustainable\u201d levels of borrowing. And it would not be out of the question for Trump to ultimately veto such a deal, if congressional leaders tuned out his demands.\n\nHouse Budget Chairman John Yarmuth (D-Ky.) insists Democrats will at the very least seek to raise caps equally for nondefense programs and the military, while pursuing greater investment in things like education and health care.\n\n\u201cThere is bipartisan consensus on Capitol Hill that we must raise the caps for both non-defense and defense discretionary spending levels ... The Administration\u2019s plan to delay is a total disregard for responsible governing,\" Yarmuth said in a statement Saturday.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s renewed focus on fiscal responsibility comes after two years of ignoring a ballooning deficit and shepherding passage of a tax overhaul that contributed to a federal debt of more than $22 trillion. But in a release Sunday previewing the budget, Vought blamed the Obama administration for that debt level, saying Trump\u2019s latest budget request \u201cshows that we can return to fiscal sanity.\u201d",

Layoffs remain near the lowest level in decades.\n\nThe numbers: The number of people who applied for unemployment benefits in early March fell slightly, keeping so-called jobless claims near the lowest levels in a half-century.\n\nJobless claims, a rough measure of layoffs, fell by 3,000 to 223,000 in the seven days ended March 2, the government said Thursday.

The monthly average is viewed as more stable since it smoothens weekly gyrations.\n\nThe number of people already collecting unemployment benefits, known as continuing claims, declined by 50,000 to 1.76 million.\n\nWhat happened: The number of layoffs in the economy is still extremely low, but they no longer appear to be falling.\n\nNew claims had sunk to as low as 200,000 in early January and continuing claims bottomed out at a 46-year trough of 1.64 million last fall.\n\nBig picture: The U.S. economy slowed toward the end of 2018 and got off to a sluggish start in the new year, hurt by the partial government shutdown and a festering trade dispute with China.\n\nGrowth is likely to pick up in the spring, but probably not as rapidly as it did last year. The early effects of the Trump tax cuts have faded and a global economic slowdown is another headwind.\n\nThe government on Friday will unveil how many new jobs were created in February.

    "description": "Trump is calling for deep cuts in federal spending and billions more for his proposed border wall in a budget proposal unlikely to gain traction.",
    "text": "CLOSE The White House's top budget official is defending the Trump administration's record $4.7 trillion spending proposal which boosts funding for defense and President Trump's southern border wall while slashing some domestic programs. (March 11) AP\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump called for deep cuts in environmental and safety net programs, billions more for his border wall and a huge boost for the military in a $4.75 trillion 2020 budget proposal that is unlikely to gain traction in Congress.\n\nTrump delivered his first budget under a divided government Monday, a road map that would not balance the books for 15 years despite deep reductions. The proposal also called for $8.6 billion for Trump's border wall, a request Democrats flatly rejected.\n\n\"Congress has been ignoring the president's spending reductions for the last two years,\" Trump's top budget aide, Russell Vought, told reporters when pressed for an explanation about why the budget anticipates a $1.1 trillion deficit next year.\n\nEven before Democrats claimed control of the House, similar proposals by Trump failed in Congress. The schism between the president's wish list and actual government spending only deepened after a dispute over the border wall led to a 35-day partial government shutdown that ended in January.\n\n\"This is not a serious proposal,\" said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the top Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n\nPresidential budgets, required by the Budget and Accounting Act of 1921, for decades have had more to do with politics than policy. With the 2020 election underway, the document gives Trump an opportunity to lay out a vision he can trumpet to supporters.\n\nNot your budget: 'Get rid of the fat': Why Uncle Sam's budget is different from yours\n\nWhat Trump wants\n\nThe White House is eager to sell three messages with the president's third budget: that Trump hasn\u2019t given up on building his long-promised border wall, that he wants to increase military spending and that he hopes to slash just about everything else.\n\nThe president requested $8.6 billion more for his wall, just weeks after Congress failed to approve his demand for $5.7 billion. With both sides dug in on the issue, the latest proposal is certain to go nowhere. Trump declared a national emergency in February, a move the White House says will free up billions more for the wall.\n\nTrump is also requesting billions more in spending at the Defense Department \u2013 one of the few priorities that could gain some attention from lawmakers. After initially considering Pentagon cuts last year, the White House embraced a proposal to increase the Defense Department\u2019s budget 5 percent to $750 billion.\n\nOther proposals include:\n\n\u2022 A $2.8 billion, or 31 percent reduction in for the Environmental Protection Agency and a $327 billion cut to safety-net programs. Some of that reduction would be carried out by imposing a work requirement for food stamps, Medicaid and other programs.\n\n\u2022 A new user fee on e-cigarettes and other electronic nicotine delivery system products to \"address today\u2019s alarming rise in youth e-cigarette use.\"\n\n\u2022 Nearly $315 million to hire an additional 1,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and 128 immigration court prosecuting attorneys.\n\n\u2022 Almost $300 million toward the goal eliminating nearly all new infections of HIV/AIDS within 10 years.\n\nWhy it won't happen\n\nSome proposals in Trump's budget could become law, but most of the high-profile items will face tough odds.\n\nTrump has proposed many of the same changes before, without success. Last year\u2019s budget, which came at a time when Republicans controlled both the House and Senate, included $18 billion for the border wall. His 2017 budget proposed eliminating 62 federal agencies entirely. Congress largely ignored those requests and many others.\n\nNone of those agencies was eliminated and lawmakers approved only $1.37 billion for border barriers. That partly reflects a politically divided Congress but also the fact that the president's budget has long been viewed as a wish list.\n\nGovernment printers published about 20,000 hard copies of the president's budget, and a spokesman for the Government Publishing Office says the online version of the document averages about 2 million retrievals each year.\n\nThe budget proposal must include information about how much the government collected in taxes and other revenue, the public debt and proposed spending priorities. But the real work of spending taxpayer money is handled by the congressional appropriations process. And that means Democrats and Republicans must work together to decide which programs should be prioritized.\n\nEven some Republicans remained noncommittal about the White House proposal.\n\n\u201cI look forward to reviewing additional details,\" said Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, \"Throughout the next few months, the (committee) will conduct hearings and carefully review the president\u2019s proposal.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump signs a Bible as he greets people at Providence Baptist Church in Smiths Station, Ala., Friday, March 8, 2019, during a tour of areas where tornados killed 23 people in Lee County, Ala.

    "text": "Getty Images The U.S. trade deficit sank 15% in January after soaring at the end of 2018. Sharp swings in the trade gap largely reflect a disruption in trade with China due to U.S. tariffs and retaliatory measures.\n\nThe numbers: The trade deficit shrank 15% in January after soaring in December, a dramatic swing that reflects how much the tense standoff between the U.S. and China has disrupted the flow of goods and weighed on the economies of both countries.\n\nThe deficit shrank to $51.1 billion in January from almost $60 billion in December, the government said Wednesday, largely because of cheaper oil, surging soybean exports and lower Chinese imports.\n\nEconomists polled by MarketWatch had forecast a $57.7 billion deficit.\n\nThe lower U.S. trade deficit, if it persists, could provide a small boost in the first quarter to gross domestic product, the official scorecard of the economy. But the drop in imports could also be taken as sign of softening demand in the U.S. that adds to worries about a slower growth.\n\nWhatever the case, the U.S. is coming off the highest annual deficit in a decade and it\u2019s unlikely the gap will shrink much if at all in 2019.\n\nWhat happened: Imports rose for the first time in four months, but barely so. They edged up 0.9% to $207.3 billion, the Commerce Department said Wednesday.\n\nSoybean exports soared to $1.21 billion in January from less than $300 million in December. They were also up almost 50% compared to the same month a year earlier.\n\nExports of the key Midwestern crop have been subjected to large swings because of their central role in the ongoing trade U.S.-China standoff. China is a huge market for American soybeans, but until recently it blocked some sales in retaliation against U.S. tariffs.\n\nExports of U.S. autos and parts also rose.\n\nImports slipped 2.6% to $258.5 billion in January, marking the second decline in a row.\n\nThe cost of imported oil fell to the lowest level in three years, reducing America\u2019s foreign energy bill. The U.S. also imported fewer computers and semiconductors.\n\nThe rift between the U.S. and China, meanwhile, continues to disrupt the enormous flow of trade between the two countries.\n\nU.S. exports to China and Hong Kong, for example, tumbled in January to a nine-year low, just a month after a big surge that pushed the annual gap with the Asian giant to an all-time high.\n\nThe nation\u2019s deficit in goods with China soared in December as American firms sought to bring in more imports ahead of a threatened increase in U.S. tariffs that was eventually postponed.\n\nThe U.S. and China have been locked in intense talks to resolve the dispute, but so far an agreement remains out of reach.\n\nThe January trade report delayed by the partial federal shutdown early in the year.\n\nRead: Why the markets aren\u2019t buying the Fed\u2019s claims about the strength of the U.S. economy\n\nBig picture: The trade dispute between the two biggest economies in the world has cast a pall over the global economy.\n\nEven a deal President Trump finds favorable, however, would be unlikely to substantially shrink huge trade deficits, at least not in the short run.\n\nThe U.S. has a stronger economy than most of its trading partners, whetting the appetite of Americans for foreign goods, many of which are no longer produced at home. A strong dollar also makes imports cheaper for Americans and U.S. goods more expensive for foreigners.\n\nRead: The Fed is gun-shy because of a quarter-century of low inflation\n\nWhat they are saying?: \u201cThe sharp fall in the trade deficit in January was mainly due to a larger than expected drop in imports, which is hardly a positive sign for the economy,\u201d said Michael Pearce, senior U.S. economist at Capital Economics.\n\nMarket reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.15% and S&P 500 SPX, +0.21% fell in Wednesday trades.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, +1.95% continued its steady descent, touching 2.37%.

    "text": "Getty Images The construction business appears to have rebounded in early 2019 after a spell of weakness toward the end of last year.\n\nThe numbers: Builders boosted construction in February for the third month in row, reflecting a surprising oasis of strength amid a sea of recently disappointing reports on the U.S. economy.\n\nConstruction spending rose 1% in February following an even larger 2.5% gain in January, the Census Bureau said Monday. The figures are seasonally adjusted.\n\nEconomists polled by MarketWatch had expected a small decline.\n\nWhat happened: The increase in construction spending in January was revised up from a preliminary 1.3%.\n\nAfter taking the revision into account, the pace of construction in the first two months of 2019 was the strongest since last summer. States and localities pitched in with more spending on roads and bridges.\n\nEconomists said the rebound could possibly reflect a payback of sorts after unusually soft spending late last year. The 35-day partial government shutdown and the usual disruptions caused by winter weather may have also contributed to recent ups and downs in the government\u2019s monthly report on construction spending.\n\nWhatever the case, the construction industry is still not expanding as rapidly as it was a few years ago. The annual rate of spending topped 10% in 2014 and 2015, but investment has only risen 1.1% in the past 12 months.\n\nBig picture: Home builders and commercial construction companies turned cautious last year as interest rates surged and the Trump White House fought a pitched battle over free trade with many key trading partners.\n\nInterest rates have tumbled in 2019, however, and the U.S. and China might be close to a deal to ratchet down trade tensions. That could give a small boost to construction in 2019, though the industry is not expecting a major turnaround.\n\nThe most immediate impact: First-quarter gross domestic product could be a touch better than what Wall Street had been forecasting. Economists polled by MarketWatch predict GDP will expand 1.5% in the first three months of the year.\n\nMarket reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.15% and S&P 500 SPX, +0.21% rose sharply in Monday trades after fresh data showed stronger growth in the Chinese economy, the second largest in the world.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, +1.95% was little changed at 2.44%.\n\nMortgages, auto loans and other common forms of borrowing are tied to changes in the 10-year note.

    "title": "Trump To Ask Congress For Additional $8.6 Billion For Border Wall In New Budget",
    "description": "The demand is six times what Congress allocated for border projects in each of the past two fiscal years.",
    "text": "WASHINGTON, March 10 (Reuters) \u2015 President Donald Trump on Monday will ask the U.S. Congress for an additional $8.6 billion to help pay for the wall he promised to build on the southern border with Mexico to combat illegal immigration and drug trafficking, officials familiar with his 2020 budget request told Reuters.\n\nThe demand is more than six times what Congress allocated for border projects in each of the past two fiscal years, and 6 percent more than Trump has corralled by invoking emergency powers this year.\n\nDemocrats, who oppose the wall as unnecessary and immoral, control the U.S. House of Representatives, making it unlikely the Republican president\u2019s request will win congressional passage. Republicans control the Senate.\n\nThe proposal comes on the heels of a bruising battle with Congress over wall funding that resulted in a five-week partial federal government shutdown that ended in January, and could touch off a sequel just ahead of a trifecta of ominous fiscal deadlines looming this fall.\n\nRegardless of whether Congress passes it, the budget request could help Trump frame his argument on border security as the 2020 presidential race begins to take shape, with the president seeking re-election.\n\n\u201cBuild the wall\u201d was one of his signature campaign pledges in his first run for office in 2016. \u201cFinish the wall\u201d is already a feature of his re-election campaign, a rallying cry plastered across banners and signs at his campaign rallies.\n\n\u201cIt gives the president the ability to say he has fulfilled his commitment to gain operational control of the southwest border,\u201d an administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said of the budget request.\n\n\u201cWe have provided the course of action, the strategy and the request to finish the job. It\u2019s a question of, will Congress allow us to finish the job,\u201d a second administration official said.\n\nFunding legislation needs to be passed before Oct. 1 - the start of the 2020 federal fiscal year - or the government could shut down again. If Congress and the White House fail to agree to lift mandatory spending caps set in a 2011 law, steep automatic cuts in many programs would kick in. Around the same time, Trump and lawmakers must agree to lift the debt ceiling, or risk a default, which would have chaotic economic fallout.\n\n722 Miles Of Wall\n\nTrump\u2019s wall request is based off a 2017 plan put forward by Customs and Border Protection officials to build or replace 722 miles (1,162 km) of barrier along the border, which in total is estimated to cost about $18 billion.\n\nSo far, only 111 miles (179 km) have been built or are underway, officials said. In fiscal 2017, $341 million in funding was allocated for 40 miles (64 km) of wall, and in 2018, another $1.375 billion was directed to 82 miles (132 km).\n\nFor fiscal 2019, Trump demanded $5.7 billion in wall funds, but Congress appropriated only $1.375 billion for border fencing projects.\n\nFollowing the rejection of his wall funding demand, Trump declared the border was a national emergency - a move opposed by Democrats and some Republicans - and redirected $601 million in Treasury Department forfeiture funds, $2.5 billion in Defense Department drug interdiction funds and $3.6 billion from a military construction budget, for total spending of $8.1 billion for the wall.\n\nThe administration has not estimated how far the 2019 funds will go, but officials said average costs are about $25 million per mile (1.6 km).\n\nTrump\u2019s $8.6 billion in proposed wall funding for fiscal 2020 would include $5 billion from the Department of Homeland Security budget and $3.6 billion from the Pentagon\u2019s military construction budget. The budget proposal will also include another $3.6 million in military construction funding to make up for any projects delayed by the wall, officials said.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security is one of a few priority areas to get a boost in Trump\u2019s budget plan, which seeks to slash funding to many non-defense programs.\n\nTrump will propose an overall 5 percent increase to the Department of Homeland Security budget over fiscal 2019 appropriations, including $3.3 billion, or 22 percent more, for Customs and Border Protection, and $1.2 billion more for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a 16 percent hike, officials said.\n\nThe budget proposal includes a plan to hire more than 2,800 law enforcement and support personnel for the agencies, and 100 immigration judge teams, officials said.\n\nTrump faces both political and court battles to free up the money he wants for the current fiscal year. Many lawmakers accused Trump of overstepping his constitutional powers by declaring an emergency to free up the funds. The House has already voted to revoke the emergency, and the Senate is likely to do the same this week. Trump is expected to veto the resolution.\n\nA coalition of state governments led by California has sued Trump to block the emergency move, though legal experts have said the lawsuits face a difficult road.",

    "title": "Exclusive: Senate Democrats have a new plan to pay federal contractors who lost money during the shutdown",
    "description": "They want it included in a disaster relief bill that Congress is working on right now.",
    "text": "More than 30 Democratic senators, led by Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-MD), want Congress to include back pay for contractors who were affected by the partial government shutdown in an upcoming disaster relief package.\n\nThe 800,000 federal government employees who were caught up in the shutdown in December and January got back pay after the 35-day impasse but as many as 580,000 contractors did not. Many of them still have yet to receive any funds to make up for the gaping hole left by their January paychecks.\n\nBecause they work for third-party companies that the government pays for their services, contractors don\u2019t get paid when these services aren\u2019t used. During past shutdowns, contractors have been forced to simply chalk up this lack of pay as a loss.\n\nDemocratic senators, along with Republican Sen. Susan Collins (ME), have signed on to the letter that pushes appropriations leaders to address this gap.\n\n\u201cThe people who were severely harmed by this are still struggling,\u201d Van Hollen told Vox. \u201cYou have these employees who went without a paycheck for 35 days. They are still facing extreme financial hardship.\u201d\n\nIn a Friday letter to Senate Appropriations Chair Richard Shelby (R-AL) and ranking member Patrick Leahy (D-VT), the senators urge them to consider attaching contractor back pay to supplemental funding measures for the 2019 fiscal year or other spending bills in the works. One of these measures is a disaster relief bill that lawmakers are currently weighing on the Hill. If contractor back pay ends up included as part of this package, it would mark the first time Congress has ever approved it after a shutdown.\n\nBut Democratic lawmakers face a tough battle: Both the White House and some Senate Republicans have said they oppose contractor back pay.\n\nContractor back pay was blocked by the White House earlier this year due to cost concerns. Senators think they have an answer.\n\nDuring the debate over an omnibus spending package lawmakers passed earlier this year, federal contractor back pay was discussed but not ultimately included. That was largely due to pushback about its cost from the White House and some Senate Republicans.\n\nAn informal score from the Congressional Budget Office, which evaluates the costs associated with different pieces of legislation, estimated the costs at $1 billion.\n\nBut Democrats argue that the cost is actually lower than that because some contractor pay was previously built into federal agency budgets, Van Hollen says.\n\nAgencies have already budgeted a set amount for contractors, which include janitors, cafeteria workers, developers, and consultants. So the actual back pay for workers would not be an additional cost. Democrats say they\u2019re simply calling on agencies to pay out money in their budgets they would have spent anyway if the shutdown hadn\u2019t happened.\n\n\u201cIf you budget to pay security contractors and janitorial services ... those payments are still included in the budget [even if your agency closed down],\u201d Van Hollen says. Plus, agencies already have mechanisms to pay contractors, meaning the administrative costs could also likely be kept to a minimum, he notes.\n\nThe push to add contractor back pay to disaster relief funding is also notable because both would be one-time funding expenditures. Disaster relief funding does not interfere with agency spending caps, and contractor back pay could be treated the same way, Van Hollen says.\n\nSome Senate Republicans have told Vox they feel that contractors are private employees, and shouldn\u2019t necessarily receive back pay if they didn\u2019t work during the shutdown, unlike furloughed federal employees.\n\nVan Hollen and other Democrats vigorously disagree.\n\n\u201cThese are individuals doing work on behalf of the federal government,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is simply not fair to put the entire financial burden of something they couldn\u2019t control on them.\u201d",

    "description": "After a torrent of bad news, the economy appears to have sunk into a malaise. Or has it?",
    "text": "Getty Images The U.S. economy has been hit by an avalanche of bad news in early 2019, such as a dismal 20,000 increase in new jobs in February. It\u2019s going to take a few months for the economy to dig itself out.\n\nAfter a torrent of bad news, the economy appears to have sunk into a malaise. Or has it?\n\nFirst came the biggest plunge in retail sales in nine years. Then home construction slumped. And now hiring seems to have hit the skids.\n\nThe U.S. added a dismal 20,000 new jobs in February, the smallest increase in 17 months and one of the worst performances during the nearly 10-year-old economic expansion. The meager increase fell well short of Wall Street\u2019s forecast and triggered the fifth straight decline in U.S. stocks DJIA, +0.15% SPX, +0.21%\n\nRead: U.S. adds just 20,000 jobs in February\n\nTaken individually, each of these reports appears to exaggerate the weakness in the economy. The February employment report was especially odd after a huge 311,000 increase in hiring in January. Economists say bad weather and the lingering effects of the government shutdown likely skewed the report.\n\n\u201cThe deeper you get into the details, the more likely it seems to be that the headline miss was a one-off and not the start of a new worrisome trend,\u201d said senior economist Andrew Grantham of CIBC World Markets.\n\nBut taken together, these reports clearly show that growth in the U.S. has tapered off since the start of the new year in tandem with the broader global economy.\n\n\u201cWe can now add the U.S. labor market to the chorus of global economic indicators pointing to a sharp slowdown in economic activity in the first quarter,\u201d said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West.\n\nJust how much the U.S. slowed is still unclear.\n\nMany economists think the 35-day federal shutdown in late December and January may have thrown a wrench in the ability of government economists to measure the economy. They suspect some of the weak reports are likely to be revised higher.\n\nThe first big test comes Monday. The government is likely to report that retail sales fell again in January for the second month in a row owing to cheaper gas prices and weaker auto sales.\n\nWhat Wall Street really wants to know is whether the initially reported 1.2% plunge in sales in December stands after the government updates its numbers.\n\nTraditional brick-and-mortar stores such as Macy\u2019s M, -0.24% and Kohl\u2019s KSS, +0.20% posted disappointing sales, but Amazon AMZN, +0.37% and other online retailers said the holiday season was a strong one. Credit-card issuers Visa V, +0.43% and Mastercard MA, -0.14% also say holiday sales were robust.\n\nRead: Trade deficit soars to 10-year high, foiling Trump White House efforts to rein it in\n\nAlso Read: Don\u2019t blame oil for surging trade deficit - it\u2019s all the other stuff Americans buy\n\nFurther out, Wall Street is also convinced the February employment report will turn out to be an aberration.\n\n\u201cWe expect to see a bounceback in payroll job growth in March,\u201d said Robert Dye, chief economist of Comerica.\n\nWhile investors strive to figure out what\u2019s really going on, one thing they won\u2019t have to worry about is inflation \u2014 even after the biggest increase in wages in 10 years.\n\nThe cost of wholesale and consumer goods might have risen in February, the government could report next week, but inflation more broadly is low and stable after a sharp decline in the second half of 2018.\n\nThe consumer price index rose at 1.6% pace in the 12 months ended in January.\n\nSteady hiring, rising wages and low inflation \u2014 those aren\u2019t the hallmarks of an economy ready to crumble.\n\n\u201cGiven jobs and wages are the current keystone of the economy, and that inflation is not an issue or even on the horizon, the expansion looks healthy for this year and next, all things being equal,\u201d contended Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union.",

    "description": "Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) condemned Trump's efforts to bypass Congress for money to build a U.S.-Mexico border wall.",
    "text": "Rep. Justin Amash (R-Mich.) on Sunday bashed President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to unilaterally declare a national emergency to secure funding for his long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\u201cWe have a system of separation of powers under our Constitution,\u201d Amash, a member of the House oversight committee, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState Of The Union.\u201d\n\nHe added that Trump could have vetoed past spending bills if he truly felt there was a border security crisis that lawmakers needed to address.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s never vetoed appropriations legislation and now he wants to declare an emergency to do something Congress has already debated and discussed,\u201d Amash said.\n\nThe president regularly warns of an \u201cinvasion\u201d of immigrants entering the U.S. from its southern border, despite studies showing illegal border crossings have significantly dropped over the last decade.\n\nRep. @JustinAmash, one of 13 Republicans to oppose Trump\u2019s emergency declaration: \u201cThe President doesn\u2019t get to decide that he can override Congress simply because Congress doesn\u2019t do what he wants \u2026 If there were an emergency...there would be a lot more consensus\u201d #CNNSOTU pic.twitter.com/X1Vb3702OQ \u2014 State of the Union (@CNNSotu) March 3, 2019\n\nTrump allowed a partial government shutdown to start in late December after Democrats refused to allocate $5 billion toward his border wall in a federal spending bill. The budget impasse continued for 35 days \u2015 the longest such closure in U.S. history \u2015 until the president agreed to reopen the government for three weeks while Congress negotiated border security funding.\n\nOn Feb. 15, Trump signed Congress\u2019 spending bill that allocated $1.375 billion for 55 miles of \u201cpedestrian fencing\u201d \u2015 a fraction of his initial demand. He also declared a national emergency to reroute about $3.6 billion from Defense Department construction projects and another $2.5 billion the department had allocated for counter-drug activities to build the wall.\n\nAmash was one of 13 Republicans in the Democratic-controlled House last week to vote in favor of a resolution to block Trump\u2019s emergency declaration. The Republican-controlled Senate is to vote on the resolution next week.\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) on Sunday became the fourth Republican senator to announce his intentions to vote in favor of the resolution, increasing the likelihood that the measure will clear Congress and be sent to Trump\u2019s desk. That would force a presidential veto, the first of Trump\u2019s presidency.\n\nAmash on Sunday said it\u2019s possible a \u201cnational security crisis\u201d exists on the southern border, but said the president shouldn\u2019t simply bypass Congress to address it.\n\n\u201cThe president doesn\u2019t get to decide that he can override Congress simply because Congress doesn\u2019t do what he wants,\u201d Amash said. \u201cIf there were an emergency in the sense that the president is describing, there would be a lot more consensus.\u201d\n\nAsked whether Republicans who support Trump\u2019s national emergency are \u201cabdicating their responsibilities to the Constitution,\u201d Amash said yes.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that they are all intending to do that,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper. \u201cBut I think the president is violating our constitutional system. And I don\u2019t think Congress can grant legislative powers to the president by statute.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cThe best check on the president\u2019s action is Congress. It\u2019s not the courts. Our system is not designed so that the courts are going to resolve these disputes all the time between the legislative branch and the executive branch. We have to protect our own power. And that\u2019s what I\u2019m doing. And I\u2019m hopeful many Republican senators will agree.\u201d\n\nAmash, who did not endorse Trump during the 2016 election, also said he\u2019s not ruling out a third-party bid for president in 2020.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d never rule anything out,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not on my radar right now. But I think it is important that we have someone in [the White House] who\u2019s presenting a vision for America that is different from what these two parties are presenting. Right now, we have a wild amount of partisan rhetoric on both sides.\u201d",

    "title": "The Strange Story of the Most-Shared Story on Facebook in 2019",
    "description": "How a 119-word local crime brief went mega-viral.",
    "text": "Photo illustration by Slate. Photos by Thinkstock and Facebook.\n\nOn an otherwise ordinary Sunday in late January, a 32-year-old web editor for a chain of local radio stations in Central Texas ran across a news item that he found interesting. Ten minutes later, he had written and published what would become Facebook\u2019s most-shared story of 2019 so far.\n\nThe story has nothing to do with Donald Trump, celebrities, teens in MAGA hats, or the Democratic primary candidates. It\u2019s a 119-word local crime brief about a wanted suspect, and the man who wrote it never intended for it to reach a national audience, let alone amass more than 800,000 Facebook shares in the six weeks following its publication\u2014nearly twice as many as any other piece of English-language content this year.\n\nExactly how this news stub went mega-viral is a mystery no one has quite solved, though there are clues, starting with its alarming yet geographically ambiguous headline: \u201cSuspected Human Trafficker, Child Predator May Be in Our Area.\u201d At a time when fortunes can be built and lost on Facebook traffic, the story\u2019s wild success might seem like a bizarre accident, a glitch in the system. But it also suggests that, for all of Facebook\u2019s efforts to improve its news feed over the years, the social network remains as capricious and opaque an information source as ever.\n\nAaron Savage has worked at the same group of radio stations, based in Temple, Texas, for his whole professional life. He started in 2005 as a part-time board operator working Houston Astros games for KTEM NewsRadio 14 and worked his way up to digital managing editor for the five Killeen/Temple-area stations owned by Townsquare Media, a national chain. His job includes writing and publishing several news posts a day on the stations\u2019 websites and social media pages, which he administers by himself most days.\n\nFor all of Facebook\u2019s efforts to improve its news feed over the years, the social network remains as capricious and opaque an information source as ever.\n\nOn Jan. 27, Savage noticed a crime brief on the website of KWTX News 10, a local TV station with which KTEM NewsRadio has a partnership. The story, \u201cTexas Rangers Search Here for Human Trafficking Suspect,\u201d jumped out to him as \u201csomething that needs to be presented to the public any way we can,\u201d he told me in a phone interview. It gave the name and description of one Issac-John Bernard Collins, who was wanted for aggravated kidnapping, human trafficking, and sexual abuse of a young child. His case had not made headlines, but the allegations were disturbing, and authorities had reason to believe he was holed up in the Waco area.\n\nSavage did a quick rewrite, cited and linked to the original post, gave it a headline that he felt conveyed the appropriate urgency, and published it on the local radio websites he manages. An hour and a half later, he posted a link to the story from the Facebook page of one of those stations, US 105 FM New Country, based in Temple.\n\nAnd then, he says: \u201cIt just took off.\u201d Savage, who monitors traffic data on his stories via the Facebook-owned analytics tool CrowdTangle, says the numbers for the story \u201cwent through the roof\u201d overnight, quickly becoming US 105 FM\u2019s most-shared post ever. Savage didn\u2019t know until I told him in a phone interview last week that the story was named in a recent study by the analytics firm NewsWhip as the most-shared web content of 2019 so far.\n\nScreenshot via Facebook\n\nIt beat out, among other extremely viral stories, TMZ\u2019s report of Luke Perry\u2019s death, CNBC\u2019s breaking story about the end of the U.S. government shutdown, and an aggressively SEO-optimized Daily Mirror story about the viral \u201cMomo challenge.\u201d The original news brief that Savage\u2019s post was based on, by KWTX 10\u2019s weekend anchor Ke\u2019Sha Lopez, was nowhere on the list.\n\nHow did this happen? Neither a researcher for NewsWhip nor a spokesperson for Facebook and CrowdTangle could fully explain it. Nor could Savage himself, who called it \u201ca little scary\u201d that the post did so well. But each offered some intriguing hypotheses.\n\nOne of the critiques of Facebook as a news source has long been that its algorithm tends to circulate stories with provocative headlines, regardless of whether the content is reliable. That\u2019s a big reason why misleading partisan propaganda and even outright fabricated news stories thrived on the platform in the run-up to the 2016 elections, even as hard news from traditional media sources withered. It\u2019s why entire publications and media groups have sprung up over the years to make money gaming Facebook\u2019s algorithm: ViralNova, Elite Daily, Distractify, the Independent Journal Review.\n\nFacebook has responded with countless tweaks over the years designed to promote \u201chigh-quality content,\u201d discourage clickbait and like-bait, fact-check bogus stories, and punish pages that peddle misinformation. In 2018, Facebook announced a set of major algorithm changes designed to prioritize news from \u201ctrusted\u201d and \u201clocal\u201d sources, and to boost content shared by users\u2019 friends and family over content published by professional Facebook pages. It said users would see less news in their feeds overall, but what they did see would be more reliable, and that it would focus on facilitating \u201cmeaningful interactions\u201d among users.\n\nIn practice, the levers that Facebook\u2019s engineers pull tend to be blunter instruments than you might think. Facebook\u2019s mechanism for determining \u201ctrusted sources,\u201d for instance, turned out to be a two-question survey. It assumes news is \u201clocal\u201d to you if it\u2019s being shared by a publication that has an audience tightly clustered in your area\u2014regardless of whether the story\u2019s topic is actually local. It defines \u201cmeaningful interactions\u201d partly based on the number of comments on a post. NewsWhip\u2019s study shows that the outlets that receive the highest share of comments tend toward the tabloid-y side of the media spectrum: LifeZette, the Sun, the New York Post, and our old friend LADbible.com.\n\nAccording to CrowdTangle data provided by Facebook, Savage\u2019s story on the suspected child predator racked up more than 50,000 shares on the original US 105 FM post alone\u2014even though the station\u2019s Facebook page has only about 7,000 followers. Within days, the story was being shared by much larger pages, including the Longview Police Department, Donald Trump Republic 2016, and Good Times With Trump 2016-2024. Over the course of February, it found traction on an ever-wider variety of subnetworks, including the page of R&B singer Sarahi Allende and a group called Truckers Wall of Shame.\n\nIn each case, the story garnered not only traditional \u201cshares,\u201d in which people repost it to their own friends and family, but large numbers of comments in which users tagged other people they know, presumably to alert them to the danger. That pattern might help to explain why several stories about crime, including Amber Alerts, make NewsWhip\u2019s Top 10 most-shared list. (NewsWhip published a separate ranking of \u201cMost Engaged\u201d stories, a metric that counts other interactions such as likes and comments in addition to shares. The US 105 FM post ranked 15th on that list, with TMZ\u2019s Luke Perry story taking the top spot. You can download NewsWhip\u2019s full study here.)\n\nWhile Facebook couldn\u2019t confirm exactly what aspects of its algorithm helped the story on its way, Savage\u2019s crime brief appears to have ticked nearly every box that the social network is trying to prioritize. First, it was shared by a local news organization, making it more likely that people in the Waco area would see it at the top of their feeds. Second, it generated large numbers of comments, which Facebook counts as \u201cmeaningful interactions.\u201d Finally, its sharing was driven heavily by individual Facebook users, rather than by professional publishers with large followings, which means that it would be helped along by the company\u2019s focus on surfacing posts from \u201cfriends and family first.\u201d\n\nBut the wild card may have been the story\u2019s headline. While it was clear from reading the story that it was about Waco and Central Texas, the headline just said the predator was in \u201cour area.\u201d Anyone who read the headline without reading the story might reasonably have thought the story was about their area, even if they were far from Texas. When I mentioned that possibility to Savage, he agreed, and said he\u2019s usually more careful to localize his stories in the headline as well as the text.\n\nThat hypothesis was supported when I called the crime hotline listed in the story, which is run by the Texas State Department of Public Safety. The dispatcher, who declined to give his name, initially told me he couldn\u2019t provide information about any individual case. But when I mentioned some of the details, they quickly rang a bell: \u201cIs that the guy from the Facebook article?\u201d the dispatcher asked me. That guy, it turned out, he could give details on. \u201cHe was taken into custody over a month ago\u2014a few days after that article was posted.\u201d (The Texas DPS\u2019s communications department did not respond to multiple calls and emails seeking further information about the case.)\n\nThe apprehension was not made on the basis of a tip from anyone who read the story, he added. But that didn\u2019t stop people from trying. The tip line \u201clit up like a Christmas tree, sir,\u201d he told me. \u201cI received three calls a day for over three weeks from coast to coast.\u201d This despite the fact that Collins was apparently already in custody for much of the story\u2019s long-tail shelf life\u2014which rendered the article itself fundamentally misleading. It became, albeit unintentionally, a form of viral misinformation, which is exactly the sort of content that Facebook has been trying to avoid amplifying.\n\nWhile no sources I talked to suggested this, it\u2019s worth considering that there may also have been a darker factor at work in the story\u2019s virality. The scary headline about a wanted child predator along Texas\u2019 I-35 corridor came packaged with a picture of a suspect who appeared to be nonwhite, at a time when President Donald Trump\u2019s vilification of immigrants and push for a border wall was dominating national headlines. Some of the hundreds of thousands who shared it probably feared for their personal safety or that of their children. But it\u2019s also likely that many, including the popular Trump pages that helped it go viral, shared it because it appeared to reinforce a racist political narrative.\n\nIf you took all of Facebook\u2019s public statements at face value, you\u2019d expect today\u2019s news feeds to be dominated by friends, family, and various communities sharing high-quality, original, meaningful content. In practice, the company\u2019s algorithm changes tend to be more effective at curtailing existing strategies for gaming the system than advancing any particular high-minded social goals. If nothing else, the strange saga of the Collins crime brief is a reminder that the interactions between Facebook\u2019s users and its algorithm are murky and complex, and often produce results that reflect no one\u2019s idea of a healthy news diet.\n\nFor all the handwringing around Facebook stepping back from the news in 2018, NewsWhip\u2019s analysis found that engagement levels for web content on Facebook so far in 2019 have bounced back to 2017 levels. In other words, the quirks of Facebook\u2019s algorithm matter as much as ever in determining what people read, and which news sources thrive.\n\nWhen I asked Savage what he took away from his brush with virality, he thought for a moment, then said: \u201cI guess it\u2019s Mr. Zuckerberg\u2019s world, and we\u2019re just living in it.\u201d",

    "description": "- Slowing global growth and the 35-day partial federal government shutdown weighed on the U.S. economy in the first weeks of 2019, but it continued growing amid still tight labor markets, the Federal Reserve reported on Wednesday.",
    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Slowing global growth and the 35-day partial federal government shutdown weighed on the U.S. economy in the first weeks of 2019, but it continued growing amid still-tight labor markets, the Federal Reserve reported on Wednesday.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A closing sign is seen outside the National Gallery of Art in Washington, U.S., before it will be reopen after partial government shutdown, January 27, 2019. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas\n\n\u201cEconomic activity continued to expand in late January and February,\u201d even as concerns took root at the U.S. central bank about a possible slowdown, the Fed said in its regular \u201cBeige Book\u201d compendium of anecdotes compiled from industry and business contacts around the country.\n\nThe pace of growth was \u201cslight-to-moderate\u201d in 10 of the Fed\u2019s 12 districts, with those in Philadelphia and St. Louis reporting \u201cflat economic conditions.\u201d\n\nStill, the overall tenor of the Beige Book may relieve some of the concerns about growth in the real economy that prompted the Fed to pause its cycle of interest rate hikes in January after a sharp correction in financial markets and other risks began increasing late last year.\n\nTighter credit conditions were cited as damping consumer spending; concerns about tariffs continued to weigh on the minds of executives and crimp profits as input costs rose more than could be passed along to consumers; and the government shutdown \u201cled to slower economic activity in some sectors\u201d including manufacturing, retail and real estate, across roughly half of the Fed\u2019s districts.\n\nJob and wage gains, however, continued, with the St. Louis district reporting that opportunities for work were so plentiful that college enrollment was dropping \u201cas potential students were increasingly choosing to enter the labor market.\u201d\n\nIn the Philadelphia district, business contacts \u201ccontinued to note that the labor market was very tight ... Firms are responding by raising wages, increasing job flexibility, training new hires who have fewer skills than desired, and making greater use of trial periods of temp agency placements.\u201d\n\nThe Fed\u2019s policy-setting committee is scheduled to meet in two weeks to make its latest interest rate decision, and is widely expected to leave borrowing costs unchanged, consistent with the \u201cpatient\u201d strategy it outlined in January.\n\nPRICE PRESSURES\n\nInflation will be a key element of any decision about when or if to raise rates again, and the Beige Book reported that prices increased at only a \u201cmodest-to-moderate pace\u201d in the period.\n\nBut it also hinted at price pressures building in parts of the economy. The Fed\u2019s Cleveland district, for example, outlined an economy where price hikes were being passed among firms, with some feeling they were able to pass them along to consumers, and others not.\n\n\u201cConstruction companies passed on strong input cost increases. By contrast, manufacturers\u2019 prices remained more stable ... Transportation companies raised prices, but retailers did not raise prices to cover transportation cost increases,\u201d the Fed reported.\n\nAlthough much about the U.S. economic outlook remained positive, businesses cited continued concern about trade and tariffs and the health of the global economy in general.\n\nManufacturers in particular \u201cconveyed concerns about weakening global demand, higher costs due to tariffs, and ongoing trade policy uncertainty.\u201d In some areas, including the Philadelphia district, that caused regional growth to grind to a halt.\n\nThe economy in that area was reported slowing from \u201cmodest growth in the prior period to little or no change in the current period,\u201d the Fed said.\n\nWhile the impact of the government shutdown is expected to be small on a nationwide basis, it was noticeable in some parts of the country.\n\nThe Richmond Fed, whose area includes Washington, said \u201ca sharp decline in tourism was reported by several firms in and around the District of Columbia.\u201d",

    "text": "Lyft Inc was valued at $24.3 billion in the first initial public offering (IPO) of a ride-hailing startup on Thursday, raising more than it had set off to do as investors overlooked uncertainty over its path to becoming a profitable company.\n\nLyft\u2019s IPO sets the stage for the stock market debut of larger rival Uber Technologies Inc, which Reuters has reported will kick off in April. Uber has been told by its investment bankers that it could be valued at as much as $120 billion.\n\nThe success of the IPO came despite Lyft\u2019s steep loses, criticism of its dual-class share structure and some concerns over its strategy for autonomous driving, for fear of missing out on the company\u2019s strong revenue growth.\n\n\u201cIn a good market, people look beyond things. They don\u2019t see the problems as much,\u201d said Brian Hamilton, co-founder of data firm Sageworks, speaking before the pricing.\n\nThe ride-hailing industry is expected to grow rapidly in the coming years, as young millennials in big cities choose not to buy their own car. Yet the sector is fraught with questions about the future of automated driving, regulatory pushback and legal challenges over drivers\u2019 pay and benefits.\n\nLyft\u2019s valuation makes it the biggest company to go public since Alibaba Group Holding Ltd in 2014. It paves the way for other Silicon Valley companies seeking to float in the stock market this year, including Pinterest Inc, Slack Technologies Inc and Postmates Inc.\n\nLyft raised $2.34 billion its IPO. It said it priced 32.5 million shares, slightly more that it was offering originally, at $72, the top of its already elevated $70-$72 per share target range.

    "description": "The budget gap widened 77 percent compared with the same October-January period a year earlier, according to the Treasury monthly budget report released on Tuesday, which was delayed by the government shutdown.  The financial shortfall is set to widen further\u2026",
    "text": "(Bloomberg) -- The U.S. budget deficit widened to $310 billion in the first four months of the fiscal year, underscoring the revenue hit from Republican tax cuts and an increase in government spending.\n\nThe budget gap widened 77 percent compared with the same October-January period a year earlier, according to the Treasury monthly budget report released on Tuesday, which was delayed by the government shutdown. Receipts fell by 2 percent to $1.1 trillion, while spending rose 9 percent to $1.4 trillion.\n\nThe budget received a bump in customs duties, which almost doubled to about $25 billion, reflecting the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs on Chinese imports, steel and other goods.\n\nThe financial shortfall is set to widen further in the coming years as the Republican tax cut package, which costs about $1.5 trillion over a decade, and increased spending for defense and other priorities boost government outlays. Some policy makers and economists are flagging concern about the growing debt burden, saying it risks America\u2019s credit quality among borrowers, while other economists see more room to run.\n\nTax receipts fell for both corporations and individuals, the Treasury data showed.\n\nThe Congressional Budget Office, a non-partisan federal agency, forecast earlier this year that the budget gap in the fiscal year through September would widen to $897 billion, up by $118 billion from a year earlier.\n\nIn January, the U.S. posted a budget surplus of $8.7 billion, the smallest gain for the month since a shortfall of $17.5 billion was recorded in 2015, according to Treasury data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Katia Dmitrieva in Washington at edmitrieva1@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Scott Lanman at slanman@bloomberg.net, Sarah McGregor, Brendan Murray\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.",

    "title": "'Get rid of the fat': Why Uncle Sam's annual budget is a lot different from yours",
    "description": "The proposed budget President Donald Trump is sending to Congress is far different from that of average Americans, no matter what the politicians say.",
    "text": "CLOSE The federal budget is usually talked about in millions, billions or trillions. We broke it down to a more relatable scale. Video provided by Newsy Newslook\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump\u2019s acting budget director served notice to federal department heads as the administration put together its budget for the coming year:\n\nThe ax will fall hard on spending, so get ready to chop, chop, chop.\n\n\u201cHard-working American families make these sorts of tough decisions every day,\u201d Russ Vought explained in an article published last month on the website RealClearPolitics. \u201cThe president believes Washington should be no different.\u201d\n\nGet it? The federal government is just like you, struggling to make ends meet and forced to live within its means.\n\nExcept it\u2019s not. And it doesn\u2019t.\n\nTrump budget, version 3.0\n\nThe Trump administration sent its third budget to Congress on Monday. As in previous years, the document is landing with a thud. In Washington-speak, it likely will be dead on arrival. (More about that later.)\n\nThe spending plan calls for a 5 percent cut to overall outlays, a 5 percent increase in the Defense Department's budget and $8.6 billion for a border wall just weeks after Congress failed to approve Trump's earlier demand for $5.7 billion for a wall.\n\n\u201cGet rid of the fat, get rid of the waste,\u201d Trump said at an earlier Cabinet meeting. \u201cI\u2019m sure everybody at this table can do it.\u201d\n\nEverybody but the Pentagon, apparently.\n\nPresident Donald Trump will submit his third budget to Congress on Monday. (Photo: Pablo Martinez Monsivais, AP)\n\nCongress gets its say\n\nOne of the big ways the federal budget differs from your household spending plan: You and your family develop your budget without seeking input from 535 other people.\n\nThat\u2019s not how it works in Washington.\n\nThe budget the president sends to Congress is just a starting point, a way for the administration to spell out its spending priorities for the coming year. Lawmakers have their own ideas about how federal dollars should be spent, and since they seldom line up closely with the president\u2019s vision, Congress usually shelves the president\u2019s budget proposal and writes its own.\n\nThe process becomes even more complicated when an opposing party is in charge, as it is this year. Democrats led by Speaker Nancy Pelosi control the House for the first time in eight years, while Republicans still hold the Senate and the White House.\n\nThe president\u2019s budget is usually DOA the moment it reaches Congress. Given the power split, that will be especially true this year.\n\nOptions you don't have with debts\n\nLike many Americans, the federal government spends more money than it has. So, like many Americans, it borrows money to pay its bills.\n\nLots of money.\n\nThe national debt surpassed $22 trillion for the first time last month, a milestone that experts warned is further proof the country is on an unsustainable financial path.\n\nTo put that amount into perspective: The median U.S. household income was $61,372 in 2017, according to the Census Bureau. If every American man, woman and child earned that median wage and gave every penny of it to the government, the total still wouldn't pay off the national debt.\n\nThe federal deficit \u2013 the gap between the government\u2019s income and expenses \u2013 grew by 77 percent over the first four months of the current fiscal year. It\u2019s likely to total $900 billion this fiscal year and hover near or above $1 trillion for the next decade, up from $779 billion last year.\n\nAbout 40 percent of the increase can be traced to the sweeping $1.5 trillion tax cut that Trump spearheaded and that took effect last year, as well as a two-year budget deal that increased government spending by about $300 billion. Growth in Social Security, Medicare and other expenses also swell the deficit.\n\nMany struggling Americans are forced to contend with their own budget deficit and are deep in debt. Americans owe a record $1.04 trillion in credit card debt \u2013 up from less than $854 billion five years ago, according to the Federal Reserve. On average, Americans owe $6,354 on bank-issued credit cards.\n\nBut the federal government has options that average Americans don\u2019t.\n\nIf it needs more money, it can raise taxes. If it needs to borrow, it can get much lower interest rates than consumers can. If it hits its borrowing limit, it can simply raise that ceiling.\n\nIndividual Americans eventually have to pay off their creditors. When you die, your estate settles your debts. Since the federal government doesn\u2019t go away, neither does its debt. It lives on and keeps accumulating.\n\nMore: Don't make these financial mistakes: 10 ways you should never use your credit card\n\nCLOSE Cash may be king, but if that\u2019s true, then credit cards are the ace. Buzz60\n\nWhy you should care\n\nFor average Americans, the federal budget deficit may seem like a massive abstract number that has no effect on their daily lives.\n\nIt does. Or at least it can.\n\nHigher deficits could drive up borrowing costs for U.S. households and businesses. When the government borrows money to pay its bills, it issues Treasury notes. As the supply of Treasurys increases, their prices fall and yields rise to attract more buyers, assuming demand is steady. Those higher rates can ripple across the economy, nudging up rates on mortgages and other loans.\n\nThe big caveat: Though Treasury rates have ticked up as the deficit has widened, they\u2019ve remained at historically low levels (currently about 2.6 percent). That\u2019s because in an uncertain global economy, Treasurys are viewed as a safe bet. While countries such as Turkey, Argentina and Italy face financial crises, no one expects Uncle Sam to default on debt.\n\nThat means the federal government can run up outsize deficits far more easily than ordinary households, which would face credit limits and higher interest rates if they did the same.\n\nThat may not always be the case, especially if $1 trillion deficits continue to pile up and Congress takes no steps to trim them over the longer term. If investors start worrying about that, Treasury rates \u2013 and borrowing costs across the economy \u2013 could begin to edge higher.\n\nAnother reason to fret about the deficit: If the economy slides into another recession, which many analysts predict by 2020, Congress may be less likely to pass a big stimulus to help pull the country out of the doldrums if the package adds to an already-yawning budget gap.\n\nThat could mean more layoffs, fewer job openings and smaller raises for American workers.\n\nMore: 15 ways to make your savings last in retirement and keep pace with inflation\n\nYes, the national debt affects you\n\nOne of the many ways it impacts you is how much you earn.\n\nDebt not only suppresses economic growth, it suppresses future wages. The Congressional Budget Office projects that average income in 30 years will be $5,000 less per year if the national debt continues its trajectory.\n\nThat means average income for a family of four will drop by $16,000 over the next three decades if debt rises as projected, according to the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, a nonpartisan organization dedicated to addressing the country\u2019s long-term fiscal challenges.\n\nIf that happens, you\u2019ll have less money to spend on necessities such as food, gas and clothing or to put extra money in your savings account or 401(k).\n\nRising debt and deficits can lead to higher interest rates. Higher interest rates mean it will cost more to borrow money to buy a house or a car. Paying for college tuition or starting your own business will become more expensive.\n\nHigher interest rates affect credit card purchases, so expenses such as buying gas or groceries or even going on vacation will cost more.\n\nPrograms such as food stamps and unemployment benefits that help the most vulnerable in society could face cuts if the government has less money to spend.\n\nIt may be more difficult to prop up financially strapped programs such as Medicare, which is projected to run out of money by 2026, and Social Security, which is likely to be insolvent by 2034, unless benefits are cut or other steps are taken to shore up the programs.\n\n\u201cThe deficit should matter to anyone who cares about the future of America,\" said Michael A. Peterson, CEO of the Peterson Foundation. \"High and rising debt hurts our ability to build the future we want for the next generation because interest costs have become the fastest growing part of the federal budget.\"\n\nPeterson said that in a few years, interest will exceed what the government spends on children or defense, and it will total $7 trillion over the next 10 years. \"That\u2019s not good for the budget, our economy or our nation\u2019s many priorities,\" he said. \"Failing to manage this debt problem now makes it harder for all Americans down the road.\u201d\n\nIf the United States continues on its trajectory, interest payments on the national debt will amount to the single largest government program within three decades, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.\n\nMore: The national debt and the federal deficit are skyrocketing.

USA TODAY\n\nStock finished lower Friday after a disappointing February jobs report that capped a week of losses for the markets. Investors remain concerned about a global economic slowdown following a string of downbeat news.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial average slipped 23 points, or 0.09 percent, to end at 25,450 on Friday. Its five-day decline this week marked its longest losing streak since June.\n\nThe Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index declined 6 points, or 0.21 percent, to close at 2,743, ending its worst week of the year. The tech-heavy Nasdaq finished down 0.18 percent at 7,408.\n\nMarket watchers got a jolt Friday morning when the Labor Department reported that employers added just 20,000 jobs in February. That was far below the 180,000 Bloomberg consensus and marked the fewest gains since September 2017 when major hurricanes hurt hiring.\n\nThe top analyst upgrades, downgrades and initiations seen on Friday included Abercombie & Fitch, Exxon Mobil, Etsy, GameStop, Kraft Heinz, Netflix, Tilray and Vodafone.

Is it about to flame out or surge higher?\n\nMild weather in January helped to boost gains in that month, while above-average snowfall when the Labor Department conducted its survey in February was predicted to cut total hiring estimates by 40,000, according to Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe unemployment rate fell to 3.8 percent from 4 percent in February, according to the government, as federal workers who identified as unemployed or on temporary leave in January returned to work.\n\nThe report offered a handful of silver linings. Job gains for December and January were revised up by a total 12,000, while average hourly earnings posted a 3.4-percent annual gain, the highest since April 2009.\n\nJobs report winners and losers: Manufacturing workers, black men among losers in February jobs report\n\nRunning a company from behind bars?

A report from The New York Times on Thursday revealed that a broad trade agreement between the U.S. and China is still missing key details, suggesting a final deal is still a ways off.\n\nOther reports this week had revived fears of a weakening global economy.\n\nEarlier this week, the European Central Bank reduced its estimates for economic expansion in the eurozone and decided to inject more stimulus. China's exports dropped by 20.7 percent year over year in February, far more than the estimated 4.8-percent decline.\n\n\u201cWe saw the ECB come out more dovish than it had been, which was a surprise,\u201d said Zaccarelli. \u201cSince it made such an about-face really underscores the weakness there.\u201d\n\nCLOSE John Bogle, who founded the Vanguard Group in 1974 and later was dubbed the \"father of index investing,\" has died at 89.

    "text": "Getty Images Consumers are still confident in the economy, but not as much as they were last summer.\n\nThe numbers: Consumer confidence fell sharply in March, extending a recent up-and-down pattern that reflects greater worries about the U.S. economy.\n\nThe consumer confidence index dropped to 124.1 from 131.4 in February, the Conference Board said Tuesday. That\u2019s the second lowest rate in a year.\n\nEconomists polled by MarketWatch had forecast a 133 reading.\n\nWhat happened: Americans grew less confident in March in the state of business and their ability to find a job, according to a survey of how they felt right now.\n\nThe so-called present situation index sank 12 points 160.6, marking the biggest one-month decline since the middle of the last recession in 2008.\n\nThe pullback in current conditions of the Conference Board Consumer Confidence Survey is significant. The current conditions is an excellent coincident/leading indicator and the peak has presaged recessions by 2-14 months. \u2014 Sri Thiruvadanthai (@teasri) March 26, 2019\n\nAnother measure of how Americans think the economy will be six months from now posted a smaller 4-point drop to 99.8.\n\nWhat they are saying?: \u201cConfidence has been somewhat volatile over the past few months, as consumers have had to weather volatility in the financial markets, a partial government shutdown and a very weak February jobs report,\u201d said Lynn Franco, director of economic indicators at board.\n\n\u201cDespite these dynamics, consumers remain confident that the economy will continue expanding in the near term,\u201d she added. \u201cHowever, the overall trend in confidence has been softening since last summer, pointing to a moderation in economic growth.\u201d\n\nRead: Why the markets aren\u2019t buying the Fed\u2019s claims about the strength of the U.S. economy\n\nBig picture : The U.S. economy slowed toward the end of last year and got off to a sluggish start in 2019. The construction and manufacturing trades have softened and consumer spending has also tapered off.\n\nMost economists predict growth will speed up in the spring in a replay of recent years, but not as rapidly as the economy grew last year. A weaker global economy and persistent trade tensions with China are part of what\u2019s holding the U.S. back.\n\nRead: Home price growth slows to 6.5-year low\n\nRead: The Fed is gun-shy because of a quarter-century of low inflation\n\nMarket reaction: The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.15% and S&P 500 SPX, +0.21% rose sharply in Tuesday trades, but gains were pared after the drop in consumer confidence.\n\nThe 10-year Treasury yield TMUBMUSD10Y, +1.95% was little changed at 2.43%.\n\nMany loans such as mortgages and auto loans are tied to changes in the 10-year note, whose yield has fallen from a seven-year high of 3.23% in October. It closed on Monday at the lowest level since December 2017.",

    "description": "If you want strangers to ask to take a photo with you, walk around in a park ranger\u2019s uniform. As chief ranger at Grand Canyon National Park, Matthew Vandzura knows this well. Even on a winter day, with snow on the ground and only a few dozen tourists at the \u2026",
    "text": "If you want strangers to ask to take a photo with you, walk around in a park ranger\u2019s uniform. As chief ranger at Grand Canyon National Park, Matthew Vandzura knows this well. Even on a winter day, with snow on the ground and only a few dozen tourists at the popular Mather Point outlook, the jovial keeper of the canyon is in high demand. Hardy juniper clings to the ancient rock, a blue-black raven soars above the majestic chasm, and selfie sticks point like fingers toward the open Arizona skies as Vandzura, 51, smiles for snap after snap. On busier days, it\u2019s normal for a line to form.\n\nHis celebrity may be local, but that spotlight has been shining a little more brightly lately, with the centennial celebration of the Feb. 26, 1919, signing of the act that created Grand Canyon National Park. Of course, the canyon itself is much older\u2013to the tune of maybe 6 million years\u2013so a hundred might sound small. But its place as a national institution is grounded in that moment, and what it looks like after the next 100 years is, in part, in the hands of people like Vandzura, who care for the land America has decided is most worth caring for.\n\n\u201cOur primary responsibility is preservation of the park in a way that allows people to enjoy it,\u201d Vandzura says, paraphrasing the 1916 law that established the National Park Service (NPS). They provide opportunities for recreation, he says, \u201cbut in a manner that preserves things for future generations.\u201d At the canyon, those current and future generations are a lot bigger than Teddy Roosevelt could have imagined when he issued his 1903 plea to \u201ckeep this great wonder of nature as it now is.\u201d A record 6.38 million people visited last year. \u201cIt\u2019s well known that Americans love their national parks,\u201d Vandzura says. \u201cWe\u2019re a culture that likes the idea of wide-open spaces.\u201d But that appeal presents a challenge: how to keep natural beauty intact, and visitors in awe, even amid the crowds.\n\nVandzura's advice for park visitors \u201cDon\u2019t go so far that what you remember about your hike is how ridiculously hard it was.\u201d Jesse Rieser for TIME\n\nVandzura doesn\u2019t have a distinct memory of the first time he saw the canyon. But he was 15, on a family road trip, and he remembers the \u201cimmensity\u201d of it. It was on that vacation that he decided to be a backcountry ranger, a goal that took him from a summer gig at a campground in 1988 to jobs including a stint as a seasonal firefighter at Arkansas\u2019 Buffalo National River to a period in urban law enforcement at the St. Louis arch. He landed at Grand Canyon, for the second time, in late 2015.\n\nHere, he faces the question of how to modernize an ancient natural wonder. An education campaign about safe hiking has already reduced the need for search-and-rescue missions. A smart parking system is being designed, a major advance for a village that was built for wagons. Vandzura wants to work even more closely with the Native American communities that call the area home, and convey to tourists that they can take their dollars to the reservations too. An app to reach visitors with such information is in development, though cell service in the park is limited; possibly bringing fiber optic to Grand Canyon Village is also being considered.\n\nThe staff is \u201cdedicated to trying as many things as we can before we limit visitation,\u201d Vandzura says. But they do talk about it, \u201cwhen it\u2019s August and all the parking spaces are filled and people are literally just driving in circles.\u201d\n\nAnd all this is only what Vandzura says constitute micro-level problems. The macro challenges for the next 100 years include everything from uranium mining in the region to management of the dam that controls the flow of the Colorado River through the park. Scientists predict that national parks will, on average, see the impact of climate change more severely than the rest of the U.S. And as the American Southwest faces water shortages, the question of how to both nurture and make use of the river will only become more urgent.\n\nThe Grand Canyon exists on the scale of deep time, and little we humans do can change it; the Grand Canyon exists today and the choices people make will affect its future. Reconciling these two truths can be difficult. But this is a place that has always tested the mind\u2019s perspective. That\u2019s why the park offers visitors mirrored panels called reflectoscopes, used by landscape artists to focus on just a slice at a time of an overwhelming vista. Without some remove, the view is unfathomable. \u201cThe common reaction from friends and family,\u201d Vandzura says, \u201cis that it doesn\u2019t look real.\u201d\n\nA visitor poses for a photo at Grand Canyon National Park on March 1 Jesse Rieser for TIME\n\nBut the mile-deep canyon is very real. And in many ways, taking care of it is just like any job. Back at headquarters, in his spacious but utilitarian office, Vandzura acknowledges that problems facing other industries face the park too. That includes a reckoning with workplace sexual harassment: a shattering 2016 report exposed abuses among park staff who worked the river at Grand Canyon. In the years since, NPS has reworked its antiharassment policy. Separately, park superintendent Christine Lehnertz, who has been seen as a champion of antiharassment measures, was recently investigated for accusations of \u201cbullying and retaliatory behavior,\u201d particularly toward men. A March 5 inspector general\u2019s report found \u201cno evidence\u201d supporting the claims against her.\n\nVandzura is proud of the progress made, although he knows there\u2019s still work to be done. \u201cOur people are more important than our resources,\u201d Vandzura says. \u201cIf you have to decide, you take care of people so you can take care of the mission.\u201d Taking care of people doesn\u2019t just mean worrying about the rangers on his crew. About 3,000 people live between the South Rim and the nearby town of Tusayan\u2013Vandzura and his wife, a retired nurse, included\u2013and the NPS is essentially their only government. That means being chief ranger is like being a small-town police chief. \u201cWe have the same problems in our community that any small town in America has,\u201d Vandzura says, although those problems are filtered through the thin air of the canyon, where isolation means a lack of formal support systems.\n\n\u2018We\u2019re a culture that likes the idea of wide-open spaces,\u2019 says Vandzura Jesse Rieser for TIME\n\nThat duty to the community was apparent during the recent partial government shutdown\u2013the sixth Vandzura has weathered. The park itself stayed open; Arizona law allows the state to donate money to ensure as much, in recognition of its vital economic role. Vandzura says that, because he\u2019s required to have funds in hand before keeping operations going, a member of Arizona Governor Doug Ducey\u2019s staff drove out to meet him on a Saturday with a physical check. Even so, he estimates that more than two-thirds of staff stayed home, and a local pantry distributed 30,000 lb. of food while it lasted. Toilet-paper consumption was used to figure out that more people than usual visited during that time, but rangers couldn\u2019t welcome them, scientific studies paused and maintenance lagged.\n\nSo, like any job, work here can sometimes feel like a slog. The difference is the cure. When it stops feeling like \u201cthe adventure they promised me in the back of the Boys\u2019 Life magazine,\u201d Vandzura just spends some time admiring the scenery he\u2019s there to protect. Unsurprisingly, the Grand Canyon can make a person\u2019s problems seem small. You see that, given enough time, even rocks and rivers change.\n\n\u201cWe are a little blip in geologic time. You still need to do good work for the people who surround you, but it helps put things in perspective,\u201d he says. \u201cEven though it\u2019s empty space, you can still sort of feel it when you\u2019re by yourself out on the edge.\u201d\n\nWrite to Lily Rothman at lily.rothman@time.com.\n\nThis appears in the March 18, 2019 issue of TIME.",

    "text": "(Bloomberg) -- The Democratic-controlled House lost a veto override vote that aimed to halt President Donald Trump\u2019s national emergency plan to fund a border wall, as Republican support for the president handed him a new victory following the end of Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation.\n\nThe 248-181 vote Tuesday was short of the two-thirds majority needed to overturn Trump\u2019s first veto, as most Republicans voted against the resolution despite the public unpopularity of the emergency declaration. The vote kills Democrats\u2019 legislative effort to rein in Trump\u2019s plan to fund a wall on the border with Mexico, and it demonstrates the president\u2019s enduring influence over GOP lawmakers.\n\n\u201cToday, congressional Democrats attempted to block the president\u2019s National Emergency Declaration - they failed,\u201d the White House said in a statement on Tuesday evening. \u201cDemocrats continue to ignore the reality that our porous southern border is a magnet for illegal immigration, child smugglers, human traffickers, drug cartels, gangs and many other criminals.\u201d\n\nThe vote came after Sunday\u2019s massive win for the president when Attorney General William Barr announced that Mueller hadn\u2019t found evidence that the president or his campaign colluded with Russia to interfere with the 2016 election. Barr also said Mueller hadn\u2019t turned up enough evidence to justify a charge of obstructing justice.\n\nThe House and Senate had voted earlier to disapprove Trump\u2019s plan to use an emergency declaration to divert military funds to build the wall. It was a rare bipartisan rebuke of the president, as 13 House Republicans and 12 Senate Republicans joined with Democrats to adopt the resolution, H.J.Res. 46.\n\nYet those votes didn\u2019t come close to the two-thirds margin needed to survive Trump\u2019s March 15 veto, foreshadowing Tuesday\u2019s failed attempt to overturn the president\u2019s action. This time, 14 Republicans joined Democrats in voting for an override.\n\nAfter the override was defeated, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Representative Joaquin Castro of Texas, who wrote the resolution, said in a joint statement that the House and Senate votes against the emergency declaration \u201cwill provide significant evidence for the courts as they review lawsuits.\u201d A coalition of 16 states, led by California, sued the Trump administration last month in an effort to block the declaration.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to review all options to protect our Constitution and our democracy from the president\u2019s assault,\u201d Pelosi and Castro added.\n\nThe failure of the override removes one roadblock from the administration\u2019s effort to secure significant border wall funding from a Congress reluctant to give it to him. After a 35-day partial government shutdown earlier this year over the president\u2019s demand for $5.7 billion in border wall funding, Congress agreed to provide only $1.4 billion for physical barriers.\n\nThe administration plans to use the emergency declaration to redirect $3.5 billion in funding from military construction projects and tap other funding sources that don\u2019t require an emergency declaration. In total, the administration hopes to have $8 billion available to build the border wall.\n\nPelosi had called on lawmakers from both parties to pass the resolution to prevent the president from circumventing Congress\u2019s constitutional authority over spending.\n\n\u201cThis emergency declaration is nothing more than an end run around a majority -- a bipartisan majority -- of both the House and the Senate in complete disregard of our constitutional system of separation of powers,\u201d said Representative Peter DeFazio, an Oregon Democrat.\n\nRepresentative Sam Graves, a Missouri Republican, said in backing Trump, \u201cHe has very clearly laid out the case for a declaration for a national emergency. There is a crisis at the border.\u201d\n\nMost of the 14 Republicans who voted with Democrats to block the emergency declaration have said that while they agreed with the president\u2019s call for border security, his method for securing funding set a bad precedent of executive overreach.\n\nThe president\u2019s declaration also lacks support among the public. A CNN poll conducted March 14-17 found that 50 percent of those questioned agreed with Congress\u2019s resolution disapproving the emergency declaration, while 55 percent said Trump shouldn\u2019t have vetoed the resolution.\n\n(Updates with White House statement, Pelosi statement, beginning in third paragraph.)\n\nTo contact the reporter on this story: Arit John in Washington at ajohn34@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Kevin Whitelaw at kwhitelaw@bloomberg.net, Anna Edgerton, John Harney\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.",

    "text": "HP recalled more batteries in January, but gov shutdown delayed news\n\nBack in January 2018, HP recalled thousands of laptop batteries due to the risk of potentially overheating. The recall was expanded a year later with HP voluntarily recalling a number of additional batteries back in January 2019. The news was slow to reach the public, however, due to the government shutdown, which delayed the Consumer Product Safety Commission\u2019s announcement until March.\n\nHP independently announced the recall expansion on January 17, according to the CPSC, which said that it has only just revealed this information due to the government shutdown, which interfered with its ability to announce the recall itself. As such, the recall is officially dated March 12, 2019, in the US, though news first arose in January.\n\nUnder the expansion, HP is recalling another 78,500 laptop batteries, building upon the 50,000 it recalled in 2018. The reason continues to revolve around the lithium-ion batteries\u2019 potential to overheat, which could cause fires and/or burns. The solution in this case is to replace the potentially faulty batteries.\n\nThe batteries were sold with or as accessories for select laptops and workstations, including some ProBooks models, the HP x360 310 G2, Pavilion x360 11\u2033, the HP ENVY 15, Mobile Thin Clients mt21, mt22, and mt31, and select others. The batteries were sold by HP and its authorized dealers.\n\nAccording to the CPSC, HP has received a total of eight new reports from the US concerning battery packs that overheated, melted, or \u2018charred.\u2019 One report included a \u2018minor injury,\u2019 according to the agency, and two included property damage totaling $1100.

The U.S. trade deficit in January and February reports on home construction, new-home sales and consumer spending were delayed almost an extra month.\n\nSee: MarketWatch Economic Calendar\n\nThese reports won\u2019t and shouldn\u2019t be ignored, though.\n\nHome sales and construction might offer clues on whether the steep drop in mortgage rates since last October is reinvigorating a faltering housing market. That would go a ways in alleviating worries about the economy.\n\nSo would an improvement in consumer spending in January after a big decline in December.\n\nPerhaps most important, the tea-readers of the U.S. economy will get their first look in 2019 at the price barometer the Federal Reserve sees as the best weather vane of inflation.\n\nThe so-called PCE index, like other price indicators, is likely to show declining inflationary pressures early in January. The yearly rate of PCE inflation slowed to 1.7% in December \u2014 the last available figures \u2014 from a six-year high of 2.4% last summer.\n\nRead: The Fed is gun-shy because of a quarter-century of low inflation\n\nSubsiding inflation is what triggered the Fed last week to abandon plans to raise interest rates any more in 2019. The move stunned many on Wall Street who expected the central bank to adopt milder changes in its strategy to safeguard the economy.\n\n\u201cThe Fed got spooked,\u201d said Stephen Stanley, chief economist at Amherst Pierpont Securities.\n\nStocks DJIA, +0.15% SPX, +0.21% plunged on Friday and interest rates sank again TMUBMUSD10Y, +1.95% especially after a round of reports showing further economic weakness in Europe and Japan.\n\nEven though Fed Chairman Jerome Powell described the U.S. economy as being \u201cin a good place,\u201d the decline in inflation can\u2019t be disentangled from a slower growth in the U.S. and abroad.

    "text": "Stocks, bond yields and the dollar fell on news the U.S. economy added 20,000 jobs in February, the fewest in more than a year, while worker pay jumped more than economists predicted. With the S&P 500 on track for its worst week of 2019, here\u2019s what strategists are saying about the unemployment report.\n\nKristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco\n\n\u201cThe February jobs report was abysmal in terms of non-farm payroll but we have to put it in the context of incredibly strong January nonfarm payrolls. However, that is not going to be solace to investors, who have been put on alert by dramatic changes in monetary policy stances by first the Fed and then the Bank of Canada and most recently the European Central Bank. This jobs report will only amplify market worries.\u201d\n\nSameer Samana, senior global market strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute\n\n\u201cIf the weakness continues next month and there\u2019s no revision to this month, it\u2019s a meaningful deceleration in the outlook for the labor market. Given what happened in the fourth quarter, it could be that companies now are at this point at least deciding to really curtail hiring. If there\u2019s going to be all these uncertainties around trade, politics, possibly taxes as we head into the 2020 election cycle, it could be corporations are going look, \u2018I really need to in a more meaningful way start to prepare for the next downturn.\u201d\u2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll probably put downward pressure on stocks, it\u2019ll probably put downward pressure on interest rates. For the dollar, we\u2019ll have to wait and see, but Europe is pretty weak too, so it could be overtime the dollar continues to do OK. And then you\u2019re starting to see gold do better and that\u2019s probably a two-part concern. One, it\u2019s probably concern about a slowdown, and then two, it\u2019s at least speculation around when and if central banks may become even easier. We\u2019re at patient right now, but it could be they start to shift from patient to possibly cutting.

View Sample Sign Up Now\n\nAlec Young, managing director of global markets research at FTSE Russell\n\n\u201cFebruary\u2019s anemic 20,000 new jobs will inevitably exacerbate widespread fears of slowing economic growth, making it harder to be optimistic about corporate earnings. Meanwhile, the 3.4% year-over-year jump in wages represents a growing threat to profit margins. All in all, there\u2019s little in this report to excite investors.\u201d\n\nChad Morganlander, portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors\n\n\u201cThere jobs numbers are noisy because the government shutdown, but it\u2019s clear that the U.S. economy is moderating. You\u2019re seeing this push-pull between dovish monetary policy and deteriorating economic trend. Economic fundamentals will eventually win out, and investors are aware of that. Growth rate decelerates, housing data shows a break in growth, geopolitical concerns are not going away, and investors will wake up to that and sniff out higher recession possibilities.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe world is interconnected with a deceleration of growth on a global basis will start to spill over into U.S. You will probably start to see more economic data not looking good in the course of the next several quarters. Yet you haven\u2019t seen a substantial drop in earnings revisions, where they take the expectations to negative. We would fade the risk-on trade at this point, a great amount of news is backed in, from dovish monetary policy to potential deal on trade.\u201d\n\nJim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Weeden Capital Management\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s enough in the internals of this report, I think, to calm traders down on this number \u2026 It\u2019s not like people weren\u2019t expecting job creation to slow down, so I think that it\u2019s not that shocking that maybe it is a little bit, but if you average out the payroll number and the household number, it comes in at a fairly decent gain.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cIt will become a neutral report here, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re getting around this market right now. We\u2019re getting a mixed bag of bad reports and good reports\u2026at the end of the day, the most you can say out of all of this data is the economy has slowed, which we know, but it\u2019s probably not falling off a cliff, which is also an important part of this. So I think the stock market reaction is not a lot, it was already down quite a bit before this report came out, it hasn\u2019t moved a lot more. I think as the day wears on, it\u2019s going to have more to do with the failing at 4 times at 2800 on the S&P and technicals than it will about these reports.\u2019\u2019\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.",

    "description": "What are the odds that you're facing your own personal financial fallout? Consumer debt hit $4 trillion \u2013 the largest amount ever \u2013 at end of 2018.",
    "text": "CLOSE Cash may be king, but if that\u2019s true, then credit cards are the ace. Buzz60\n\nWe all seem to be on the lookout for clues that we're on the verge of another widespread financial crisis.\n\nThe memories from the debacle a decade ago are so bad that no one wants to be caught by surprise again.\n\nSo many wonder: Is it a sign that a recession is looming because December's retail sales were weak and just posted the biggest drop in nine years? Should we be focused on worries that the United States will be hurt by a global industrial slowdown? What about student loan debt? Delinquent car loans?\n\nYet maybe we should tune into what's next for us, rather than the economy. What are the odds that we could be facing our own personal financial fallout?\n\nAre you juggling so much debt \u2014 and so many bills \u2014 that you're not prepared for your own financial shock? What would happen after a medical emergency? A divorce? A job loss?\n\nSome of the U.S. economic numbers, no doubt, give one reason to pause.\n\nConsumer debt at all-time high\n\nConsumer debt in total hit a little more than $4 trillion \u2014 the largest amount ever \u2014 as of December 2018, according to the latest data from the Federal Reserve. That includes auto loans, student loans, personal loans, credit cards but not mortgages.\n\nRising student loan balances, increasing credit card debt and more car loans drove outstanding consumer debt to $4 trillion by December 2018, the largest level ever. Outstanding household debt -- including mortgages -- $13.54 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The increase marks the 18th consecutive quarter of debt growth. (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nA record number of consumers \u2014 some 178.6 million at the end of 2018 \u2014 now have access to a credit card, according to a new report by TransUnion.\n\nNearly 430 million credit cards are in circulation \u2014 up nearly 13 percent from the end of 2015.\n\nThe average credit card debt per borrower is $5,736 \u2014 up about 7.5 percent from 2015, according to TransUnion.\n\nIn the past year or so, 4 million more people gained access to a credit card.\n\nPaul Siegfried, senior vice president and credit card business leader at TransUnion, called the uptick as sign of deliberate growth in a fiercely competitive credit card industry.\n\n\"Issuers are very deliberate in how they extend credit based upon the market competition,\" Siegfried said.\n\nMore subprime borrowers have credit cards\n\nMuch of the growth has been driven by a pickup in consumers with subprime credit \u2014 those with credit scores of 600 or lower \u2014 gaining access to a credit card. Some of that growth involves younger consumers, including millennials, who are opening credit cards and have lower credit scores because they have little credit history.\n\nBut Siegfried noted that balance growth was high at the opposite end of the spectrum, too, including consumers with \"super prime\" credit scores of 781 or higher under the VantageScore 3.0 credit scoring model.\n\nWhile serious delinquency rates for credit card debt \u2014 defined as 90 days past due \u2014 rose to 1.94 percent, the rates are well below delinquencies during the Great Recession, according to TransUnion.\n\nGoing back to the fourth quarter of 2009 \u2014 a peak time for financial troubles \u2014 the delinquency rate for credit cards was 2.97 percent.\n\nSiegfried said he wouldn't call the growth good or bad at this point.\n\nHe noted that year-end delinquencies tend to go up for credit cards, as people are juggling various bills during the holidays.\n\nIn general, TransUnion sees consumers continuing to have a strong appetite for credit, as well as an overall strong record when it comes to repaying their debt.\n\nMore: Smaller tax refunds mean some won't catch up on bills\n\nMore: Retiring with debt? More Americans are. Here are some strategies\n\nClearly, though, some consumers are feeling more financial pressure.\n\nMillennials most likely to carry a balance\n\nAbout 35 percent of those who carry credit card debt said it's because of emergency expenses like car repairs, medical bills or home repairs, according to a report by CreditCards.com.\n\nAbout 56 percent of those who are carrying balances have been doing so for more than a year, according to that same survey.\n\nMillennials are most likely to carry credit card debt. The survey said 65 percent of those between the ages of 23 to 38 are most likely to be carrying balances, mainly for day-to-day expenses.\n\nMany times, those who run into financial problems start unraveling because of some unexpected personal problem \u2014 not always a big macro-economic shift.\n\nSome 40 million Americans \u2014 or 16 percent of adults \u2014 think they will miss at least one credit card due date in 2019, according to a WalletHub credit cards survey.\n\n\"It's people that have been living paycheck to paycheck and there is this final blow or shock,\" said Donna McNeill, chief operating officer for GreenPath Financial Wellness, a national nonprofit based in Farmington Hills.\n\nLiving paycheck to paycheck\n\nWhile people may be making minimum payments on time, they're still not on a stable financial footing. The debt keeps building.\n\n\"People can get in the cycle of making the minimum payments and still getting deeper and deeper in debt,\" McNeill said.\n\nIf a credit card borrower only made the minimum payments on $5,000 of debt, for example, they'd be in debt for more than 18 years and would end up paying $6,372 in interest based on national average interest rates, according to Ted Rossman, industry analyst for CreditCards.com.\n\nSince middle 2018, GreenPath said its seen an increase in client calls and a need for debt management assistance. The average GreenPath client is managing about $25,000 in debt.\n\nUnder a GreenPath debt management plan, clients reduce interest, pay off principal faster, and aim to get out of debt in four to five years. Plan fees vary, depending on the amount of debt. The average fee is $35 a month. But GreenPath said often the reduction in interest paid makes up for the fee.\n\nTrouble might be triggered by a change in job and income, the federal government shutdown, layoff, medical situation or lifestyle change.\n\n\"The personal financial crisis is what's driving folks seeking assistance,\" said David Flores, director of client services for GreenPath.\n\nMany times, people cannot just look only at one type of debt, such as credit cards.\n\nPeople aged 18 to 44 are most worried about missing credit card payments, according to WalletHub.\n\nThe 45 year-old to 59-year-old demographic is most concerned about their mortgages, according to WalletHub's research, while those over 59 put tax payments as their biggest worry.\n\n\n\nYet one needs to take into account the entire financial picture \u2014 including student loans, auto loans, personal loans, credit cards, tax bills, as well as a mortgage.\n\n\"Someone may call us with a 'pain-point' but we're always going to look at the full financial picture,\" Flores said.\n\nHow to get on better financial footing\n\nA good starting point is to carefully review how much money is coming into a household and how much is being spent each month \u2014 and look seriously into any short falls.\n\nTry to pay off credit card bills with high interest rates \u2014 or see if you can negotiate a lower rate. Retail store cards tend to have higher rates than other cards, so pay attention to how you charge purchases.\n\nYou want to make sure you pay all bills on time in order to maintain a higher credit score and access to lower rate loans.\n\nMcNeill said consumers should contact creditors before payments are missed, ask for options to reduce interest rate, and look into any short-term hardship program.\n\nIf all your credit card bills and loans are due on the 15th every month, it may be wise to ask that a lender change payment date to make your bills more manageable.\n\nIt's also possible to successfully request to get a late fee waived, especially if that's a first-time experience.\n\nThere also may be payment assistance programs \u2014 such as income-driven repayment plans \u2014 to deal with student loans as well.\n\nWhile many study the big headlines \u2014 such as layoff news out of General Motors or the federal government shutdown \u2014 it's important to focus on your own financial outlook, too.\n\nContact Susan Tomporat 313-222-8876 or stompor@freepress.com.

    "description": "Four Republican Senators plan to vote for a resolution to block President Trump's national emergency declaration at the souther border.",
    "text": "CLOSE President Trump declared a national emergency to free up funding for his border wall between the U.S and Mexico. But declaring a national emergency isn\u2019t new -- in fact, the use of emergency powers is older than the country itself. USA TODAY, Just the FAQs\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 President Donald Trump has tweeted that \"Senate Republicans are not voting on constitutionality or precedent\" when a resolution to block his emergency declaration at the U.S.-Mexico border comes to the Senate floor.\n\nBut the Republican senators who plan to break ranks and vote with Democrats in favor of the resolution on Thursday say precedent and constitutionality are precisely what they are voting on.\n\nTrump announced he was declaring a national emergency at the border after Congress refused to appropriate the $5.7 billion he wanted for construction of a border wall. Many congressional Republicans have joined Democrats in objecting to the move, which they saw as using emergency powers to bypass Congress\u2019 constitutional authority over spending.\n\nMild rebuke or open revolt?: Border wall emergency vote a test of Trump's strength\n\nSenate Republicans are not voting on constitutionality or precedent, they are voting on desperately needed Border Security & the Wall. Our Country is being invaded with Drugs, Human Traffickers, & Criminals of all shapes and sizes. That\u2019s what this vote is all about. STAY UNITED! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 6, 2019\n\nFive Republicans have said they will vote for the resolution. With all 47 Democratic senators expected to vote for it, their support means the resolution will likely be approved.\n\nTrump repeated his vow to veto the measure in a tweet Thursday. It is unlikely Congress would be able to secure the votes needed to override a veto, which requires the support of two-thirds of the lawmakers in each chamber.\n\n'I didn't need to do this': Critics say Trump quote undercuts national emergency for border wall\n\nHere are the Republican senators who have said they plan to vote for the Democratic resolution:\n\nSusan Collins, Maine\n\nSen. Susan Collins is one of two Republicans who plan to vote for the resolution who are also up for re-election in 2020. The New England moderate has bucked her party on other occasions, such as when she voted with Democrats to block Affordable Care Act repeal efforts in 2017.\n\nShe said Trump\u2019s decision to declare a border emergency after Congress denied him funding for a wall, \"strikes me as undermining the appropriations process, the will of Congress and of being of dubious constitutionality.''\n\nMike Lee, Utah\n\nSen. Mike Lee became the fifth Republican to announce he would vote for the resolution after talks between GOP senators and the White House failed to reach a compromise a day before the scheduled vote.\n\n\"We tried to cut a deal, the president didn\u2019t appear interested,\" Lee told The Hill. \"I\u2019ll be voting 'yes.'\"\n\nLike the other Republican senators who plan to oppose Trump's move, Lee expressed concern about the precedent set by Trump's declaration.\n\n\"Congress has been giving far too much legislative power to the executive branch,\" Lee told The Associated Press.\n\nLisa Murkowski, Alaska\n\nThe daughter of former Alaska governor and senator Frank Murkowski, Sen. Lisa Murkowski has not been afraid to work independently of her party, even winning a write-in campaign after losing her party\u2019s primary in 2010. She was also the lone Republican to oppose Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation.\n\n\"When you use the National Emergencies Act to effectively expand executive powers by legislative acquiescence, I think that sets a dangerous precedent, and I don't think that it's a path that we should take,\" Murkowski told PBS \"Newshour\" on Wednesday.\n\nRand Paul, Kentucky\n\nFor the libertarian-leaning Sen. Rand Paul, opposition to Trump's border emergency declaration is in large measure a matter of ideological principle.\n\n\"I can\u2019t vote to give the president the power to spend money that hasn\u2019t been appropriated by Congress,\" Paul told a gathering of Kentucky Republicans, according to the Bowling Green Daily News. \"We may want more money for border security, but Congress didn\u2019t authorize it. If we take away those checks and balances, it\u2019s a dangerous thing.\"\n\nThom Tillis, North Carolina\n\nSen. Tom Tillis is the other senator up for re-election in 2020 who has said he will vote to block Trump\u2019s emergency declaration.\n\n\"As a U.S. senator, I cannot justify providing the executive with more ways to bypass Congress,\" Tillis wrote in an op-ed in The Washington Post. \"As a conservative, I cannot endorse a precedent that I know future left-wing presidents will exploit to advance radical policies that will erode economic and individual freedoms.\"\n\nContributing: Deborah Barfield Berry, Michael Collins and John Fritze, USA TODAY; The Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/03/07/republican-senators-voting-to-block-border-emergency-declaration/3089784002/",

    "text": "Getty Images The U.S. economy has gotten off to a shaky start again early in the year, but don\u2019t expect it to tilt into recession.\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt the economy is laboring through a tough stretch. The big question is whether it gets worse before it gets better.\n\nBet on growth speeding up. The economy has repeatedly started a new year off slowly since the U.S. exited its last recession in mid-2009. And growth has usually picked up in the spring.\n\nThe same pattern seems ready to re-emerge, and early hints might come this week from the first batch of reports on how the economy is performing in March.\n\nSee: MarketWatch Economic Calendar\n\nGross domestic product, the official scorebook for the economy, is forecast to accelerate to a 2.5% annual pace in the spring from an estimated 1.5% in the first quarter, according to the latest MarketWatch roundup of economists.\n\nPretty good, if it works out that way, but not as good as last year. GDP soared to 4.2% in the second quarter of 2018 after growing just half as fast in the opening three months.\n\nThe main difference between this year and last? There\u2019s no big tax cuts or spending increases on tap in Washington. The economy got a big boost last spring through the generous hand of Congress and the White House.\n\nRead: Prescription drug prices aren\u2019t rising \u2014 they\u2019re falling for the first time in 47 years\n\nStill, the economy isn\u2019t exactly suffering from a lack of support.\n\nThe Federal Reserve, for example, announced in late January it was scrapping plans to raise interest rates again anytime soon. That caused interest rates on business loans, mortgage and other consumer goods to tumble. Look for home sales in particular to perk up again.\n\nThe stock market DJIA, +0.15% , SPX, +0.21% meanwhile, has recovered from a harrowing plunge in December. Consumer confidence rebounded after the market meltdown and partial government shutdown. And the unemployment rate slipped to 3.8% in February, reflecting the strongest labor market in decades.\n\nA robust labor market all but assures households will continue to drive the economy forward. Consumers have been spending a bit less than they\u2019ve earned the past several months, but that\u2019s unlikely to last.\n\nHow come? Spending over time tends to track gains in income very closely \u2014 and wages are rising more than 3% a year.\n\n\u201cRemember that consumer spending is responsible for close to 70% of U.S. GDP,\u201d noted Scott Wren, senior global equity strategist at Wells Fargo Investment Institute.\n\nRead: First-quarter slump won\u2019t snowball into something worse, JPMorgan\u2019s Feroli says\n\nThe icing on the cake could be a U.S. deal with China that resolves a tense trade dispute that has put business leaders on edge and disrupted the economies of both countries. Business investment in the U.S. started to slow right when the dispute heated up last summer and it hasn\u2019t fully recovered.\n\nRead: Bill Gates finds an ally in Washington for taxing robots: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\n\nEven with those tailwinds at its back, the economy probably won\u2019t grow as fast as it did last year.\n\nThe Fed is widely expected to trim its 2.3% GDP forecast in 2019 by a tick or two at its two-day meeting to review the state of the economy.\n\nThe U.S. expanded 2.9% last year to match a post-recession high.",

    "description": "U.S.-priced oil slipped again Thursday, deepening its pullback from the closely watched $60 mark as domestic supply data surprised with a gain and a degree of demand uncertainty nags this market.",
    "text": "Oil futures fell on Thursday but finished off the session\u2019s lows, as U.S. President Donald Trump called on OPEC to lift output, as recent domestic supply data surprised with a gain, and because global growth concerns fed uncertainty over energy demand.\n\nIn a tweet Thursday morning, Trump again called for more supply on global markets and said the price of oil was \u201cgetting too high.\u201d Prices have rallied by some 25% year to date as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies have said they remain committed to their pledge to curb production.\n\nVery important that OPEC increase the flow of Oil. World Markets are fragile, price of Oil getting too high. Thank you! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 28, 2019\n\nOil prices had momentarily suffered a steep, sudden, decline Thursday morning, just as Trump\u2019s tweet came out, and as data showing the U.S. economy grew a slower 2.2% in the fourth quarter were released, feeding concerns over a slowdown in energy demand. A recent slump in Treasury yields \u2014 and an inversion of the yield curve \u2014 has underlined those economic worries.\n\nPrices recouped most of those earlier losses, however. West Texas Intermediate crude for May delivery CLK9, -0.05% on the New York Mercantile Exchange lost 11 cents, or 0.2%, to settle at $59.30 a barrel, after trading as low as $58.20. International benchmark May Brent crude UK:LCOK9 which expires at Friday\u2019s settlement, fell a penny to $67.82 a barrel on ICE Futures Europe.\n\nOil had finished lower on Wednesday after the U.S. Energy Information Administration revealed that U.S. crude supplies unexpectedly rose by 2.8 million barrels for the week ended March 22.\n\n\u201cWhile the build is significant shift in the immediate term, some near-term supply volatility is to be expected following recent fires at outages that have impacted refiners in the Houston area,\u201d said Robbie Fraser, global commodity analyst at Schneider Electric. \u201cThe broader trend continues to see total stocks erasing their surplus to the five-year average, particularly as the market starts to shift into the summer demand season.\u201d\n\nFutures prices remain solidly higher year to date on signs of reduced global supplies on the back of efforts by major oil producers to curb production. Members of OPEC and other major oil producers, including Russia, have pledged to curb crude production by around 1.2 million barrels a day from October levels for the first half of this year to prop up markets.\n\n\u201cOil remains well supported at these levels by continued OPEC output cuts and [U.S.] sanctions on Iran and Venezuela,\u201d said Jasper Lawler, head of research with London Capital Group.\n\nWorries surrounding another power outage in Venezuela should start to raise concerns about a shutdown of Venezuelan oil output, analysts have stressed.\n\nRussia has trailed in implementing production cuts agreed to with OPEC members in December, but Citi, in a report, said there is growing confidence Russia will have stepped up its response by the next meeting in June. Citi analysts estimate Russia\u2019s daily production this month will average 11.3 million barrels, 120,000 above agreed-to targets.\n\nMeanwhile, Citi lifted its 2019 average price forecast on Brent by 9.4% to $70 a barrel, citing tighter supplies.\n\nAmong the products traded on Nymex, April gasoline RBJ9, +0.40% settled at $1.880 a gallon, down 0.8%, while April heating oil HOJ9, -0.14% shed 0.4% to $1.972 a gallon. The April contracts expire Friday.\n\nMay natural gas NGK19, -0.11% fell 0.3% to $2.712 per million British thermal units on its first full session as a front-month contract.\n\nThe EIA reported Thursday that domestic supplies of natural gas fell by 36 billion cubic feet for the week ended March 22.

    "text": "It\u2019s unclear what legislative issues may consume Congress between now and the end of September but one thing\u2019s for sure: President Trump\u2019s veto of a measure to terminate his national emergency for the border has the potential to spark another government shutdown on Oct. 1.\n\nYes, the president and Congress just sparred over the border wall during the 35-day shutdown which ended this past January. They could be back at it again soon because Trump elected to go around Congress, testing the limits of the Constitution and separation of powers, and mining appropriations bills for wall money.\n\nIt was thought that the bipartisan attitude on Capitol Hill which forged a funding agreement could generate cooperation and goodwill heading into Fiscal Year 2020. But, President Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration may have doomed any charity left in Congress.\n\nThe House and Senate lack the votes to override Trump\u2019s veto. The House is about 40 votes shy. The Senate is eight votes off the mark. The House is still set to try the override on March 26, but it's almost certain the override endeavor will perish there -- and President Trump will use his declaration to use various military funds to cover the cost of the wall unless blocked by a federal court.\n\nNow the administration has presented lawmakers with a list which details a pool of military projects from which it may use cash to pay for the wall. The administration has called the clump of money \u201cunobligated.\u201d It amounts to $12.9 billion.\n\n\u201cHe is planning to take funds from real, effective operational priorities and needed projects and divert them to his vanity wall. That may help shore up his political base, but it could come at the expense of our military bases and the men and women of our Armed Forces who rely on them,\u201d said Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., the top Democrat on the Armed Services Committee.\n\nCongress is just starting to prepare the 12 appropriations bills which fund the government for FY \u201820. Almost all Democrats, and frankly, many Republicans, have described Trump\u2019s effort to bypass Congress as brazen. Lawmakers of both parties have guarded Congressional prerogatives of the purse closely, so it's likely a bipartisan group of lawmakers will start to install restrictions to curb the president from diverting funds in the next spending round \u2013 without direct Congressional approval.\n\nTherein lies the rub.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s budget request calls for $8.6 billion in wall funding for FY \u201820. Congress likely will grant the president some of the money \u2013 but not all. Will he attempt to sidestep Congress again? Will Trump veto bills where Congress tries to re-assert its power of the purse or curb his ability to circumvent the traditional appropriations process? That\u2019s where a possible shutdown comes in.\n\nMeantime, it's unclear what Congress can tackle the rest of the year.\n\nInfrastructure? No action. Washington recently saw another \u201cinfrastructure week\u201d but there was no sign of any progress.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of talk about trade, but the administration hasn\u2019t yet forged a formal agreement with China. Negotiators did ink a pact with Canada and Mexico to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Still, there\u2019s no timetable for the House or Senate to consider the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA). U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer met last week with House Democrats, but it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess when or if anything could move through Congress on trade.\n\nThe agenda in the Senate focuses mostly on the confirmation of judges and other administration nominees. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has a few more queued up for next week, but the actual GOP agenda is unclear.\n\nTax reform is done, for good or ill. Republicans can\u2019t go back to take yet another stab at repealing and replacing ObamaCare, so the GOP is trained on problems of the Democrats. McConnell, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., and House Republican Conference Chairwoman Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., routinely have pilloried Dems over their own internal divides. GOP leaders simply have pointed out issues Democrats have had with Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, among others. The House Republican leadership brass routinely has gone after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., for not doing more to keep the conduct of Omar and Tlaib in check.\n\nBORDER PATROL UNION LEADER: CONGRESS IS WRONG, NATIONAL EMERGENCY ON THE BORDER IS REAL\n\nMcConnell\u2019s set up a procedural vote to try starting debate next week on the Green New Deal, backed by Ocasio-Cortez and others. The Senate needs 60 yeas just to launch debate.\n\nSenate Republicans certainly don\u2019t support the Green New Deal. McConnell\u2019s gambit is to get Democrats on the record as either supporting or rejecting the measure. Consider all of the Senate Democrats running for President: Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kamala Harris of California and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota -- not to mention Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. McConnell clearly would love to register a roll call vote on where Democrats stand in favor of the Green New Deal. Then, Republicans could crow about how radical and out-of-step the Democrats have been.\n\nOr, McConnell also would enjoy Democrats opposing the Green New Deal. He then could exclaim that Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s blueprint was too drastic even for the most liberal and environmentally friendly voices in the Democratic party. Either way, McConnell would get something he's wanted.\n\nBut, it\u2019s unclear whether he would score something definitive. The vote set for next week is just a procedural vote. It\u2019s two steps away from an actual up-or-down vote on the underlying measure. Any vote to start debate -- or to prevent the measure from coming to the floor -- is muddled when it comes to messaging. Sure, McConnell could say that Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s resolution was too far-flung to merit debate. But, that\u2019s not the strongest argument to make in politics.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThis is why the legislative agenda on Capitol Hill is so jumbled. There\u2019s no clear path on what the sides can accomplish in the coming months. There will be a fight over lifting the debt ceiling this summer. How the sides resolve that is unclear. And the national emergency declaration likely will create yet another standoff over the border wall in September.\n\nIn other words, the rest of 2019 could reflect how the year started.",

The outlook for 2020 is even more bleak, with the Fed now projecting growth of just 1.9 percent.\n\nThe downbeat assessment comes as the Fed sees signs of weakness in areas like consumer spending and business investment, which Mr. Powell said \u201csuggest that growth is slowing somewhat more than expected.\u201d Average monthly job growth, while strong, \u201cappears to have stepped down from last year\u2019s strong pace,\u201d he added.",

    "description": "The next concern: Economists worry that lawmakers will fail to reach a debt-ceiling deal.",
    "text": "The longest government shutdown in history is now history--but its impact on the economy may linger well into the year.\n\nAccording to estimates by the Congressional Budget Office, the 35-day partial shutdown that ended January 25 will ding the U.S. economy by about $3 billion. But Tony Roth, chief investment officer at Wilmington Trust, says the actual damage could be two to three times higher than the CBO's $3 billion figure. That's because the CBO looked at only the direct costs of the shutdown, not the harder-to-measure indirect costs, such as travel plans that were called off or executives who delayed or canceled spending to maintain or expand their businesses.\n\nRoth says he still has a positive view of the economy and the U.S. stock market, although he reduced his outlook for gross domestic product growth by 0.2 percentage point, to a range of 2% to 2.25% for 2019. That revised GDP forecast, which is below Kiplinger's 2.45% forecast, takes into account not only the shutdown but other issues, such as China's slowing economy and the impact of tariffs.\n\nA more worrisome effect of the shutdown is that it foreshadows more dysfunction in Washington that could affect trade pacts and Uncle Sam's borrowing power. The Treasury Department is expected to have enough money to pay the bills only until mid to late summer. If lawmakers don't raise the debt ceiling at that point, the country will default on its obligations, which would be \"near catastrophic for the global economy,\" Roth says.\n\nBut Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, doesn't think that will happen. \"This experience with the shutdown and the political fallout make it less likely they'll play brinkmanship around the debt limit,\" Zandi says.\n\nA hit to consumer confidence. As the shutdown dragged on for weeks, consumers were made acutely aware of how entwined their lives are with the federal gov\u00adernment. The shutdown threatened to delay tax refunds and mortgage closings, stopped food safety inspections, and disrupted travel, leading to long airport security lines and causing a brief halt in flights at LaGuardia because the airport didn't have enough air traffic controllers.\n\nThose events, on top of stories about federal workers and contractors at risk of losing their homes as they struggled to get by without paychecks, likely contributed to a plunge in consumer confidence. The Conference Board reported a much larger than expected drop in consumer confidence in January, the third monthly decline in a row.\n\nConsumer confidence is key to a healthy economy because consumer spending accounts for 70% of the U.S. economy. Economists say the shutdown may lead to increased savings and reduced spending among some of the 800,000 federal workers whose paychecks were delayed, as well as the hundreds of thousands of federal contractors and service providers who won't get back pay. And it may cause others to prepare for a financial shock, too. But the shutdown is unlikely to dampen consumer spending overall, economists say.\n\nThere is one silver lining to the shutdown: Democrats and Republicans in Congress have introduced legislation to ban shutdowns.\n\nEDITOR'S PICKS\n\n\n\nCopyright 2019 The Kiplinger Washington Editors",

(Photo: Rachel Leingang/The Republic)\n\nArgosy University and its parent company altered submissions to the U.S. Department of Education to get access to student financial aid funds, which were then spent on other expenses, a court document filed on Monday claims.\n\nThe filing, made on behalf of Argosy's court-appointed receiver, Mark Dottore, said the receiver and the department didn't know the submissions were not accurate.\n\nArgosy and Dream Center Education Holdings, the parent company, were \"altering their submissions to the DOE to reflect that the student stipend had been paid when in fact it had not been paid,\" the filing from Mary Whitmer, Dottore's attorney, states.\n\nThe altered submissions led the Department of Education to send millions in financial aid funds to Argosy and Dream Center. Money that should have gone to students apparently was spent on other expenses, like payroll.\n\n\"Once the money was received, Argosy and DCEH voided their bookkeeping entries that showed the student had been paid and paid operating expenses with the money rather than paying the student stipend,\" Whitmer wrote.\n\nThe filing comes after students at Argosy campuses across the country say they were not paid financial aid funds. Some are missing thousands of dollars used to pay living expenses like transportation and rent.\n\nStudents have described missing bill payments, not buying groceries and taking out high-interest loans to cope with the lack of funds.\n\nStudents often receive financial aid that covers living expenses as well as tuition. The tuition payment and additional funds would both go to the university, which would then give the overage amount directly to the student.\n\nIn total, Argosy students at all campuses are owed about $13 million in financial aid funds.\n\nOn Feb. 27, the Department of Education announced it would no longer allow Argosy to receive federal financial aid funds.

The department also denied a request from Dream Center to convert Argosy properties from for-profit to nonprofit when it cut the school off from federal aid.\n\nThe school has a site in Phoenix, though no longer has a campus. Instead, students are using classrooms at Ottawa University.\n\nCash monitoring required pre-paying\n\nArgosy was placed on \"heightened cash monitoring 1\" at the time it claimed it had paid students' financial aid.\n\nTypically, a school would receive the entire loan amount, including the tuition and excess funds, from the Department of Education.\n\nBut, because of the cash monitoring status, Argosy was required to pay student stipends first from its own money, then provide proof of these payments to the department, which would then reimburse the school.\n\nArgosy changed its submissions to make it appear it had paid out students, the filing says.\n\nThe Department of Education previously told The Republic it sent about $15 million in January, most of it just days before the receiver took charge of the school's books.\n\nWant more news like this? Subscribe to azcentral.com.\n\n\"Significant funds have been released from the department since mid-January that should have been used to pay the existing unpaid credit balances owed to students,\u201d department spokeswoman Liz Hill wrote to the Republic in February.\n\nWhen the receiver was appointed in January, he believed the delayed student funds stemmed from the department's cash-monitoring regulations that Argosy had to pay students first, the filing says.\n\nAfter talks with the department broke down, the receiver \"investigated and determined the true facts,\" Whitmer wrote.\n\nThe receiver needs time to complete a \"proper, detailed investigation\" and determine the timing of the misappropriation of funds, who signed the requests to the department, who knew about it and how exactly the money was used, Whitmer wrote.\n\nWhat the receiver is doing\n\nThe receiver said there was a total of $5.4 million in all bank accounts under his control when he took over the company's finance, the filing says, far less than the $13 million owed to students.\n\n\"When the receiver was appointed, the money was already mostly gone,\" Whitmer wrote.\n\nSince taking over, he has taken \"immediate and drastic steps\" to try to improve the company's financial situation, she wrote.\n\nTo cut costs, the receiver has laid off more than 1,100 employees and totally shut down a Chandler facility. That 100,000-square-foot building housed services for various Dream Center campuses, and its monthly rent was more than $366,000, Whitmer wrote. The receiver also has not paid landlords, the filing says.\n\nThe receiver is now \"actively\" pursuing talks with \"15 different potential purchasers\" for Dream Center sites, including six potential buyers for Argosy, Whitmer wrote.\n\n\"These discussions are critical because one of the best ways to avoid harm to students is to transition the campuses to other owners,\" she wrote.\n\nWhat should students do?\n\nIf the college eventually closes, students may also be eligible for Closed School Discharge.\n\nBut, if students graduate from Argosy or transfer credits to a comparable program at another school, they would not be eligible for the Closed School Discharge.\n\nExperts also suggest getting copies of transcripts before a college closes, as it may become harder after closure.\n\nReach reporter Rachel Leingang by email at rachel.leingang@gannett.com or by phone at 602-444-8157, or find her on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nSupport local journalism.

    "title": "Project Syndicate: How to understand the Fed\u2019s dovish turn",
    "description": "Nouriel Roubini explains what\u2019s behind the Federal Reserve\u2019s sudden about-face on raising interest rates.",
    "text": "Getty Images Fed Chairman Jerome Powell\n\nNEW YORK (Project Syndicate) \u2014 The Federal Reserve surprised markets recently with a large and unexpected policy change. When the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) met in December 2018, it hiked the Fed\u2019s policy rate to 2.25-2.5%, and signaled that it would raise the benchmark rate another three times, to 3%-3.25%, before stopping.\n\nIt also signaled that it would continue to unwind its balance sheet of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities indefinitely, by up to $50 billion per month.\n\nBut just six weeks later, at the FOMC meeting in late January, the Fed indicated that it would pause its rate hikes for the foreseeable future and suspend its balance-sheet unwinding sometime this year.\n\nRelated: Fed expected to explain how and when it will stop shedding balance-assets\n\nSeveral factors drove the Fed\u2019s volte-face.\n\nFirst and foremost, policy makers were rattled by the sharp tightening in financial conditions after the FOMC\u2019s December meeting, which hastened a rout in global equity markets GDOW, +0.60% that had begun in October 2018. And these fears were exacerbated by an appreciating U.S. dollar BUXX, -0.06% and the possibility of an effective shutdown of certain credit markets, particularly those for high-yield and leveraged loans.\n\nSecond, in the latter half of 2018, U.S. core inflation unexpectedly stopped rising toward the Fed\u2019s 2% target, and even started falling toward 1.8%. With inflation expectations weakening, the Fed was forced to reconsider its rate-hike plan, which was based on the belief that structurally low unemployment would drive inflation above 2%.\n\nThird, President Donald Trump\u2019s trade wars and slowing growth in Europe, China, Japan, and emerging markets have raised concerns about the United States\u2019 own growth prospects, particularly after the protracted federal government shutdown with which the U.S. met the New Year.\n\nFourth, the Fed has had to demonstrate its independence in the face of political pressures. In December, when it signaled further rate hikes, Trump had been calling for a pause. But since then, the Fed has had to worry about being blamed in the event of an economic stall.\n\nFifth, Richard Clarida, a well-respected economist and market expert, joined the Fed Board as vice chair in the fall of 2018, tipping the balance of the FOMC in a more dovish direction.\n\nBefore then, Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s own dovish tendencies had been kept in check by a slightly less dovish staff and the third member of the Fed\u2019s leadership troika, New York Fed President John Williams, who expected inflation to rise gradually above target as the labor market tightened.\n\nThe addition of Clarida amid stalling inflation and tightening financial conditions no doubt proved decisive in the Fed\u2019s decision to hit the pause button. But Clarida also seems to have pushed the Fed toward renewed dovishness in more subtle ways.\n\nFor starters, his presence lends support to Powell\u2019s view that the flattening of the Phillips curve (which asserts an inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment) may be more structural than temporary. Some Fed researchers disagree, and have published a paper arguing that uncertainty with respect to the Phillips curve should not stop the Fed from normalizing monetary policy.\n\nBut with Clarida\u2019s input, the Fed will be more inclined to focus on actual inflation trends, rather than on the official unemployment rate and its implications under traditional models.\n\nMoreover, while Fed staff members tend to believe that the U.S. economy\u2019s rate of potential growth is very low (around 1.75%-2%), Clarida, like Powell, seems open to the idea that Trump\u2019s tax cuts and deregulatory policies, combined with the next wave of technological innovation, will allow for somewhat stronger non-inflationary growth.\n\nFinally, Clarida is spearheading an internal strategy review to determine whether the Fed should start making up for below-target inflation during recessions and slow recoveries by allowing for above-target inflation during expansionary periods.\n\nAnd though the review is still in its early stages, the Fed already seems to have embraced the idea that inflation should be allowed to exceed 2% without immediately triggering a tightening.\n\nTaken together, these factors suggest that the Fed could remain in pause mode for the rest of 2019.\n\nAfter all, even a recent modest acceleration of wage growth does not seem to have produced higher inflation, implying that the Phillips curve may stay flatter for longer. And, given the Fed\u2019s new de facto policy of targeting average inflation over the course of the business cycle, a modest, temporary increase in core inflation above 2% would not necessarily be met with policy action.\n\nBut while the Fed is most likely to remain in a holding pattern for the bulk of 2019, another rate hike toward the end of the year or in 2020 cannot be ruled out.\n\nChina\u2019s growth slowdown seems to be bottoming out, and recovery there could start to strengthen in the coming months, especially if the current Sino-American negotiations lead to a de-escalation of trade tensions.\n\nLikewise, a deal to avert an economically disastrous \u201chard Brexit\u201d could still be in the offing, and it is possible that the eurozone\u2019s slowdown \u2013 especially Germany\u2019s \u2013 will prove temporary.\n\nMoreover, global financial conditions are easing as a result of the Fed and other central banks\u2019 renewed dovishness, and this could translate into stronger U.S. domestic growth. Much will depend on whether Trump abstains from launching a separate trade war against the European auto industry, which would rattle equity markets again.\n\nYet, barring more fights over the federal budget and the debt ceiling \u2013 not to mention possible impeachment proceedings against Trump \u2013 the U.S. could be spared serious domestic political and policy shocks in the months ahead.\n\nIf gross domestic product growth does remain resilient this year, some acceleration of wage growth and price inflation could follow, and core inflation may even rise above target in the second half of the year or 2020. And while the Fed seems willing to tolerate a period of temporary above-target inflation, it cannot allow that to become the new status quo.\n\nShould this scenario arise later in the year, or next year, the Fed could hike its baseline rate by another 25 basis points before settling into a protracted pause. Either way, the new normal will be a U.S. policy rate close to or just below 3%.",

Press reports are calling this a setback for the president. But the real story is that 41 of the Senate\u2019s 53 Republicans voted with Trump. That\u2019s enough to sustain the veto he has promised. So the wall will proceed, even though Americans and their elected representatives oppose it.\n\nMost Americans, in polls, have rejected Trump\u2019s wall. Four months ago, in an election that Trump framed as a referendum on border security, voters installed a Congress that opposed the wall. Congress, in turn, refused to give Trump the money he had demanded for the project.\n\nSo the president issued an emergency decree to proceed on his own. Most lawmakers have voted to block Trump\u2019s decree, but that\u2019s not enough. Because of the president\u2019s veto power, all he needs is one-third of either body to stand with him. And he has that. A president who lost the popular vote in 2016, backed by a party that lost the election of 2018, is acting against the will of the public. The threat to America isn\u2019t coming from beyond our borders. It\u2019s coming from within.\n\nMany senators who stood with Trump on Thursday argued that this isn\u2019t a constitutional crisis. They pointed out that Trump based his emergency decree on the 1976 National Emergencies Act, which affirms the president\u2019s authority to declare a crisis and thereby claim \u201cextraordinary\u201d powers. Since Congress itself passed this law, these senators reasoned, the law itself amounts to legislative consent. Trump made the same argument on Thursday morning. \u201cOur actions to address the National Emergency at the Southern Border,\u201d he tweeted, are \u201cEXPRESSLY authorized by Congress.\u201d\n\nGet The Angle in Your Inbox Every weekday, Slate's copy editors round up the stories you should read.

The Congress of 1976 couldn\u2019t have expressly authorized Trump\u2019s emergency, because in 1976, no such emergency had been declared. Trump is claiming his powers through creative interpretation. If you read the Emergencies Act, you\u2019ll see that it focuses on constraining executive powers, not extending them. The principal constraint written into the law is that if the president declares an emergency, Congress has to vote on whether to terminate the declaration. The law includes specific timetables to make sure Congress moves quickly.\n\nJust give us this one coup, says the authoritarian party, and we\u2019ll restore democracy.\n\nThe problem with the 1976 law is that it posited a basic level of integrity. It assumed that the president wouldn\u2019t use his emergency powers to appropriate money in defiance of the express will of Congress. It also assumed that if the president abused his authority, Congress would terminate the declaration. Those assumptions held true for four decades. But we now have a president willing to abuse his power, backed by a party willing to defend his abuses.\n\nThe senators who voted on Thursday to stand with Trump, based on the argument that Congress gave him the requisite authority in 1976, abdicated their responsibility under the law. The Congress of 1976 wrote into the Emergencies Act a mandate to future members of Congress. That mandate was to exercise independent judgment in assessing the president\u2019s declaration and in applying the intent of the act. The Republican senators of 2019 were entrusted by the Congress of 1976 with the duty to check executive power. And they shirked it.\n\nOn Thursday morning, hours before the Senate voted, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell offered his Republican colleagues a cynical excuse to support Trump\u2019s abuse. \u201cIf the 116th Congress regrets the degree of flexibility that the 94th Congress gave the executive, then the 116th Congress has the ability to do something about it,\u201d said McConnell. He proposed to revise the Emergencies Act through future legislation enacted under \u201cregular order.\u201d Trump made the same pitch, offering to update the Emergencies Act \u201cat a later date.\u201d In the meantime, Trump and McConnell urged Republican senators to give Trump enough votes to sustain his veto and preserve the current emergency declaration. And they succeeded.\n\nNo one should trust this offer. A president who seizes the power of the purse in defiance of the will of Congress, which no president has done before, can\u2019t be expected to accept real constraints. In fact, on Wednesday, Trump rejected a Republican proposal to limit his authority under the Emergencies Act. It\u2019s laughable that McConnell, while urging Congress to give the president immediate and unprecedented emergency powers, insists that constraints on these powers should be deferred to a more orderly legislative process. Just give us this one coup, says the authoritarian party, and we\u2019ll restore democracy.\n\nOne of the senators who voted with Trump on Thursday is Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina. Two weeks ago, in the Washington Post, Tillis wrote that he opposed Trump\u2019s declaration. \u201cI am a member of the Senate, and I have grave concerns when our institution looks the other way at the expense of weakening Congress\u2019s power,\u201d the senator explained. \u201cIt is my responsibility to be a steward of the Article I branch, to preserve the separation of powers.\u201d There was \u201cno intellectual honesty,\u201d Tillis observed, in Republicans defending \u201cexecutive overreach\u201d by Trump after opposing it under President Barack Obama.\n\nBut that\u2019s exactly what Tillis did on Thursday. In a grotesque obeisance on the Senate floor, he reversed himself and announced that he would vote with Trump. \u201cThe White House has been very gracious, and I should say very patient\u201d in tolerating Republican dissenters such as himself, Tillis told his colleagues. In fact, he added, the White House had magnanimously arranged for Trump to \u201cmake a statement that he\u2019s willing to work with us.\u201d Tillis concluded: \u201cThat this president is prepared to transfer power back to the Article I branch by his statement, either publicly or through his administration, is extraordinary.\u201d\n\nNo. What\u2019s extraordinary is a senator bowing and scraping over a president\u2019s hypothetical offer to \u201ctransfer power back\u201d to Congress. What\u2019s extraordinary is a bloc of senators colluding with a president to force through an expenditure that the American people and their representatives rejected. What\u2019s extraordinary is the Congress of 2019 betraying the Congress of 1976 and the Framers of the Constitution.\n\nThe election, by a non-plurality of voters, of a commander in chief with no respect for rules or precedents was just the first stage of our descent into autocracy. We\u2019re now in the second stage: consolidation of power behind the autocrat, secured by his abettors in Congress. There is indeed a national emergency. But the threat isn\u2019t coming from Mexico. It\u2019s coming from the Republican Party.",

    "title": "Why Did the Post-Shutdown Jobs Numbers Get Weird in February?",
    "description": "The U.S. economy added just 20,000 jobs last month -- far fewer than anyone expected.",
    "text": "The Labor Department's monthly jobs report is a closely watched measure of U.S. economic health, and for February, it came with a surprise plot twist: The results -- 20,000 jobs added -- were the worst in a year and half, and were wildly off the mark from the consensus forecast of 180,000. But was seasonality, weather, or President Trump's government shutdown to blame -- or is the data just incomplete?\n\nIn this segment from Motley Fool Money, host Chris Hill and senior analysts Andy Cross, Ron Gross, and Jason Moser discuss why they are more focused on other data points like the U6 unemployment rate, the three-month rolling average, and the areas where significant hiring did take place. They also talk about why there was such a wide difference between the private ADP jobs report and the federal government's results.\n\nA full transcript follows the video.\n\nThis video was recorded on March 8, 2019.\n\nChris Hill: The jobs report for February surprised a lot of people with just 20,000 new jobs added to the U.S. economy. The worst month for job creation in a year and a half. Ron, the consensus expectation was for 180,000 new jobs. How'd we miss by that much?\n\nRon Gross: The headline is very curious, and by curious, I mean confusing. Twenty thousand, much weaker than expected, so much you have to wonder if, potentially, maybe it's not even correct. There could be seasonality in there. There could be weather. There could be the government shutdown. It seems like something is wrong. It doesn't jive with the ADP report we got earlier in the week, which showed construction sector adding 25,000 jobs. This report today shows the construction sector losing 31,000 jobs. That's a 56,000-job swing. Somebody's wrong there. There's a lot of things going on.\n\nDon't forget, also, this number today, there's a margin of error plus or minus 100,000 jobs. That's a pretty big margin of error. I expect that we will see a pretty large revision once somebody figures out what's going on.\n\nThings to focus on, I think, are the all-encompassing view. Unemployment rate went down significantly to 7.3%, and, a nice wage increase.\n\nAndy Cross: Yeah. I think the overall way to think about this is, you have to remember to take these in three-month or even six-month average estimates. Last year, we were up 223,000 per month when you look at three-month rolling periods. I think it's important to not just take one number into play here.\n\nOne interesting point that I did like was, the professional and business services were up 42,000 for the month. That's basically in line with the average over the last year or so. Those tend to be high-paying, well-regarded roles that the U.S. is going to be more responsible for growing over the next decade or so. That one continues to be pretty impressive to me.\n\nGross: I was going to say, you shouldn't expect to see a robust job growth forever. Once we get closer to full employment, and there's less folks to get jobs out there, you'll see that number come down. I wouldn't be surprised to see that number slowly come down over time. This is just so severe that it makes me think something is a little wonky.\n\nHill: Safe to assume that we all expect there to be revisions upward when we get the numbers a month from now, but I want to go back to the construction number, Ron. That was the thing that leapt out to me in the initial report. I hadn't seen the ADP numbers earlier in the week. That's one of those things where, not to get greedy here, but not only do I want to see revisions up in a month's time, I want to see that construction number up. If this number is correct and the ADP number is the one that's wrong, that has broader implications for the economy.\n\nGross: For sure. You would much rather see a robust construction industry, for sure. Now, the ADP report and this report are often at odds with each other. They don't always go in lockstep. It's just not typically as severe of a difference as this.\n\nHill: I like that they have a margin of error of 100,000 jobs. Wouldn't that be nice?\n\nGross: I'm going to start doing that.\n\nHill: Whatever your job is in life, if you had a margin of error that big...",

    "description": "WASHINGTON, March 6 (Reuters) - - Slowing global growth and the 35-day partial federal government shutdown weighed on the U.S. economy in the first weeks of 2019, but it continued growing amid still tight labor markets, the Federal Reserve reported on Wednesd\u2026",
    "text": "FILE PHOTO: A closing sign is seen outside the National Gallery of Art in Washington, U.S., before it will be reopen after partial government shutdown, January 27, 2019. REUTERS/Yuri Gripas\n\nBy Howard Schneider\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Slowing global growth and the 35-day partial federal government shutdown weighed on the U.S. economy in the first weeks of 2019, but it continued growing amid still-tight labor markets, the Federal Reserve reported on Wednesday.\n\n\"Economic activity continued to expand in late January and February,\" even as concerns took root at the U.S. central bank about a possible slowdown, the Fed said in its regular \"Beige Book\" compendium of anecdotes compiled from industry and business contacts around the country.\n\nThe pace of growth was \"slight-to-moderate\" in 10 of the Fed's 12 districts, with those in Philadelphia and St. Louis reporting \"flat economic conditions.\"\n\nStill, the overall tenor of the Beige Book may relieve some of the concerns about growth in the real economy that prompted the Fed to pause its cycle of interest rate hikes in January after a sharp correction in financial markets and other risks began increasing late last year.\n\nTighter credit conditions were cited as damping consumer spending; concerns about tariffs continued to weigh on the minds of executives and crimp profits as input costs rose more than could be passed along to consumers; and the government shutdown \"led to slower economic activity in some sectors\" including manufacturing, retail and real estate, across roughly half of the Fed's districts.\n\nJob and wage gains, however, continued, with the St. Louis district reporting that opportunities for work were so plentiful that college enrollment was dropping \"as potential students were increasingly choosing to enter the labor market.\"\n\nIn the Philadelphia district, business contacts \"continued to note that the labor market was very tight ... Firms are responding by raising wages, increasing job flexibility, training new hires who have fewer skills than desired, and making greater use of trial periods of temp agency placements.\"\n\nThe Fed's policy-setting committee is scheduled to meet in two weeks to make its latest interest rate decision, and is widely expected to leave borrowing costs unchanged, consistent with the \"patient\" strategy it outlined in January.\n\n\n\n\n\nPRICE PRESSURES\n\nInflation will be a key element of any decision about when or if to raise rates again, and the Beige Book reported that prices increased at only a \"modest-to-moderate pace\" in the period.\n\nBut it also hinted at price pressures building in parts of the economy. The Fed's Cleveland district, for example, outlined an economy where price hikes were being passed among firms, with some feeling they were able to pass them along to consumers, and others not.\n\n\"Construction companies passed on strong input cost increases. By contrast, manufacturers' prices remained more stable ... Transportation companies raised prices, but retailers did not raise prices to cover transportation cost increases,\" the Fed reported.\n\nAlthough much about the U.S. economic outlook remained positive, businesses cited continued concern about trade and tariffs and the health of the global economy in general.\n\nManufacturers in particular \"conveyed concerns about weakening global demand, higher costs due to tariffs, and ongoing trade policy uncertainty.\" In some areas, including the Philadelphia district, that caused regional growth to grind to a halt.\n\nThe economy in that area was reported slowing from \"modest growth in the prior period to little or no change in the current period,\" the Fed said.\n\nWhile the impact of the government shutdown is expected to be small on a nationwide basis, it was noticeable in some parts of the country.\n\nThe Richmond Fed, whose area includes Washington, said \"a sharp decline in tourism was reported by several firms in and around the District of Columbia.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Howard Schneider; Editing by Paul Simao)",
