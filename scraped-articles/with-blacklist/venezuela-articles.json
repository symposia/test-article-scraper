    "text": "'New York Times' Journalist Describes An 'Almost Unimaginable' Crisis In Venezuela\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Ariana Cubillos/AP Ariana Cubillos/AP\n\nVenezuelans have been suffering one calamity after the next, but in recent weeks, much of Venezuela has had to go long stretches without electricity.\n\nNew York Times journalist Nicholas Casey was in Maracaibo, Venezuela, in March when the country was hit by a six-day blackout, considered at the time the worst in Venezuela's history. He says people initially assumed that the outage had been planned and that power would be restored after a few hours. But as hours stretched into days, the country fell into chaos.\n\n\"By the fourth day of the power outage, that was when you started to hear shots getting fired in the street,\" Casey says. \"People were beginning to loot, and the store owners were coming out to defend their stores.\"\n\nAs Andes bureau chief for the Times, Casey has been covering the deepening economic and political chaos in Venezuela. He says the current crisis in the country is \"almost unimaginable.\"\n\n\"This is an oil-producing country. This was one of the most wealthy countries in Latin America,\" he says. \"And now this is a place where there are shortages of food, shortages of medicine. People's daily lives are spent trying to figure out how they're going to get basic things like eggs or coffee.\"\n\nCasey notes that Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who took over after the 2013 death of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, has become increasingly authoritarian, imprisoning political rivals and cracking down on protesters. Maduro has also cut off access for journalists, including Casey.\n\n\"The government doesn't allow me to live in Venezuela anymore. I lived there in 2016, and by the end of the year, my visa was revoked,\" Casey says. \"Their reaction to the stories that I've had \u2014 it's been terrible sometimes. Anything that they see that doesn't line up with their view of what's happening in the country they consider to be a lie.\"\n\nInterview highlights\n\nOn Venezuelans leaving their country because of the chaos\n\nThe U.N. estimates that it's upwards of 3 million people who have left. Now remember, this is a country of 30 million people. So we're talking about 10 percent of the population that has gone. And you see this when you walk around the streets of Caracas, which I have, or Maracaibo, which I did just a few weeks ago. There are areas which are completely empty. You walk down streets and you see that there's two or three people in one house, and then another house is gone, or another house has got a family of what looked like squatters, because they've just moved into the place.\n\nOn what the journey to leave Venezuela is like\n\nSo when you decide to leave, you usually say goodbye to your family, but there's no way of getting a flight, because you can't afford that. So for the most part, people take a bus using the bol\u00edvar, the currency that they have. Now the bol\u00edvars are worth money in Venezuela, but once you cross the border, they are almost worth nothing. So you're essentially bankrupt the moment that you cross into Colombia. ...\n\nAnd at that point you have to figure out how you're going to get somewhere. And that usually means you're going to walk, and often Venezuelans will spend a few days on the border, but then they keep moving, because there are so many Venezuelans in these border towns. There's no jobs for them there, so people set off on foot. They have usually a suitcase, backpacks, but they're trying to travel very light, because they know that they're going to have to carry everything on their backs that they're bringing, and hitching rides occasionally. Sometimes they can save a little bit of money to take a bus ride a short distance, but basically they are trying to put as many footsteps between them and Venezuela as they can. And it can be an extremely long process to try to travel these countries; these are very mountainous countries on foot.\n\nOn how neighboring countries are responding to the millions of migrants\n\nOn one end, these countries are trying to pressure [President] Maduro now to step down, because they know that this migrant crisis is going to get even worse the more politically unstable the country gets. Countries like Colombia understand that Venezuela used to be a country that took their immigrants, especially during the darkest days of the paramilitaries and the guerrilla fighting, but at the same time, they understand they can't take every Venezuelan that comes.\n\nAnd not only that, because of this crisis that's getting worse and worse, because of lack of medicine mainly, people are coming into these countries with diseases that should be controlled in Venezuela \u2014 diseases like diphtheria, malaria, tuberculosis have made a huge comeback in Venezuela. So if you're a neighboring country like Brazil or Colombia or a country like Ecuador or Peru, who are farther away but are also taking immigrants, this is a very scary situation that's right on your doorstep.\n\nOn how President Maduro forced visiting Cuban doctors to use access to medicine as a way to gain votes for Maduro right before an election\n\nThey would start by going house to house to people. ... The way that it was being described to me was that essentially you would start by handing people medications that they needed, especially seeing if they had chronic illnesses that they really needed medication for on a regular basis. And then after you start to get their trust, you would start to bring up Maduro. You'd start to bring up politics. You'd ask them, \"Are you registered to vote?\" And then actually start to make a much harder pitch, like \"You need to vote for Maduro. This is where this medicine is coming from,\" and ultimately at the end of this there would be a threat, which is that \"If you don't vote for Maduro, there is a possibility that you will lose your medication. You will lose your free health care.\" And this is what all of the doctors that I talked to said. ...\n\nThe further along that you got, the less popular that Maduro was becoming, the more that you began to see that he was leaning on this medical system to try to drive votes.\n\nThe further along that you got, the less popular that Maduro was becoming, the more that you began to see that he was leaning on this medical system to try to drive votes. In one election in 2015, there was a doctor who said that when it appeared that the opposition was ahead in a legislative vote, that they actually not only saw the doctors out that afternoon to try to get people to go vote, [but] they also dressed other people up, who were not doctors, as doctors and gave them medicine to go get people to vote, to try to get them to trust these doctors to go and vote.\n\nIn the last elections that were taking place in 2017 and 2018, there was a doctor who was explaining to me about how he was in a small town and wasn't able to give medication to certain patients that were from the opposition and also was told to withhold things like oxygen tanks and not put them out early in the year because they wanted to bring out all the medicine and the oxygen tanks, which were largely in shortage, just before the election, just before people were going to vote, essentially to give the impression that Maduro had solved this medical crisis before people had to go vote for him again.\n\nOne reason to be optimistic that Venezuela will recover\n\nI think there's a way out, and Venezuela, we have to remember, has lots of oil. So no matter how bad the economic crisis is, if there is a way out of the political crisis, there is a way for the country to be able to produce the money that it needs to be able to get back on its feet again. Unlike many other countries in the world, it's extremely blessed to have this natural resource there. But the way out is to have an election. People need to be able to choose who their leader is, because until that can happen, whoever is in charge \u2014 whether it's Juan Guaid\u00f3 saying that he is the president or Nicol\u00e1s Maduro saying that he is the president \u2014 isn't going to have the legitimacy to do anything about it.\n\nVenezuelans ultimately need to be able to choose who's going to be their leader, and they might choose someone again from the left. After all these years, I'm not sure that that's what they're going to do, but they need to be able to have a choice between a number of parties from the opposition and whoever Maduro would put as his candidate, and whoever wins can then take the next steps.\n\nNow, it's not going to be a fast process. This is something that's going to take years, to rebuild this country. But it's not necessarily the level I think always of devastation that makes people feel the worst. It's the fact that things are getting worse every day. Even if things were at a low point in Venezuela, if people could see that there was a reason for hope that things were starting to get better, I think you would start to see people coming back to Venezuela.\n\nAmy Salit and Mooj Zadie produced and edited the audio of this interview.

    "text": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Much of the country, including Caracas, was plunged into darkness\n\nSchools and workplaces in Venezuela have closed as an electricity blackout continues into a second day.\n\nThe power cuts, which started on Thursday afternoon, have been caused by issues at a major hydroelectric plant.\n\nThe government of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro has blamed the opposition, accusing them of sabotage.\n\nIt comes amid rising tensions over opposition efforts - backed by the US and some Latin American countries - to remove Mr Maduro from power.\n\nCommuters in Caracas were plunged into almost complete darkness during rush hour on Thursday before the blackout extended to other areas.\n\nThe lack of electricity has caused flights to be diverted from the main airport in Caracas, from where thousands of workers were forced to walk home.\n\nThe problems stem from the Guri dam plant and have affected the telephone network and metro in Caracas.\n\nState television on Friday said power had been restored in some parts of the capital.\n\nHowever, local media reports say 15 of the country's 23 states have been affected by the blackouts, as well as Caracas.\n\nVenezuela depends on its vast hydroelectric infrastructure, rather than its oil reserves, for its domestic electricity supply. But decades of underinvestment has damaged the major dams, and sporadic blackouts are commonplace.\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption People walked home after workplaces and schools closed\n\nImage copyright EPA Image caption People in Caracas queued up outside banks as the power cut continued\n\nMr Maduro has accused opposition leader and self-declared interim president Juan Guaid\u00f3 of trying to mount a coup with the help of \"US imperialists\".\n\nMr Guaid\u00f3 said on Twitter that the blackout was a matter of \"chaos, concern and anger\" and \"evidence of the usurper's inefficiency\", adding that \"light would return\" once Mr Maduro was removed from power.\n\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also weighed in, blaming the \"Maduro regime's incompetence\".\n\n\"No food. No medicine. Now, no power. Next, no Maduro,\" he tweeted.\n\nBlame game\n\nBy Will Grant, BBC News, Caracas\n\nIn a country where food is scarce and prices exorbitantly high for many ordinary people, there is currently a lot of food rotting and going to waste in switched-off fridges.\n\nVenezuela has seen blackouts before, often. But few last as long or are as widespread as this one. The country's politicians - from President Nicolas Maduro to opposition leader, Juan Guaido - are blaming each other via Twitter.\n\nThe sense of confusion has only added to the growing stress for Venezuelans over the conflict in their country.\n\nWhy do blackouts happen in Venezuela?\n\nBlackouts are nothing new in Venezuela. Critics say they have been getting worse since the nationalisation of the power grid in 2007. In 2016, the problem reached such a critical level that the government declared a 60-day nationwide state of emergency.\n\nIn an attempt to stem the country's chronic power shortages, the government has periodically enforced controlled blackouts, where they would switch the power off for up to six hours at a time.\n\nCritics say that far from helping, this has caused perishable food to go bad and crime to run rampant. And when unplanned blackouts - such as the latest one - have happened, officials have blamed a number of different outside forces.\n\nLast October, Electricity Minister Luis Motta Dominguez posted on Instagram that outages were caused by \"animals such as rats, mice, snakes, cats, squirrels\" getting into the hydroelectric system's substations - before adding that \"of course iguanas are included\".\n\nA few months earlier another senior official, Lisandro Cabello, said the power cuts were caused by the country's position near the Equator. He said the fact that \"we are very close to the Sun\" means more intensive use of power in Venezuela than in other countries.\n\nWhat's the background to the political crisis?\n\nMr Maduro took over the presidency when his late mentor Hugo Chavez died in 2013. In recent years Venezuela has experienced an economic collapse, with severe food shortages and inflation reaching at least 800,000% last year.\n\nThe Maduro government is becoming increasingly isolated as more and more countries blame it for the economic crisis, which has prompted more than three million people to leave Venezuela.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Juan Guaid\u00f3 was greeted by thousands of supporters on his return on Monday\n\nMr Guaid\u00f3, who leads the opposition-controlled National Assembly, declared himself interim president on 23 January and has been at loggerheads with President Maduro ever since.\n\nHe has been recognised as interim president by more than 50 countries but Mr Maduro retains the support of his close allies Russia, Cuba and China, among others.",

    "text": "Argentina's Lionel Messi returned to international duty for the first time since the World Cup on Friday but it was a disappointing night for the forward as his side lost 3-1 to Venezuela in a friendly in Madrid.\n\nMessi showed flashes of brilliance but it was not his night as Venezuela put three past their more illustrious rivals for the first time with goals from Salomon Rondon, Jhon Murillo and Josef Martinez. Lautaro Martinez scored Argentina's consolation.\n\nThe team announced after the loss that Messi will miss Tuesday's match against Morocco as a precaution following a groin injury. Atlanta United's Gonzalo \"Pity\" Martinez will also skip the match in Tangier with a hamstring injury.\n\nFollowing the match, Argentina manager Luis Scaloni said: \"The second half left us with positive things and the first half with negative ones. Better that they happened that way.\n\n\"We learned a lot from this loss. The situations we created were largely in due part to Messi. This match helped us to see how [the others] played alongside Messi.\"\n\nMessi took a sabbatical after his country's early departure from last year's finals in Russia, but he returned with a clean shaven new look to captain the side in the all-South American affair at Atletico Madrid's Wanda Metropolitano stadium.\n\nVenezuela had only beaten Argentina once in 23 previous encounters, but they got the perfect start after five minutes when Rondon brought down a long pass inside the box and crashed a shot past keeper Franco Armani.\n\nRondon should have made it two with a header in the 40th but the second goal was only moments away as Murillo took advantage of a quick free kick to scamper to the edge of the box and curl a lovely right-foot shot into the far corner of the net.\n\nLautaro Martinez finished off a superb counter-attack to pull Argentina back into the game after 59 minutes but their hopes were short lived and Venezuela's Josef Martinez made it 3-1 from the penalty spot with a quarter of an hour remaining.\n\n\"In the first half we created chances but they scored twice when we made mistakes,\" said Lautaro Martinez. \"In the second half we did well and moved the ball about but they got that penalty. We need to keep improving.\"\n\nAnd striker Dario Benedetto added: \"Messi is the best player in the world and we have to adapt ourselves to fastest way possible to him.\"\n\nAfter the match, Venezuela boss Rafael Dudamel said he would give up the post due to political situation that surrounds the team.\n\nThe country has been embroiled in an ongoing political and constitutional crisis with more than 50 countries denouncing leader Nicolas Maduro in recognizing Juan Guaido as the interim leader.\n\nA representative of Guaido posted a photo of a meeting with the team prior to the match and Dudamel said: \"I have spoken with the vice president and I have put my job at the disposition of the directors because all this time we are navigating very turbulent waters. Everything has been politicized and I am the coach for the whole country.\"\n\nDudamel added he would continue as coach for Venezuela's next match on Monday against Catalonia.\n\nInformation from Reuters was used in this story.",

    "description": "The U.S. announced it was withdrawing all of its embassy staff from Venezuela amid the ongoing political and economic crisis, although Maduro says he is kicking them out.",
    "text": "The U.S. is withdrawing its remaining diplomatic personnel from the embassy in Venezuela, citing the \"deteriorating situation\" given days of blackouts, increased water shortages and the threat of further protests.\n\nThe decision also comes amid growing concern that American diplomats could become a pawn in the battle with President Nicolas Maduro as the U.S. tries to push him from power.\n\nDespite Maduro's calls for their expulsion, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo vowed to keep American personnel there to support Juan Guaido, the president of the National Assembly who has been recognized as the country's interim president by the U.S. and over 50 other countries.\n\nBut the sudden reversal was announced late Monday night in a statement where Pompeo called embassy staff's presence a \"constraint on U.S. policy.\"\n\n(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Secretary of State Mike Pompeo holds a news conference to talk about the dire economic and political situation in Venezuela at the State Department headquarters, March 11, 2019, in Washington, DC.\n\n\"Decisions you make are always encumbered by the fact that you know there's real risk to your own people, people that you've sent into harm's way,\" Pompeo added Tuesday. \"We wanted to get them out of the country so that we could move forward in a way that provided that opportunity.\"\n\nU.S. Special Envoy for Venezuela Elliott Abrams wouldn't say what had been constrained, but that diplomats' presence weighed on senior officials in Washington because the U.S. does not believe Maduro's government had the ability to protect them.\n\nSince recognizing Guaido, the U.S. has sanctioned the state-owned oil company and top Maduro-aligned officials, imposed visa bans or revocations on over 250 officials and amassed around 200 metric tons of humanitarian aid across the border in Colombia and supported efforts by Guaido and his supporters to rush it across the border.\n\nBut nearly two months after casting Maduro as no longer legitimate, the socialist leader remains in control, backed by allies Cuba and Russia. Top Trump officials have warned in recent days that they want to take action to accelerate Maduro's departure, with Abrams saying Tuesday that there will be a \"significant number of additional visa revocations\" and \"some very significant additional sanctions\" imminently.\n\nThat could have exposed U.S. diplomats to retaliatory action by Maduro's government, especially as it grows more desperate amid the declining humanitarian situation.\n\n\"In every decision we made ... the safety of that staff was a key consideration, and that was something that weighed very heavily on our mind,\" Abrams told reporters Tuesday.\n\nThe embassy's facilities were also facing \"a finite number of days\" because of fuel shortages, a lack of water access, and little to no electricity and, therefore, telecommunications, Abrams said.\n\nVenezuela has been left in darkness, for five days now, with power outages across the country that have been blamed for deaths at hospitals and water and food shortages. Maduro's government has accused the U.S. of being behind the blackouts, which Pompeo denied Monday, calling them \"a direct result of years and years of neglect to the Venezuelan energy system.\"\n\nMaduro's Foreign Minister Jorge Arreaza said Tuesday that they were behind the departure of remaining U.S. diplomats, ordering them to leave after talks over their continued presence broke down Monday.\n\nAbrams confirmed that there had been talks with the Maduro government about U.S. diplomats, but because the U.S. viewed him as the \"former\" president of the country, his government had no right to expel Americans, who remained at the request of Guaido. While the U.S. remains confident in Guaido and his fledgling government, Abrams added, \"The fact is that today, the regime has the guns.\"\n\n(Fernando Llano/AP) People wait in line to fill up containers with water from a public fountain in Caracas, Venezuela, March 12, 2019.\n\nThe embassy had previously ordered the departure of non-emergency personnel and families in late January, slimming a staff of 100 to 150 personnel down to just a handful, led by Charg\u00e9 d' Affaires Jimmy Story. U.S. personnel will depart over the next couple of days, although the State Department has declined to say when that process will begin or end.\n\nThat means no U.S. government services for the remaining American citizens, who at one time numbered between 30,000 and 40,000, according to Special Representative for Venezuela Elliott Abrams. That number has likely decreased as the economic crisis has deepened in recent weeks, a State Department official told ABC News.\n\nThe State Department lists Venezuela as a \"Level 4: Do Not Travel\" on its advisory, urging American citizens to evacuate. The U.S. is in talks with a handful of countries to designate a protecting power -- a third-party nation that looks after U.S. citizens in a foreign country, like Sweden does in North Korea.\n\nBut even before a protecting power has been designated, the U.S. will not provide evacuations for U.S. citizens, urging them instead to leave as soon as possible on commercial travel.",

    "text": "WASHINGTON/CARACAS (Reuters) - The United States imposed sanctions on Friday on Venezuela\u2019s development bank, Bandes, a day after the Trump administration warned there would be consequences for the arrest by Venezuelan authorities of opposition leader Juan Guaido\u2019s top aide.\n\nA man stands outside the Bandes bank headquarters in Caracas, Venezuela March 22, 2019. REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins\n\nThe U.S. Treasury said it was slapping the sanctions on Banco de Desarrollo Economico y Social de Venezuela, including its subsidiaries in Uruguay and Bolivia. It also imposed sanctions on state-owned Venezuelan commercial banks, including Banco de Venezuela and Banco Bicentenario.\n\nIn a statement, Venezuela\u2019s foreign ministry said it \u201cenergetically rejects the unilateral, coercive, arbitrary and illegal measures\u201d taken by the Trump administration. It said the sanctions would affect millions of Venezuelan people and companies who use the banks.\n\nCongress head Guaido, who invoked the constitution to assume the interim presidency in January, has accused Bandes of being used by President Nicolas Maduro\u2019s government to funnel money outside Venezuela.\n\nThe White House said in a statement it was committed to preventing Maduro\u2019s government from stealing Venezuela\u2019s resources and from arresting those pushing for political change.\n\nGuaido\u2019s chief of staff, Roberto Marrero, was detained in a pre-dawn raid on Thursday, sparking vows of reprisals from the United States, which along with most Western countries backs Guaido as Venezuela\u2019s rightful leader.\n\n\u201cThe United States will not tolerate the arrest of peaceful democratic actors, including members of the democratically-elected Venezuelan National Assembly and those Venezuelans working with interim President Juan Guaido,\u201d the White House said in a statement.\n\nIn a tweet on Friday evening, Guaido said he had been informed that Marrero was being transported from jail to court. He demanded Marrero be freed, calling the judges who would hear his case \u201ccomplicit with the dictatorship.\u201d\n\nVenezuelan authorities said on Thursday that an arms cache had been seized from Marrero\u2019s house and accused him of planning attacks against political figures. Guaido said guns had been planted by intelligence agents.\n\nDEBT WITH CHINA\n\nThe U.S. Treasury said Maduro tried to move $1 billion out of Venezuela through Banco Bandes Uruguay in early 2019 as he came under increasing pressure from the United States and other countries in the region to step down.\n\nBandes has received billions of dollars over the past decade from the China Development Bank, in exchange for oil, which the Venezuelan government used to fund infrastructure projects.\n\nUruguay has stayed neutral on Venezuela\u2019s political crisis and has called for dialogue, while China, Russia and regional ally Cuba have backed Maduro.\n\nBut the sanctions on Bandes could test Beijing\u2019s ties with Caracas, since it would impede Venezuela from restructuring its $20 billion debt with China, opposition lawmaker Angel Alvarado said on Friday.\n\n\u201cThat makes it even less likely that China will step in to save Maduro,\u201d Alvarado wrote on Twitter. Guaido and his allies have repeatedly argued that China and Russia are more likely to collect on their loans to Venezuela with Maduro out of office.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nThe sanctions freeze assets belonging to the banks and subsidiaries, and prevent U.S. citizens from any dealings with them. They follow a raft of other sanctions imposed by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump in recent months against Maduro, top government officials, and state oil firm PDVSA.\n\nTrump\u2019s national security adviser John Bolton tweeted earlier on Friday: \u201cBANDES bank is to Venezuela\u2019s financial sector what PDVSA is to its oil sector. This action will severely affect any attempted currency movements by Maduro and his cronies moving forward. Do not test the resolve of this Administration.\u201d\n\nIt said that Visa, Mastercard and American Express would be prohibited from facilitating transactions involving the blacklisted commercial banks, beginning in March 2020. That would complicate basic purchases in a country stricken by hyperinflation and a sixth year of economic contraction.",

(Photo: Fernando Llano, AP)\n\n\u201cThe situation in Venezuela has gotten considerably worse in the last week,\u201d said Brett Bruen, a former foreign service officer stationed in Venezuela and a global engagement adviser in the Obama administration. \u201cIt\u2019s gone from alarming to catastrophic, so that requires a reassessment of what our policy is.\u201d\n\nThursday marked the seventh day of Venezuela\u2019s mass power outage \u2013 which has exacerbated the crisis for Venezuelans coping with food and medicine shortages. Without power, hospitals have been unable to help the sick and dying, water pumps have stopped working, and vandals have ransacked stores and other businesses, according to media reports.\n\nChina offered to come to the rescue of Maduro's socialist government, which has been unable to fix the power grid and is increasingly isolated internationally.\n\n\u201cChina is deeply concerned about this,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said in Beijing on Wednesday. \u201cChina is willing to provide help and technical support to restore Venezuela\u2019s power grid.\u201d\n\nCiting the dire conditions, the State Department withdrew all its American Embassy staff from Venezuela this week. American officials expressed alarm at Maduro\u2019s call Monday for armed gangs, known as \u201ccolectivos,\u201d to rise up and fight the political opposition. The Trump administration has recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as the legitimate president of Venezuela and labeled Maduro a corrupt usurper.\n\n\u201cI call on the colectivos,\u201d Maduro declared, according to The Washington Post. \u201cThe hour of resistance has arrived.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s calling for armed gangs to take over the streets, and it is obviously going to be a great worry to Venezuelans,\u201d Elliott Abrams, the Trump administration\u2019s special envoy for Venezuela, said during a State Department briefing Tuesday. \u201cPerhaps it is a sign of Maduro\u2019s lack of confidence in his own security forces. But it is by definition a breakdown of law and order.\u201d\n\nAbrams and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo suggested this week that the Trump administration was preparing to increase pressure on Maduro. In his announcement that all American diplomats would leave Venezuela, Pompeo said their presence on the ground was a \u201cconstraint on U.S. policy.\u201d The secretary of state did not elaborate, but the remark fueled speculation of military intervention.\n\nAbrams said the administration would impose \u201csignificant\u201d new sanctions on Venezuela in the coming days. He declined to say whether the Trump administration asked the Pentagon to draft military options.\n\nMichael Dobson, a former senior sanctions policy adviser at the U.S. Treasury Department, said the United States is running out of economic tools to squeeze Maduro. The administration has slapped sanctions on the country\u2019s oil sector, which is by far its largest source of revenue. Dobson said the Treasury Department could look at restrictions on Venezuela\u2019s gold industry and some other minerals.\n\n\u201cBut beyond that, there isn\u2019t much left,\u201d said Dobson, an attorney in Washington. \u201cSo it\u2019s largely a waiting game to see, will the military recalculate and see that it\u2019s no longer worth having Maduro in the chair?\u201d\n\nDemocrats fear the Trump administration isn\u2019t interested in waiting. Wednesday, the House Foreign Affairs Committee heard testimony about the implications of U.S. military intervention in Venezuela.\n\n\u201cMilitary intervention would be much more difficult than many believe,\u201d Rebecca Bill Chavez, a former deputy assistant defense secretary for the Western Hemisphere, told the committee.\n\nDemocrats warned against any military action without congressional authorization.\n\n\u201cWe all agree the Maduro regime has destroyed Venezuela\u2019s economy, starved its people and engaged in widespread corruption and repression,\u201d said Rep. David Cicilline, D-R.I., the lead sponsor of legislation that would bar the administration from spending any money on military action in Venezuela.\n\n\u201cNot only would military intervention be illegal, it would also come with serious consequences that I fear would not only hurt the Venezuelan people, but also the prospects for democracy,\u201d he said.\n\nMore: Americans should consider fleeing Venezuela as new sanctions loom, State Department says\n\nMore: John Bolton's notes on '5,000 troops to Colombia' spark speculation about military intervention in Venezuela\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/03/14/venezuela-crisis-power-failure-blackout-maduro-guaido-trump-military/3161336002/",

The collapse of the power grid is yet another setback for a country, whose rich oil reserves made it one of Latin America\u2019s affluent decades ago. Meanwhile, President Nicolas Maduro blamed \u201cterrorists\u201d for a near-nationwide blackout that gripped Venezuela, a few weeks after a similar outage caused several chaos and deaths. In a statement on Twitter, Maduro said a deliberately set \u201clarge-scale fire\u201d hit facilities around the Guri hydroelectric plant, which supplies power to 80 percent of Venezuela\u2019s 30 million inhabitants. Communication minister Jorge Rodriguez also tweeted images of electrical installations consumed by flames. Public transport and water supplies were hugely affected. Junior Veliz, an unemployed man standing outside a Caracas hospital, told AFP that his newborn daughter \u201cdied because (the hospital) didn\u2019t have heating at the time the power went out -- she died of respiratory arrest when the power went out.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a real catastrophe, a humanitarian crisis,\u201d said Noe de Souza. \u201cVenezuela doesn\u2019t stand a chance anymore, there is no life here,\u201d said Johnny Vargas, a restaurant worker, who wished to leave the country. \u201cPeople can\u2019t work anymore; we can\u2019t do anything,\u201d he added.

    "description": "At the end of 2015, managers at Rosneft, the Russian state-controlled oil firm, sounded the alarm to their bosses about the company's investments in Venezuela. Rosneft's local partner, Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA, owed it hundreds of millions of dollar\u2026",
    "text": "MOSCOW (Reuters) - At the end of 2015, managers at Rosneft, the Russian state-controlled oil firm, sounded the alarm to their bosses about the company\u2019s investments in Venezuela. Rosneft\u2019s local partner, Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA, owed it hundreds of millions of dollars, according to internal documents, and there seemed no prospect things would get better.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A general view shows oil treatment facilities at Vankorskoye oil field owned by Rosneft north of Krasnoyarsk, Russia, March 25, 2015. REUTERS/Sergei Karpukhin/File Photo\n\n\u201cIt will be like this for eternity,\u201d a Rosneft internal auditor wrote in an email to a colleague in November 2015, complaining there was no progress in getting PDVSA to explain a $700 million hole in the balance sheet of a joint venture.\n\nThe email was among scores of internal Rosneft communications - including presentations, copies of official letters, memos and spreadsheets \u2013 reviewed by Reuters. They cover the firm\u2019s operations in Venezuela between 2012 and 2015.\n\nIt was a period when other international oil companies had either quit the country or were freezing new onshore investments, worried about the policies of the populist socialist administration. But Rosneft, majority owned by the Russian state, doubled down, increasing its stakes in joint ventures with PDVSA and lending more, the documents show. Rosneft was standing by its Venezuelan partner just as the Kremlin was supporting leader Hugo Chavez and his successor as president, Nicolas Maduro.\n\nRosneft has poured around $9 billion into Venezuelan projects since 2010 but has yet to break even, Reuters has calculated, based on Rosneft\u2019s annual reports, its public disclosures and the internal documents.\n\nThe Rosneft documents also reveal:\n\n- The Russians believed they were owed hundreds of millions of dollars from their joint ventures with PDVSA.\n\n- Oil output at the joint ventures was far lower than projected.\n\n- The joint ventures struggled to get hold of basic drilling equipment.\n\n- The Russians believed PDVSA spent millions of dollars from one joint venture on \u201csocial projects\u201d in a remote area where just a few hundred people lived.\n\n- Managers brought the problems to the attention of Rosneft\u2019s chief executive, Igor Sechin, who ordered measures to right the ship.\n\nSince late 2015, the end of the period covered by the documents, some of Rosneft\u2019s problems have eased because it has taken greater shareholder and operational control of its interests. But it remains deeply invested in a company and a country that are in crisis.\n\nThe reason Rosneft kept doubling down on its bet was political, according to two people close to the firm and two others with links to the Venezuela projects. State-owned Rosneft was expected to help prop up Moscow\u2019s allies in Caracas, these sources said.\n\n\u201cFrom the very beginning it was a purely political project. We all had to contribute,\u201d said an executive at a Russian oil firm that partnered with Rosneft in Venezuela.\n\nThe Russian who oversees this strategic business relationship is one of President Vladimir Putin\u2019s closest lieutenants: Rosneft Chief Executive Igor Sechin. The two men have known each other since at least the early 1990s when they worked in the mayor\u2019s office of their native St Petersburg. When Putin went to Moscow to become a mid-ranking official in the presidential administration, Sechin went with him.\n\n\u201cI liked him,\u201d Putin told authors of a book about his life. \u201cWhen I moved to Moscow, Sechin asked to come with me. I took him.\u201d\n\nA bust of Hugo Chavez greets visitors to Rosneft\u2019s offices in Caracas. Sechin often asks to see messages to Maduro before they are sent and adds the phrase: \u201cViva la Revolucion!\u201d a former Rosneft employee said.\n\nRussia views its relationship with Caracas as a way to project power into Washington\u2019s backyard, according to Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at Carnegie Moscow Center, a think tank. Venezuela is a big buyer of Russian weapons. The billions of dollars that Rosneft has invested in Venezuela are an added incentive for Moscow to keep standing by its old ally.\n\nThe story of Rosneft\u2019s troubled partnership comes at a time of deepening crisis inside Venezuela\u2019s giant oil company. The country\u2019s fortunes are closely tied to those of PDVSA, which accounts for 90 percent of the nation\u2019s export revenues. The Rosneft documents provide fresh evidence of long-term mismanagement at PDVSA, helping explain an economic collapse that has left millions struggling to eat.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on March 11 Rosneft continued to buy crude oil from Venezuela and to \u201cthrow a lifeline to the regime.\u201d But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Rosneft was driven by the interests of its shareholders. He denied the Kremlin applied pressure on the firm to invest in Venezuela.\n\n\u201cFirst and foremost, Rosneft works as a commercial company in all corners of the world, and it works seeking commercial profit. Therefore this is what they do in Venezuela,\u201d Peskov said in reply to questions from Reuters. \u201cNaturally such major projects are planned for the long term. As for assessments of the profitability of the projects, that\u2019s for the company itself, it\u2019s not a question for us.\u201d\n\nNeither Rosneft nor PDVSA responded to requests for comment for this article.\n\nMISSING PARTS AND MISSED DEADLINES\n\nIn September 2012, at a drilling site in the Orinoco basin, Rosneft\u2019s Sechin filled a jar with crude oil and lifted it into the air to mark the moment his firm joined the ranks of global oil majors. Rosneft was part of a Russian consortium that had acquired a 40 percent share in Venezuela\u2019s Junin-6 oilfield. PDVSA held the other 60 percent.\n\nRosneft already pumped oil from its home fields in Siberia; now it had an overseas presence too, tapping into some of the world\u2019s biggest crude oil reserves on the banks of the Orinoco River. \u201cToday is indeed an historic day,\u201d Sechin told Russian state television at the ceremony to mark the start of production. \u201cRussian companies have now proved their right to be among the leaders of the global oil sector.\u201d\n\nYet soon after Sechin spoke, Rosneft\u2019s foray into the Orinoco basin was running into problems, the documents reviewed by Reuters show.\n\nRelated Coverage Billions spent, little to show\n\nIn November 2012, without asking its Russian partners, PDVSA shut down one of the four drilling rigs at Junin-6 and removed it, a report by the Russian consortium found that year. Local people staged protests that further blocked work. By the end of 2012, just six wells had been drilled, far short of the project\u2019s target of 47.\n\nSpare parts for drilling at Junin-6 were procured from a PDVSA unit called Bariven; but getting equipment from Bariven took 10 to 18 months, according to the documents. Drilling rigs were not operating 37 percent of the time. It took on average 49 days to drill a single well, instead of the anticipated 22 days. PDVSA did not respond to questions about the delays.\n\nJunin-6 production forecasts were cut. Rosneft had said in September 2012 that the field would deliver 20,000 barrels per day by the end of the year. In fact, over the whole of 2012 it yielded only 21,400 barrels.\n\nThree years on, there was little sign of improvement. A Rosneft report covering the first three quarters of 2015 cited well construction \u201cof an unsatisfactory quality\u201d and \u201cnon-optimal trajectories\u201d of wells.\n\nBy the end of 2015, the forecast for peak oil output from Junin-6 had been slashed from 450,000 barrels per day to 250,000 barrels per day. Rosneft\u2019s flagship project had lost its luster.\n\nProblems remain across the Orinoco Basin, according to union leaders who spoke to Reuters. They said that in fields east of Junin, only a handful of the dozens of drilling rigs are working at any one time. Workers complain they don\u2019t have basic equipment such as boots, gloves and helmets. The situation in PDVSA offices is no better. Paper is in short supply. In a vain effort to stem a worker exodus, some HR departments display \u201cNo resignation\u201d signs.\n\nNor is life in Venezuela easy for Rosneft staff. There is often no mains water in the high-end Caracas district where they live, said a Russian who knows families there. A couple of times a week, a water tanker arrives and fills up containers in each apartment.\n\nTwo of Rosneft\u2019s Russian partners in Junin-6 dropped out. The smaller Surgutneftegaz decided to quit the project in November 2012. In December 2014, Russia\u2019s second biggest oil firm, Lukoil, announced it too was dropping out. \u201cLooking back, a lot of people at Lukoil breathed a sigh of relief that they didn\u2019t have to pile billions into Venezuela,\u201d said an executive in the Junin-6 consortium.\n\nSurgutneftegaz did not respond to a request for comment. Lukoil declined to comment.\n\nRosneft bought out the Surgutneftegaz and Lukoil stakes for upward of $300 million, analysts estimated, deepening its exposure to Venezuela. It also acquired a stake belonging to TNK-BP when it purchased the Russian-British firm in a $55 billion deal in 2013. That left Gazpromneft, the oil unit of state-owned gas firm Gazprom, as Rosneft\u2019s sole remaining Russian partner in Junin-6. Gazpromneft did not reply to Reuters\u2019 questions.\n\nRosneft also had four smaller oil projects with PDVSA at that time. All were experiencing problems during this period, the Rosneft internal reports show. Two of the projects, Carabobo and Petromonagas, are in the Orinoco basin; Boqueron is in the east near the Atlantic coast; Petroperija is on the Caribbean coast.\n\nRosneft internal reports from 2015 concluded that crude flow rates envisaged in the contract for the Carabobo fields were \u201cnot achievable.\u201d At Petromonagas, poor quality work caused drilling delays. At Petroperija, production was falling and the joint venture did not have the cash to buy essential pumping equipment. At the Boqueron field, a broken compressor, a device to raise gas pressure, could not be fixed because the joint venture\u2019s bank account was empty.\n\nMONEY TROUBLES\n\nIf getting oil out of its projects was a struggle for Rosneft, so was extracting revenue, the documents show.\n\nThe Russian consortium\u2019s report into operations at Junin-6 in 2012 found that PDVSA had taken $12 million from the Junin-6 budget, without Rosneft\u2019s agreement, for social spending on local people. Only 350 people lived in the area covered by the concession - some 447 square kilometers of hilly scrubland on the northern bank of the Orinoco River.\n\nIn the second half of 2014, Rosneft ordered an audit of the Junin-6 project to check for \u201cdistortion of financial accounting\u201d and \u201cunjustified expenditures.\u201d Reuters couldn\u2019t determine that audit\u2019s conclusions.\n\nRosneft managers ordered the company\u2019s own auditors to investigate money flows between PDVSA and the Petromonagas, Petroperija and Boqueron joint ventures, internal documents relating to the audit show. The audit concluded that PDVSA had understated earnings from Petromonagas oil sales by some $700 million. PDVSA challenged this figure, another document shows, and it was revised to $500 million.\n\nIn a document dated April 30, 2015, Sechin, Rosneft\u2019s chief executive, approved the findings of the audit, and a plan to protect Rosneft\u2019s investments with a series of measures to be implemented by the end of May that year.\n\nThe measures included installing metering stations to monitor how much oil was being pumped to customers, and therefore how much money the ventures should be earning. Rosneft wanted an independent assessor to track how the joint ventures spent money. And it wanted PDVSA to stop hiring its own subsidiaries without signing a contract. Reuters couldn\u2019t determine whether the measures were put into action.\n\nA few months later, in October 2015, Rosneft First Vice President Eric Liron reported to Sechin that there was still disagreement with PDVSA on settling accounts with the joint ventures. Liron wrote in a memo to Sechin: \u201cAs of 15.08.2015, PDVSA is in technical default.\u201d\n\nMonths of efforts to get the money \u2013 in which Rosneft\u2019s Venezuela office and senior executives at headquarters engaged in negotiations with PDVSA officials \u2013 went nowhere. The Rosneft internal auditor stated in the November 2015 email to his colleague that the problem was \u201cunresolved because of the poor financial health of our partner\u201d - a reference to PDVSA.\n\nDiscussing a proposal to push the internal deadline for fixing the problem to a later date, the auditor asked sardonically what would be the point. \u201cWill it (PDVSA) return to health by then, or will it die and the question will no longer be relevant?\u201d he wrote in the same email.\n\nThe auditor left Rosneft in 2016, according to his LinkedIn profile. He did not respond to a message seeking comment.\n\nRosneft was supposed to receive its share of the revenue from oil sales in the form of dividends. As of the fourth quarter of 2015, Rosneft internal presentations showed that the company was owed dividends from three of its joint ventures. The total shortfall was $337 million. The presentations listed among the strategic aims of each of the three projects: \u201cReceiving unpaid dividends\u201d from PDVSA.\n\nSince the period covered by the documents, Rosneft has acted to take greater control of its investments, for example by bringing in its own contractors. Rosneft says PDVSA has paid off much of its debt. In a financial report released on Feb. 5, 2019, Rosneft said the loans it extended to PDVSA, which had totaled about $6.5 billion, were now down to $2.3 billion.\n\nBut serious challenges remain.\n\nSlideshow (5 Images)\n\nRosneft\u2019s own reports and assessments by energy analysts show the company\u2019s projects in Venezuela are today still producing less oil than originally anticipated, with development plans either shelved or behind schedule.\n\nRosneft\u2019s flagship joint venture in Venezuela, the Junin-6 field, is still stuck in the exploration and test production phase, Rosneft wrote in its 2017 annual report. An executive at Russian partner Gazpromneft went further, saying the project is now \u201ccommercially pointless.\u201d The executive did not elaborate. Rosneft did not reply to Reuters questions about the commercial viability of the project.\n\n(Additional reporting by Oksana Kobzeva, Anton Zverev, Olesya Astakhova, Katya Golubkova, Olga Yagova, Gabrielle Tetrault-Farber, Vladimir Soldatkin, Alexander Ershov, Gleb Gorodyankin, Tatiana Ustinova and Margarita Popova in Moscow; Dmitry Zhdannikov in London; Marianna Parraga in Mexico City; Brian Ellsworth, Vivian Sequera, Alexandra Ulmer and Luc Cohen in Caracas.)",

    "description": "The U.S. announced late Monday that it is pulling the remaining staff from its embassy in Venezuela.",
    "text": "CLOSE Venezuelans continue to struggle under a blackout that has been one of the worst and longest in recent memory, in a country already suffering from serious shortages of food and medicine due to economic crisis. Video provided by AFP Newslook\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela \u2013 The United States announced late Monday that it is pulling the remaining staff from its embassy in Venezuela, citing the deteriorating situation in the South American nation.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the decision as Venezuela struggles to restore electricity following four days of blackouts around the country and a deepening political crisis.\n\nThe U.S. has led an international effort to oust socialist President Nicolas Maduro and replace him with opposition leader Juan Guaido, who vows to hold a new presidential election. Guaido is backed by some 50 countries, while Maduro maintains support from countries such as China, Russia and Cuba.\n\nMaduro had ordered all U.S. diplomats to leave Venezuela in late January because of its support from Guaido, but he retreated and allowed them to stay. The U.S. still withdrew dependents of embassy personnel as well as some of the staff. Pompeo said the remaining diplomats would be out of Venezuela by the end of the week.\n\nMore: Pompeo: Trump is confronting Obama's foreign policy failures in Venezuela, other hot spots\n\nThe move came after another day of chaos as power outages that began Thursday evening continued to cause problems for Venezuelans, leaving them with little power, water and communications.\n\nPeople converged on a polluted river to fill water bottles in Caracas, and scattered protests erupted in several cities\n\nA 3-year-old girl with a brain tumor languished in a Caracas hospital, awaiting treatment after doctors started surgery but then suspended the operation when nationwide power outages first hit on Thursday, said the girl\u2019s fearful mother, who only gave her first name, Yalimar.\n\n\u201cThe doctors told me that there are no miracles,\u201d said Yalimar, who hopes her daughter can be transferred Tuesday to one of the few hospitals in Venezuela that would be able to finish the complex procedure.\n\nThe girl\u2019s story highlighted an unfolding horror in Venezuela, where years of hardship got abruptly worse after the power grid collapsed. On Monday, schools and businesses were closed, long lines of cars waited at the few gasoline stations with electricity and hospitals cared for many patients without power. Generators have alleviated conditions for some of the critically ill.\n\nMaduro said on national television Monday night that progress had been made in restoring power in Venezuela. He also said two people who were allegedly trying to sabotage power facilities were captured and were providing information to authorities, though he gave no details.\n\nGuaido, who heads the opposition-controlled congress, and the United States say Maduro\u2019s claims that the U.S. sabotaged the power grid with a \u201ccyberattack\u201d are an attempt to divert attention from the government\u2019s own failings.\n\nThe blackouts also have hit the oil industry. The country hasn\u2019t shipped $358 million in oil since the power failures started, and \u201cthe whole system is grinding to a halt,\u201d said Russ Dallen, a Miami-based partner at the brokerage firm Caracas Capital Markets.\n\nTwo large tankers are sitting empty at the Jose offshore oil-loading dock, and at least 19 other ships are waiting their turns there, Dallen said.\n\nEngineers have restored power in some parts of Venezuela, but it often goes out again. There have been a few protests in Caracas and reports of similar anti-government anger elsewhere. Guaido tweeted about reports of looting in some cities, but details were difficult to confirm.\n\nSecurity forces in the city of Maracaibo dispersed \u201ccriminals\u201d trying to take advantage of the power cuts, Mayor Willy Casanova told local media. However, numerous videos posted on social media that purported to be from Maracaibo showed crowds roaming the streets and people running from looted, damaged buildings with no police in sight.\n\nIn Caracas, some people reported more sightings of \u201ccolectivos,\u201d a term for armed groups allegedly operating on behalf of the state to intimidate opponents.\n\nSpain\u2019s airline pilots union asked for Spanish airline Air Europa to stop flying to Venezuela after one of its crews was attacked at gunpoint in Caracas. The Sepla union said two pilots and eight more crew members of a flight from Madrid were assaulted on Saturday while going from the airport to their hotel in the Venezuelan capital. None of the crew members was injured.\n\nAir Europa responded by ordering the crews of flights to Venezuela to not spend the night in the country, according to the union.\n\nThe administration of U.S. President Donald Trump imposed sanctions on a Moscow-based bank jointly owned by Russian and Venezuelan state-owned companies, alleging it tried to circumvent U.S. sanctions on the South American country. The U.S. said it is targeting Evrofinance Mosnarbank for supporting Petroleos de Venezuela SA, the state oil company previously targeted by sanctions in January.\n\nEvrofinance said it was carrying out its activities normally despite the announcement and pledged to \u201cmeet its obligations to the clients and partners in full.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. and the other governments that recognize Guaido as Venezuela\u2019s interim president say Maduro wasn\u2019t legitimately re-elected last year because opposition candidates weren\u2019t permitted to run. Maduro says he is the target of a U.S. coup plot.\n\nAssociated Press writer Christopher Torchia contributed to this report.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2019/03/11/venezuela-us-announces-withdrawal-all-embassy-personnel/3137606002/",

    "description": "Moscow to Washington: Mind your own business.",
    "text": "President Donald Trump meets with Fabiana Rosales, the wife of Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido, on March 27, 2019. Win McNamee/Getty Images\n\nU.S. National Security Advisor John Bolton warned on Friday that the United States considers Russia\u2019s military presence in Venezuela \u201ca direct threat to international peace and security in the region.\u201d Bolton was responding to the arrival of 100 Russian military personnel in Caracas this weekend. It was just the latest condemnation from the Trump administration of Russian actions in the Venezuela crisis, but the Russian government seems unperturbed by American warnings so far.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Russians ventured into Venezuela this year. When Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido declared himself president in January, Russian contractors, associated with the Wagner group which has also carried out clandestine operations in Syria and Ukraine, appeared in Venezuela. Sources close to the Wagner group told Reuters that the contractors were sent to protect Venezuelan President Nicholas Maduro in the face of unrest.\n\nOn March 23, two Russian planes arrived in Venezuela, carrying 100 Russian servicemen and 35 tons of cargo, according to Tass. This time, they were official members of the Russian military, not contractors. CBS News reports that Russia routinely deploys military advisers and technicians to Venezuela, but that the number sent this time suggests this operation is \u201cmore than routine.\u201d On March 25, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the Russian foreign minister to tell him that the U.S. \u201cwill not stand idly by as Russia exacerbates tensions in Venezuela\u201d and to condemn the \u201cinsertion of Russian military personnel to support the illegitimate regime of Nicolas Maduro.\u201d In response, a Foreign Ministry spokeswoman stated that Russian presence in Venezuela was entirely lawful, citing an agreement between Russia and Venezuela on military-technical cooperation.\n\nTensions escalated on Wednesday, when President Trump told journalists that Russia had to \u201cget out\u201d of Venezuela while meeting with Guaido\u2019s wife. Guaido has been recognized by the U.S. and most other countries in the region as the legitimate ruler of Venezuela since he challenged Maduro\u2019s rule.\n\nDisregarding Trump\u2019s demand for removing all military personnel from the country, Russian Presidential Spokesman Dmitri Peskov told the U.S. to mind its own business. \u201cWe don\u2019t think that third parties should worry about our bilateral relations with other countries. We don\u2019t interfere in Venezuela\u2019s domestic affairs and expect third countries to do the same,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cAs for the United States, it is present in many parts of the world but no one tells Washington where it should be and where it shouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nVenezuela under Maduro and his predecessor Hugo Chavez became an important strategic partner to Russia. Over the years, Venezuela has spent billions of dollars on Russian military equipment as the largest buyer of Russian arms in the Western hemisphere. Since 2010, Russia has also invested over $9 billion in Venezuelan oil projects. As Vox points out, the strong economic links between two states are key to understanding Russia\u2019s continued entanglement in Venezuelan politics.\n\nThis week, both the Russians and the Americans have repeatedly escalated their, with neither side showing any signs of backing down. Although the situation is unlikely to break out into an actual conflict, the increased Russian presence in Latin America is a testament to Putin\u2019s foreign policy priorities and his disregard for American ultimatums.",

    "title": "State attorneys general: Donald Trump's national emergency declaration is constitutional",
    "description": "In declaring a state of emergency, President Trump is using pre-existing statutory authority to address a legitimate crisis.",
    "text": "CLOSE President Trump declared a national emergency to free up funding for his border wall between the U.S and Mexico. But declaring a national emergency isn\u2019t new -- in fact, the use of emergency powers is older than the country itself. USA TODAY, Just the FAQs\n\nIn declaring a state of emergency, President Trump is using pre-existing statutory authority to address a legitimate crisis, say attorneys general from Texas, Indiana and Louisiana.\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s emergency declaration is a proper use of executive power to protect our country\u2019s borders and keep Americans safe. Unfortunately, the crisis at the southern border is one that only the federal government may truly solve. With no solutions coming from Congress, the president is faithfully executing the duties of his office by invoking a law Congress already passed: the National Emergencies Act (NEA).\n\nIn declaring a state of emergency pursuant to the NEA, President Trump is using pre-existing statutory authority to address a legitimate crisis created by lawless conduct at and beyond our southern border. This emergency declaration is not a case of the president relieving himself of restrictions under the law. To the contrary, our president is protecting our country\u2019s borders through means contemplated by Congress and used many times by past presidents for matters less directly threatening than those present on the southern border.\n\nPresident Donald Trump (Photo: Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nOUR VIEW: 41 Republican senators pledge loyalty to royalty\n\nThe NEA gives the president broad authority. In fact, Congress did not define \u201cnational emergency\u201d in the NEA, leaving it entirely at the president\u2019s discretion to determine what constitutes such an emergency. But any president who makes such a declaration must tell Congress the statutory authority upon which he is relying, as President Trump has done here. The president\u2019s action is neither new nor extraordinary.\n\nThe NEA has been used by every president since its adoption in 1976 and has been invoked more than 50 times. Past administrations issued emergency declarations on a wide variety of issues with less direct impact on the safety and security of Americans \u2014 including the sale of blood diamonds (Clinton) and misconduct by multiple foreign governments like Burundi (Obama), South Sudan (Clinton, Obama), Venezuela (Obama) and North Korea (Bush).\n\nMany of these declarations have renewed annually for years or decades. The emergency declaration in response to the Iranian hostage crisis, for example, has been renewed each year since it was declared in 1979. (The hostages were released in 1981.)\n\nRead more commentary:\n\nTrump border emergency is fake and climate crisis is real. Guess which just got funded?\n\nRepublicans are starting to stand up to Trump. But will they reject his national emergency?\n\nSenate Republicans will commit institutional treason if they support Trump's 'emergency'\n\nEveryone knows there is a massive problem with illegal immigration and international organized crime operating on our borders. Congress has been talking about the crisis at the southern border for decades. Up until recently, border security was a bipartisan issue. In 2005, New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson \u2014 a Democrat who served in President Bill Clinton\u2019s Cabinet \u2014 declared a state of emergency at his state\u2019s southern border. In announcing the state of emergency, Richardson criticized the \u201ctotal inaction and lack of resources from the federal government and Congress\u201d in helping protect his state\u2019s residents along the border. In describing the crisis, the 2005 declaration stated New Mexico has been \u201cdevastated by the ravages and terror of human smuggling, drug smuggling, kidnapping, murder, destruction of property and the death of livestock.\u201d\n\nObama unlawfully used executive power\n\nAs state attorneys general, we are the chief legal officers of our states, with the duty to defend our sovereigns from federal overreach. We have been quick to challenge executive actions that exceed the president\u2019s lawful authority.\n\nPresident Trump\u2019s emergency declaration to address the crisis at the southern border is much different than the kinds of executive action we challenged in the past. Unlike President Barack Obama, who unlawfully used executive power to create new laws or rewrite laws Congress enacted, President Trump is lawfully using executive power to address a crisis worsened by congressional inaction. That is a stark difference but not the only one: This use of executive action is part of the core duties of the president \u2014 to protect the borders of our country. In doing so, he properly invoked power that Congress expressly granted him to deal with a national crisis.\n\nAstonishingly, multiple meritless complaints have been filed against the president\u2019s emergency declaration. This is the first time ever in the history of the NEA that the president has faced a court challenge. In four decades and more than 50 emergency declarations, only now has anyone challenged the president\u2019s determination that an emergency exists.\n\nThe facts support Trump \u2014 Congress should, too\n\nThe funding sources proposed by the president are also proper. Out of the $8 billion needed to address the crisis on the southern border, $4.5 billion does not depend on any declaration of a national emergency: $1.375 billion has already been appropriated by Congress, $600 million comes from the Treasury Department\u2019s asset forfeiture fund and $2.5 billion stems from the Pentagon\u2019s drug interdiction program fund, which specifically contemplates building a barrier that prevents drugs from crossing a border.\n\nIt is only the $3.6 billion from the Pentagon\u2019s military construction project budget that requires a national emergency declaration. Even then, the only funds that can be used are funds that have been appropriated but not otherwise obligated. Therefore, any argument that any particular state would otherwise have gotten some of these funds for military construction projects in their states is entirely speculative.\n\nThe facts matter \u2014 these facts show the president has acted lawfully and within the scope of discretion Congress and the people vested in him. Congress should support President Trump.\n\nKen Paxton is attorney general of Texas and chairman of the Republican Attorneys General Association.

REUTERS/Hannah Mckay/File Photo\n\nPolitical crises have pushed up borrowing costs in euro zone countries such as Greece and Italy in recent years.\n\nIn Britain, Parliament has rejected May\u2019s divorce deal three times and failed to back an alternative, risking a chaotic no-deal Brexit as soon as April 12, although May on Tuesday announced cross-party talks to break the impasse.\n\nBut interest rates on Britain\u2019s roughly 1.5 trillion pounds ($2.0 trillion) of government bonds, known as gilts, have fallen.\n\nThe main reason is that gilts, representing one of the world\u2019s major government bond markets, are influenced mostly by the ebbs and flows of the global economy and financial markets.\n\nBut other factors are at work too.\n\nBelow is a look at some of the reasons for the strong demand for gilts in the face of Britain\u2019s political chaos.\n\nGLOBAL SLOWDOWN\n\nThe central banks of the United States and the euro zone recently rowed back on their plans to remove the stimulus they have been providing since the global financial crisis, reflecting worries about a slowdown in the global economy.\n\nThis has been a major factor in driving gilt yields lower and they have fallen this year in step with those of other major government bonds across the Group of Seven rich countries.\n\nFor a graphic on G7 benchmark 10-year government bond yields, see - tmsnrt.rs/2CRlp8T\n\nLast week the 10-year gilt yield fell below 1 percent for the first time in 18 months, although it rebounded to 1.07 percent on Wednesday as investors judged May\u2019s latest plan as likely to cut the risk of a no-deal Brexit.\n\nSTILL A SAFE HAVEN\n\nBritish government bonds retain high credit ratings even after losing their top-notch triple-A grades as Britain\u2019s economy and public finances struggled to recover from effects of last decade\u2019s global financial crisis.\n\nPart of gilts\u2019 appeal is Britain\u2019s track record, stretching back hundreds of years, of not defaulting on its debt, bolstered by the fact it issues its own currency.\n\nAlthough British government debt levels rocketed in the aftermath of the crisis, gilts are still regarded by investors as a safe place to store money when the going gets tough.\n\n\u201cUltimately, there\u2019s someone always willing to buy the debt, unless you make a complete hash of it \u2014 we\u2019re talking the Venezuela, Turkey arena,\u201d said Marc Ostwald, chief economist at ADM Investor Services.\n\nBIG DOMESTIC OWNERSHIP\n\nBritish domestic investors like pension funds and insurance firms, plus the Bank of England, account for the vast majority of gilt holdings, cutting the risk that a sell-off from foreign owners of gilts would wreak havoc in the market.\n\nForeign owners accounted for 25 percent of British government debt securities in 2017, compared with 30 percent in Italy and 47 percent in France, according to Eurostat data.\n\nLONG IN THE TOOTH\n\nWhen a government bond matures, meaning the government repays bondholders what they have lent it, they have an opportunity to move their money elsewhere if they choose.\n\nThe average maturity for gilts is much longer than for equivalent European government bonds, meaning investors have fewer opportunities to move out of British debt \u2014 another factor that adds to the relative stability of gilts.\n\nThe average maturity for British bonds is 14.9 years, compared with 7.5 in France, 6.9 in Italy, and 6.3 in Germany, according to European Central Bank data.\n\nBREXIT EFFECT? LOOK TO THE FTSE\n\nGilts\u2019 current strength also probably reflects the relatively poor performance of the British stock market, which along with the pound has borne the brunt of shifts in investor appetite in response to Brexit developments.\n\nAlthough the FTSE 100 is up 10 percent year-to-date, it is vying with Spain\u2019s IBEX as the worst performer among the major European bourses in 2019.\n\nSome of the money that could have sent British stocks higher probably found its way into gilts.\n\n\u201cPeople say \u2018what about Brexit?\u2019, but investors say \u2018where else am I meant to invest my money\u2019?\u201d Ostwald said.\n\nFor a graphic on Performance of European stock markets in year-to-date, see - tmsnrt.rs/2CSg4OK",

Guaido declared himself interim president in January in a move Maduro described as an attempted coup.\n\nGuaido did not attend the summit, nor send a representative as had been expected.\n\nAlso absent were Bolivian President Evo Morales - a close ally of Maduro - and Uruguay's President Tabare Vazquez. Uruguay had, along with Mexico been urging regional powers to work with the Maduro administration to find a solution to Venezuela's multiple crises, but changed gear in February, calling for new elections.\n\nAl Jazeera's Lucia Newman, reporting from Santiago, said Prosur was already facing criticism from some who see it as a right-wing rebranding of Unasur.\n\n\"There are a lot of people of think that the point of Prosur, at least in the short term, is to be yet another forum, another mechanism for putting pressure on Maduro and forcing him out of power.\n\n190308182845194\n\n\"A lot of people who are even critical of Maduro say that this organisation, rather than favouring and defending multilateralism, seems to be playing into this new right-wing populist wave in the region,\" she said. \"They say it must be pluralistic because governments change, but institutions should not\".\n\nUnasur was created in 2008 when the leftist populism advocated by Maduro's predecessor Hugo Chavez was at its strongest in South America, but in recent years, the bloc has been paralysed by divisions as centre-right governments have risen to power.",

    "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Venezuela\u2019s socialist regime on Thursday barred opposition leader Juan Guaido from holding public office for 15 years, in a move that\u2019s sure to further fuel tensions in the crisis-ravaged nation.\n\nComptroller Elvis Amoroso speaking on state television said that Guaido had filed false and misleading personal financial disclosure statements, which documented spending that vastly exceeded the income of a public servant.\n\nAmoroso asked tax authorities to probe national hotels \u201cfor luxury stays, logistics and banquets\" allegedly purchased by the opposition leader. Guaido, the head of the opposition-dominated National Assembly who\u2019s recognized by the U.S. and some 50 other nations as Venezuela\u2019s rightful leader, responded shortly thereafter at a rally in Caracas.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re upset because we\u2019re recouping the money they stole,\u201d Guaido said. \u201cThey continue to attack an interim president, but we\u2019ll continue in the streets.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear if the measure would end Guaido\u2019s current term in congress or what affect it would have -- if any -- on his bid to unseat President Nicolas Maduro.\n\n\u2018Usurped\u2019 Public Functions\n\nThe probe was opened in January after the 35-year-old lawmaker invoked Venezuela\u2019s charter to launch an interim government and kicked off a wave of national protests after Maduro began another six-year term following 2018 elections that were widely regarded as rigged.\n\nWhile Guaido has so far been unable to break Maduro\u2019s grip on key institutions at home, specifically the military, he has gained widespread support abroad. The U.S. has since levied crippling sanctions against the Maduro government and frozen assets abroad.\n\nLast month, Guaido broke a travel ban and met with Vice President Mike Pence in Colombia, toured South America and sat down with a half dozen heads of state as he sought to drum up regional and international support.\n\nAmoroso said Guaido had \u201cusurped\u201d public functions and coordinated with foreign governments to harm Venezuela and demanded the maximum penalty allowed. According to Venezuelan law, the National Assembly would have to lift Guaido\u2019s parliamentary immunity following a Supreme Court request based on a review of the reasons for doing so from the Public Prosecutor\u2019s office.\n\nIn the past, the government has use this tactic to sideline popular opponents of Maduro and his predecessor, the late Hugo Chavez. When Chavez ran for re-election in 2012, Leopoldo Lopez dropped out of the opposition primary, citing obstacles stemming from just such a government ban, and threw his support behind Henrique Capriles. Capriles was later banned from holding office after he lost to Maduro in 2013.\n\n--With assistance from Alex Vasquez.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Andrew Rosati in Caracas at arosati3@bloomberg.net;Patricia Laya in Caracas at playa2@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Vivianne Rodrigues at vrodrigues3@bloomberg.net, Robert Jameson\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.",

(Feb. 28) AP\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Secretary of State Mike Pompeo bristled in an exclusive interview with USA TODAY when asked about some of the president\u2019s recent statements and major policies, seeking instead to highlight a series of domestic trips the top diplomat is taking to Iowa, Kansas and Texas.\n\nPompeo was confrontational when pressed about the failed North Korea negotiations, the status of China trade negotiations, and the possible political nature of his own domestic travel.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a ridiculous statement,\u201d Pompeo said Saturday when asked if his travel to Iowa, which hosts the first-in-the-nation presidential caucus, was tied to President Donald Trump's 2020 re-election campaign.\n\nPompeo also repeatedly argued that said many of global challenges the Trump administration now faces were created by President Barack Obama's inaction or misguided foreign policies. \u201cEach of the problems that we\u2019ve spoken about today ... the Obama administration did nothing to address any of them,\" Pompeo said.\n\nHere's what Pompeo had to say about pressing international issues:\n\nOtto Warmbier tragedy: Did Kim know?\n\nOtto Warmbier during a press conference on Monday, Feb. 29, 2016, in Pyongyang, North Korea. (Photo: Kim Kwang Hyon, AP)\n\nDid North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un know about the mistreatment of American college student Otto Warmbier, who was held for 15 months in North Korea and died shortly after his release? Trump said he believed Kim when Kim said he didn't know.\n\nPompeo seemed annoyed by questions about Trump's statements. Pressed about Kim's personal responsibility and whether Kim knew about Warmbier\u2019s case, Pompeo fell silent before saying he had answered the question and been \u201cvery patient\u201d with that line of inquiry.\n\nWhat Pompeo did say: \u201cThe North Korean regime is responsible for the death Otto Warmbier and the humanitarian violations that are continuing to take place.\u201d\n\nExperts say it's not plausible that Kim didn't know about Warmbier.\n\nNorth Korea summit: Stalemate or not?\n\nPompeo also rejected the idea that Trump\u2019s summit in Hanoi with the North Korean dictator had resulted in stalemate, and he said the Trump administration would not resume joint military exercises with South Korea.\n\nThe secretary reacted angrily when asked about the North Korean foreign minister's statement, made hours after the talks dissolved, that the offer Kim made in Hanoi was final.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not what the North Koreans said,\u201d Pompeo responded. \u201cDon\u2019t say things that aren\u2019t true. ... Show me the quote from the North Koreans that said this was their one and only offer. Where\u2019d you get that?\u201d\n\nAfter he was read a quote from Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho \u2013 in which he said \u201cour proposal will never be changed\u201d \u2013 Pompeo was quiet for about six seconds. Then he countered, \u201cWhat they said is they\u2019re prepared to continue conversations with us and that\u2019s what we intend to do.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald J.

(Photo: LUONG THAI LINH, EPA-EFE)\n\nVenezuela's political crisis\n\nPompeo did not answer a question about whether the U.S. was helping opposition leader Juan Guaido return to Venezuela. The Trump administration is pushing for the ouster of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and has recognized Guaido as the country's legitimate leader.\n\nBut Maduro has maintained his grip on power; Guaido returned to Venezuela on Monday. The Maduro regime has threatened to arrest him.\n\nPompeo said the Trump administration has made progress in addressing the political and humanitarian crisis there. \"We\u2019re working to help the duly elected interim president Guaido assert his power and get food and humanitarian aid assistance in to starving people,\" he said.\n\nAfghanistan's future\n\nU.S. soldiers from NATO look on as U.S. flag flies in a checkpoint during a patrol against Islamic State militants at the Deh Bala district in the eastern province of Nangarhar Province in Afghanistan on July 7, 2018. (Photo: WAKIL KOHSAR, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe Trump administration is negotiating a peace deal with the Taliban that could bring an end to the 17-year war there. The Taliban have agreed in principle not to allow Afghanistan to be used as a haven for terrorists plotting future attacks against the U.S.\n\nBut Afghan women are terrified that if the Taliban return to power, they will lose all the rights they've gained under the new Afghan government. The Taliban barred girls from attending school, forbade women from appearing in public unless escorted by a man and beat women who did not comply with their strict edicts.\n\nAsked about those fears, Pompeo said, \u201cWe are working to get a reconciliation agreement that will be good for every Afghan \u2013 men, women, children.\"\n\nReaching a trade deal with China\n\nPompeo said the Trump administration is making good progress in its trade negotiations with China, which touch on everything from market access to intellectual property theft. He sharply rejected any suggestion that the talks were taking a long time to produce a deal, pivoting again to Trump's predecessor, President Obama.\n\n\"It\u2019s just been two years that this administration\u2019s had the opportunity to course correct from the disastrous policies that the Obama administration put in place to allow China to steal the heartbeat of agricultural America,\" he said. \"The Chinese were stealing us blind.\"\n\nTrump recently said the trade negotiations have been \"very productive,\" and he agreed to delay a threatened increase in tariffs against China.

    "description": "The United States is halting humanitarian funding to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, just days after Trump warned of a new migrant caravan heading toward the U.S. border.",
    "text": "CLOSE Speaking to reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort, President Donald Trump said there's \"a very good likelihood\" that he'll be closing the U.S. southern border next week if Mexico does not immediately stop illegal immigration. (March 29) AP, AP\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 The United States is halting humanitarian funding to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, the State Department confirmed on Saturday.\n\nThe move comes just days after President Donald Trump warned of a new migrant caravan heading toward the southern U.S. border and issued warnings that he planned to close the U.S.-Mexico border next week if Mexico did not do more to stop caravans of migrants, many fleeing Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador, from attempting to gain entry into the U.S.\n\n\"At the Secretary\u2019s instruction, we are carrying out the President\u2019s direction and ending FY 2017 and FY 2018 foreign assistance programs for the Northern Triangle,\" a State Department spokesperson told USA TODAY. \"We will be engaging Congress as part of this process.\"\n\nTrump has long threatened to cut off humanitarian aid to the countries, including before the 2018 midterm elections when he held a slew of rallies and warned of an \"invasion\" of migrants from the countries. He recently declared a national emergency at the border to secure funding for a proposed wall, despite Congressional opposition.\n\nMore: Trump threatens to seal the border if Mexico doesn't 'immediately stop' immigrants\n\nMore: How US foreign policy in Central America may have fueled the migrant crisis\n\nOn Friday, the president threatened to close the U.S.-Mexico border if Mexico didn't stop undocumented migrants from coming.\n\n\"There\u2019s a very good likelihood that I\u2019ll be closing the border next week,\" Trump told reporters gathered at his Florida resort. \"I will close the border if Mexico doesn\u2019t get with it.\"\n\nHistorically, the United States has viewed foreign aid programs to Central American countries as a vital component of stabilizing the countries, potentially halting the flow of immigrants seeking to migrate to the United States. Under Trump, aid to the countries had already plummeted.\n\nThe U.S. provided about $131 million in aid to Guatemala, $98 million to Honduras, and $68 million to El Salvador in 2016, according to Reuters. The following year the funding fell to about $69 million for Guatemala, $66 million for Honduras and $46 million for El Salvador.\n\nIn April, Trump also threatened to withdraw aid from Honduras a caravan of migrants fled the country. The group, which grew to as many as 1,600 migrants, grew smaller as it moved north. By the time they reached Tijuana, on the Mexican side of the southern U.S. border, only about 300 migrants remained.\n\nHonduras' murder rate has declined in recent years but it still had the fourth-highest rate among Latin American nations in 2017 at 42.8 per 100,000 residents, according to Insight Crime. Only Venezuela, El Salvador and Jamaica suffered more murders in the region that year.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, 66 percent of Hondurans live in poverty and about one out of five Hondurans in rural areas live on less than $1.90 a day.\n\nMore: 'We\u2019ve never seen anything like this': As Trump threatens to close border, migrants overwhelm Texas cities\n\nLong before Trump took office, the United States had a checkered history of involvement in Central America \u2013 and some say American foreign policy in the region caused the instability and inequality at the root of the current crisis.\n\nThere was the CIA\u2019s covert operation to overthrow Guatemala\u2019s democratically elected president in 1954. And America\u2019s intervention in El Salvador\u2019s civil war in the 1980s. And the Obama administration\u2019s refusal in 2009 to label the ouster of Honduras\u2019 president a military coup \u2013 even though soldiers dragged him out of bed in the middle of the night and sent him into exile in his pajamas.\n\nJeff Faux, a distinguished fellow at the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, said the decades-long history of American intervention has left Central American governments weak and fragile while empowering oligarchs and drug cartels, which has, in turn, fueled the corruption and gang violence that drives residents to flee.\n\nContributing: John Fritze, Deirdre Shesgreen and William Cummings\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/03/30/united-states-cuts-aid-guatemala-honduras-el-salvador-migrant-crisis/3320401002/",

    "text": "Around two-thirds of those facing severe food shortages live in war-torn countries like Yemen\n\nMore than 113 million people across 53 countries experienced \"acute hunger\" last year because of wars and climate disasters, with Africa the worst-hit region, the UN said Tuesday.\n\nYemen, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Afghanistan and Syria were among the eight nations accounting for two-thirds of the total number of people worldwide exposed to the risk of famine, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said in its 2019 global report on food crises.\n\nLaunched three years ago, the annual study takes stock of the countries facing the greatest difficulties.\n\nAfrican states were \"disproportionally\" affected as close to 72 million people on the continent suffered acute hunger, the FAO's emergencies director Dominique Bourgeon told AFP on Tuesday.\n\nConflict and insecurity remained key factors, along with economic turbulence and climate-related shocks like drought and floods, the report found.\n\nIn countries on the verge of famine, \"up to 80 percent of the population depend on agriculture. They need both emergency humanitarian aid for food and measures to help boost agriculture,\" Bourgeon said.\n\nThe report highlighted the strain put on countries hosting large numbers of refugees, including neighbouring nations of war-torn Syria as well as Bangladesh, which has received more than a million Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar.\n\nMaps on food insecurity in the world, according to data from UN Food and Agriculture Organization.\n\nVenezuela food crisis\n\nThe FAO said it also expected the number of displaced people to increase \"if the political and economic crisis persists in Venezuela\" which is likely to declare a food emergency this year.\n\nBourgeon said he was concerned by the \"important and significative rise\" in poverty in Venezuela, as it grapples with dire economic and living conditions worsened by an ongoing political crisis.\n\nGlobally, the study noted that the overall situation slightly improved in 2018 compared to 2017 when 124 million people suffered acute hunger.\n\nThe drop can partially be attributed to the fact that some countries in Latin America and the Asia Pacific region for instance were less affected by weather disasters that had struck in previous years.\n\nHowever, the FAO warned that the year-on-year trend of more than 100 million people facing famine was unlikely to change in the face of continued crises.\n\nAfghanistan, Iraq and Syria all suffered bad droughts in 2018, which severely impacted agricultural output.\n\nThe FAO also stressed that \"high levels of acute and chronic malnutrition in children living in emergency conditions remained of grave concern\".\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP",

    "description": "Yesterday, Google announced it\u2019s teaming up with Cuba\u2019s telecommunications monopoly, ETECSA, in order to bring faster Internet access to the island.

    "text": "Yesterday, Google announced it\u2019s teaming up with Cuba\u2019s telecommunications monopoly, ETECSA, in order to bring faster Internet access to the island. The news is no doubt a relief for Cuba\u2019s citizenry, who have to endure high Internet costs and excruciatingly slow speeds. These factors combine to give Cuba one of the lowest Internet penetration rates in the Western hemisphere.\n\nBut why is a middle-income country, situated within spitting distance of the United States, a digital dead-zone? The answer is actually fairly interesting and involves a number of factors.\n\nDude, where\u2019s my cables?\n\nThere\u2019s a massive network of undersea fiber optic cables in the ocean. These connect disparate locales, ferrying bits and bytes at the speed of light. Just to give you a sense of how important these are, according to a 2017 report published by the UK-based think tank Policy Exchange, submarine cables were responsible for carrying around 97 percent of the world\u2019s communication traffic.\n\nMost countries with a maritime border are connected to several undersea cables. The first reason for this is redundancy: if one breaks (which happens often), there\u2019s a backup. More cables means you\u2019re able to transmit more traffic, too, which is essential if you\u2019ve got a data-hungry populace.\n\nCuba is connected to just one cable. In 2013, the country activated a $70 million, 1,600 kilometer (994 mile) pipeline to Venezuela. Prior to that, it relied on excruciatingly expensive satellite connections, which cost a small fortune to operate, and offered limited bandwidth. This all but kept the Internet out of the hands of everyone, except a handful of elites.\n\nYou know, government officials. Foreign diplomats. Tourists.\n\nSo, now you\u2019re probably wondering why Cuba\u2019s so behind the times. The answer, of course, involves politics.\n\nEmbargo Shmembargo\n\nFor a tiny country of just over 11 million in the Caribbean, Cuba played an oversized role in the Cold War. Remember the Cuban Missile Crisis? The clue is in the name.\n\nThe past 60 years of Cuba\u2019s history has been centered around a deep-seated animosity with the nearest superpower \u2013 the US. In an attempt to stymie the only outpost of communism in North America, America placed Cuba under a crushing embargo that prevented it from doing business with the outside world.\n\nFor a really long time, American companies couldn\u2019t sell telecommunications equipment to Cuba. It\u2019s worth remembering that American firms dominate the tech world, and it\u2019s almost impossible to have any sort of infrastructure without any US-origin parts (although is likely getting easier, thanks to the rise of China as a tech giant in its own right).\n\nThankfully, that restriction was lifted by President Obama in 2009, as tensions between the two countries thawed. It remains to be seen what changes Trump\u2019s presidency will mean for the effort to connect Cuba to the Internet, however.\n\nDon\u2019t forget authoritarianism\n\nIt\u2019s not just America. As an authoritarian regime with an abysmal human rights record, Cuba\u2019s got an incentive to keep its citizens offline, and regularly harasses and arrests digital dissidents. Reporters Without Borders calls the nation an \u201cInternet Enemy,\u201d putting in the same list as North Korea, Syria, and Iran.\n\nThe censorship manifests itself in a really interesting way. While there\u2019s not much actual site-level blocking, Cuba does surveil its citizens online. You could also make a convincing case that the country has deliberately rationed access in order to keep it out of the hands of the masses.\n\nIn December 2009, Cuba arrested a US citizen, Alan Gross, after he smuggled Internet equipment into the country, destined for the nation\u2019s tiny Jewish community. Gross would spend six years incarcerated before eventually being released in 2014.\n\nAnd here we are.\n\nLet\u2019s go back to Google. There\u2019s currently no hard timeframe for when Cubans will get faster access to the likes of YouTube, Search, and Google Play. According to Reuters, engineers from Google and ETECSA will work together to find a solution. Overall, the details are thin on the ground, but it seems like Google\u2019s advocating for a \u201cpeering agreement,\u201d where ETECSA has a direct line to Google\u2019s infrastructure.\n\nThis would lower costs, as Cubans wouldn\u2019t have to pay in order to access Google via an intermediary network. It\u2019ll also offer markedly faster access. However, it\u2019ll undoubtedly require new submarine infrastructure. Cuba will either have to connect to one of Google\u2019s \u201cpoints of presence.\u201d The nearest ones to Havana are in Florida, Mexico, and Colombia.\n\nBut make no mistake, solving Cuba\u2019s Internet woes won\u2019t just be solved by thicker pipelines and faster routers. This isn\u2019t just a technical problem. A good deal of diplomacy is required, too.\n\nGiven the history of the country, you can be forgiven for wondering how we ended up in a position where a communist monopoly is teaming up with Google. The reality is that Cuba\u2019s arrival on the Internet stage may have been severely delayed, but it\u2019s certainly been rapid.\n\nInternet caf\u00e9s were followed by public Wi-Fi hotspots, and since December, Cuba\u2019s had widespread mobile Internet. Around two million people, or about 18 percent of the country, now pays for 3G internet, which they access through their smartphones. And that\u2019s before we get into the phenomenon of mesh networks and \u201cel paquete semanal\u201d \u2013 shared USB drives packed with clandestine content, like cached websites and telenovellas.\n\nUltimately, this story tells us that the Internet is a bell that cannot be un-rung. If you give people a sip, they\u2019ll want to drink the whole glass.\n\nTNW Conference 2019 is coming!

    "text": "US President Donald Trump has called on Russia to pull its troops from Venezuela and warned \"all options\" were open to making that happen.\n\nThe arrival of two Russian air force planes carrying nearly 100 Russian troops outside Caracas on Saturday has escalated the political crisis in Venezuela.\n\nRussia and China have backed President Nicolas Maduro, while the United States and most Western countries support opposition leader Juan Guaido. In January, Guaido invoked the constitution to declare himself interim president, arguing Maduro's 2018 re-election was illegitimate.\n\nThe US government says the Russian troops include special forces and cybersecurity personnel.\n\n\"They've got a lot of pressure right now. They have no money, they have no oil, they have no nothing. They've got plenty of pressure right now. They have no electricity,\" Trump said.\n\n\"Other than military, you can't get any more pressure than they have... All options are open,\" he added.\n\nRussia has bilateral relations and agreements with Venezuela, which it plans to honour, Russian Deputy UN Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy said, in response to Trump's comments.\n\n\"It's not up to US to decide actions and fate of other countries. It's only up to the people of Venezuela and its only legitimate President Nicolas Maduro,\" Polyanskiy said on Twitter.\n\nIt's not up to US to decide actions and fate of other countries.

She was accompanied by the wife and sister of Roberto Marrero, Guaido's chief of staff, who was arrested and detained last week.\n\n#AHORA | Fabiana Rosales cuenta en reuni\u00f3n con el presidente Donald Trump c\u00f3mo el r\u00e9gimen de Nicol\u00e1s Maduro ha intentado intimidar a su esposo a trav\u00e9s de detenciones a sus allegados https://t.co/fcFbGKyUWQ \u2193 pic.twitter.com/zyybrznYOj \u2014 NTN24 (@NTN24) March 27, 2019\n\nEarlier at the White House, Rosales met Vice President Mike Pence and told him power outages and food shortages were hurting children in her country.\n\n\"They are trying to break our morale.

But let me tell you that there is light, and the light is here,\" Rosales told Pence.\n\nShe is slated to meet US first lady Melania Trump in Palm Beach on Thursday on a quick stop in south Florida, home to the largest community of Venezuelan exiles in the United States.\n\nRosales is also slated to meet politicians on Capitol Hill and members of the Venezuelan diaspora at a prominent Washington think-tank.\n\nPence praised Rosales for being \"courageous\".\n\n\"Our message very simply is: We're with you,\" Pence said\n\nOngoing electricity outages\n\nMeanwhile, the country is experiencing its second major blackout, which has left the streets of Caracas mostly empty, and residents wondering how long power would be out amid a deepening economic crisis.\n\nMaduro said an \"attack\" on its electrical system caused the blackout that first hit on Monday. The outage closed businesses, paralysed the country's main oil export terminal, and stranded commuters.\n\nIntermittent service has long affected Venezuela's largely rural interior, but residents of Caracas fear the increasing blackouts in the capital mean that unreliable power is becoming the new normal for them, too.\n\n\"I hope that now with these blackouts in Caracas they can do something, that everyone reacts,\" said Maria Melendez, a seamstress in the western city of Punto Fijo who said she has had to replace damaged appliances during previous blackouts.\n\n\"They used to say that Caracas is Caracas, and everywhere else is weeds and snakes. Now, Caracas will also be weeds and snakes if we continue like this.\"",

    "title": "Oil Prices Are at Risk of Spiking as the Venezuelan Crisis Deepens",
    "description": "The South American country's electricity woes threaten to shut off its oil pumps.",
    "text": "The global oil market is a delicate thing. While roughly 100 million barrels per day (BPD) move around the world, the slightest change in the level of either supply or demand can wreak havoc on oil prices. That was abundantly evident last fall, when crude prices crashed 40% after supplies outpaced demand by around 2 million BPD because U.S. sanctions on Iran weren't as powerful as promised.\n\nCrude prices, however, have sharply reversed course in 2019, thanks in part to OPEC's decision to reduce its output. That might only be the beginning because supplies from Venezuela, which have already fallen off a cliff, are at risk of tumbling further as that country's economic and humanitarian crisis deepens. Add those supply concerns to faster-than-expected demand growth, and oil prices could spike in the coming months, which could fuel big gains in the stock prices of financially weaker oil producers.\n\nThe delicate balance might not last\n\nOPEC, in coordination with several non-member nations, reduced its output to start this year, which helped get oil market fundamentals back into balance. However, the International Energy Agency's (IEA) latest monthly report on the oil market contained a stark warning. The IEA pointed out that \"during the past week, industry operations [in Venezuela] were seriously disrupted\" by power outages in the country, and that \"ongoing losses on a significant scale could present a challenge to the market.\"\n\nThe country has been producing about 1.2 million BPD, which is a sizable decline from the 2 million BPD it was pumping out in 2017 and well below its peak of 3 million BPD in the late 1990s. Output, however, could decline much further due to the country's electricity crisis because oil pumps need power to produce. It's possible that supplies could drop by more than half if Venezuela doesn't quickly restore power to the poorer rural areas where it pumps out the bulk of its oil.\n\nIf that were to happen, it could significantly disrupt the oil market, causing prices to spike further, especially since oil demand has come in higher than expected so far this year. According to a forecast by investment bank Goldman Sachs, oil demand is on pace to grow by nearly 2 million BPD during the first quarter, blowing past its estimate of a 1.1 million BPD increase. While the IEA isn't quite as bullish since it hasn't altered its full-year forecast, the potential for faster-than-expected demand growth coming at a time of a possible supply shortage could fuel a big spike in oil prices -- at least until OPEC starts reversing its earlier production cuts.\n\nWhat this means for oil investors\n\nGoldman Sachs believes that faster demand growth alone could push the global oil benchmark back over $70 a barrel, up from its current level in the mid-$60s. If that were to happen, oil stocks would likely surge, as higher oil prices would boost their cash flows.\n\nWhile that rising tide would likely lift all boats, financially weaker oil producers could be among the biggest beneficiaries because those companies need higher prices to give them the cash flows to more quickly pay down their larger debt loads. Two names to keep an eye on are Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) and Denbury Resources (NYSE:DNR). Shares of both companies spiked through the first half of last year as oil prices rallied, with Chesapeake surging more than 35% at one point while Denbury zoomed nearly 200%. Both stocks, however, cratered as oil prices sold off during the fourth quarter, causing Chesapeake Energy to end the year down almost 50% while Denbury Resources finished lower by 23%.\n\nThis year's more-than-20% rebound in oil prices has already spurred a more-than-40% rally in Chesapeake's stock price. Denbury is up about 5%. Both stocks could continue rebounding if oil prices spike, since that would boost their cash flows and ease the pressure on their balance sheets. On the other hand, if Venezuela quickly stabilizes or oil demand growth slows, these oil stocks would likely be among the hardest hit.\n\nOil price volatility appears poised to increase\n\nWhile crude prices have already rebounded sharply this year, they could have much further to run, especially if Venezuela's power crisis deepens at the same time demand growth accelerates. That could cause big spikes in the stock prices of financially weaker oil producers. However, while it's tempting to want to buy that type of oil stock in hopes of a quick profit, that decision could come back to burn buyers given that volatility can cut both ways. That's why investors are better off considering producers that can still make money at lower prices, as they offer solid upside if oil keeps going higher but with less risk than their weaker peers if it tumbles again.",

He said they should gather across the country at 11am (15:30 GMT).\n\n\"See you tomorrow,\" Guaido said in a live video address on social media, adding it would be a \"historic challenge\" to return. He delivered a defiant warning to Venezuelan authorities if they attempt to detain him.\n\n\"If the regime dares, of course, to kidnap us, it will be the last mistake they make,\" he said.\n\nGuaido spoke to the camera in a room with his wife, Fabiana Rosales, beside him and a Venezuelan flag in the background.\n\n'Government overthrow'\n\nThe leader of the National Assembly who declared himself president also tweeted a photo of himself walking across an airfield before his departure from the naval base in Salinas, Ecuador, where he met Ecuadorian President Lenin Moreno on Saturday.\n\nGuaido said he was \"taking off\" but did not say where the plane was heading.\n\nIn Venezuela, anticipation grew before Guaido's expected arrival. Opposition activists circulated a call on social media for people to gather on Monday morning at the Alfredo Sadel plaza in Las Mercedes, a shopping and entertainment area in Caracas where protests have been held in the past.\n\nThe government, meanwhile, has urged Venezuelans to celebrate the Carnival season slated for Monday and Tuesday by travelling to beaches and other holiday spots. Many people don't have the resources for leisure trips and opposition supporters say the country should not celebrate in times of crisis.\n\nVenezuela's vice president, Delcy Rodriguez, did not directly address a question about whether Guaido faces arrest during an interview with Russian state-owned TV channel RT. But she left open the possibility saying Guaido had broken the law and was \"a Venezuelan who conspires with foreign governments to overthrow a constitutional government\".\n\nRodriguez spoke during a visit to Russia, which backs Maduro and has accused the United States of plotting his downfall.\n\nGuaido was in Ecuador as part of a tour of Latin American countries designed to increase pressure on Maduro to resign.\n\n'Firm condemnation'\n\nGuaido says Maduro's exit would allow Venezuela to emerge from its political and humanitarian crisis with international support.\n\nMaduro says Guaido is part of a US-backed plot against him and that a failed attempt by the opposition to bring aid into Venezuela from Brazil and Colombia last weekend was a political stunt.\n\nThe US and about 50 other countries recognise Guaido as Venezuela's president, arguing that Maduro's reelection last year was a sham.\n\nThe US warned Venezuela's leadership against harming the opposition figure.\n\n\"Any threats or acts against his safe return will be met a strong and significant response from the United States and the international community,\" said John Bolton, assistant to the president for national security affairs.\n\nVenezuelan Interim President Juan Guaido has announced his planned return to Venezuela.

    "title": "[Editorial] Venezuelans' right to health crumbles amid political crisis",
    "description": "The rising prosperity of Venezuela during the 20th century helped to consolidate gains in health outcomes made over decades. Now, a country rich in natural resources is submerged in a complex humanitarian emergency due to the politico-economic crisis that sta\u2026",
    "text": "The rising prosperity of Venezuela during the 20th century helped to consolidate gains in health outcomes made over decades. Now, a country rich in natural resources is submerged in a complex humanitarian emergency due to the politico-economic crisis that started in 2008, progressively destroying the health-care system.\n\nIn this issue, Page and colleagues discuss the current situation in Venezuela and explain how the crisis has threatened the nation's public health, resulting in increases in morbidity and mortality. The authors also report on the observations they made when visiting the Venezuelan borders with Colombia and Brazil, where the movement of Venezuelan migrants has already resulted in a strain on both countries' health-care systems. Another worrying implication of the movement of migrants into neighbouring countries is the quick dissemination of infectious diseases, such as malaria and Chagas. A Review in The Lancet Infectious Diseases analysed the return of vector-borne diseases and the implications for spillover in the region. For example, the number of malaria cases increased by 359% between 2000 and 2015, and by a further 71% in 2017 (411 586 cases). Dengue incidence increased by more than four times between 1990 and 2016. These epidemics are exacerbated by the decline in public health programmes, such as childhood immunisation, insufficient potable water, and poor sanitation conditions.\n\nIn 2018, 82% of people in Venezuela (about 28\u00b75 million people) and 75% of health centres around the country did not have a continuous supply of water, according to a report on the right to water published by five Venezuelan non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Running water is provided sporadically (in some areas this can be once every 20 days) and the water that does reach the population is of poor quality or not potable. To aggravate the situation, shortages of electricity have been recurrently reported over more than 3 months and have culminated in a widespread blackout between March 7 and March 11, leaving homes and hospitals in the dark. Failures in the electricity supply system were reported as causing the death of 79 patients between Nov 16, 2018, and Feb 9, 2019, in the 40 main hospitals of the country. These data are from a national survey , Encuesta Nacional de los Hospitales 2019 which also notes that 1557 patients died because of insufficient hospital supplies. The medical NGO that published these data explained that these are conservative estimates as many deaths are not reported.\n\nIn the meantime, hyperinflation (estimated by the International Monetary Fund to be at 10 million % in 2019) puts the cost of daily food out of reach for nine in ten Venezuelans, according to the ENCOVI (Living Conditions survey) 2017. The food crisis is further exacerbated by absence of food diversity and collapse of food infrastructure (production, distribution, and access to food). As a result, between 2016 and 2018, the proportion of the population that is undernourished increased from 5% to 12%, according to a report on the right to food published by three Venezuelan NGOs. Poor nutrition between conception and 2 years of age is threatening the physical, mental, and social development of new generations. Venezuela is the only country in Latin America showing a deterioration in child survival back to the levels of the 1990s. According to estimates in a recent study in The Lancet Global Health, the infant mortality rate reached 21\u00b71 deaths per 1000 livebirths in 2016, almost 40% higher than in 2008.\n\nVowing to improve the situation, on March 1, the UN security council voted on two resolutions related to Venezuela but failed to pass either of them because the USA, Russia, and China clashed over the issue. The USA recognises Juan Guaido, leader of the National Assembly, as the country's president, whereas China and Russia continue to recognise Nicol\u00e1s Maduro as leader of the country. While the divisive debate regarding last year's disputed presidential elections continues to rage, Venezuela is struggling with hunger and preventable diseases.\n\nAs we went to press, a UN team was visiting the country on an official human rights mission following a surprising invitation from Maduro, who has been reluctant to accept humanitarian aid. There is hope that Maduro will be transparent with the UN team and allow them to observe the true complexity of the situation. The UN human rights team is also scheduled to speak with members of Guaido's party. Whatever the outcome of the UN's mission, the urgent implementation of effective measures to facilitate the coordinated international response to the Venezuelans' plight cannot come soon enough. The right to health and to food cannot be politicised and the international community is failing if these universal rights are not restored in Venezuela.\n\n2019 see For the Encuesta Nacional de los Hospitalessee https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/0f3ae5_20a71632b12b4924bcee0e06e659361d.pdf\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2019 Luis Robayo/Getty Images",

    "text": "The economic crisis in Venezuela has eroded the country's health-care infrastructure and threatened the public health of its people. Shortages in medications, health supplies, interruptions of basic utilities at health-care facilities, and the emigration of health-care workers have led to a progressive decline in the operational capacity of health care. The effect of the crisis on public health has been difficult to quantify since the Venezuelan Ministry of Health stopped publishing crucial public health statistics in 2016. We prepared a synthesis of health information, beyond what is available from other sources, and scholarly discussion of engagement strategies for the international community. Data were identified through searches in MEDLINE, PubMed, and the grey literature, through references from relevant articles, and governmental and non-governmental reports, and publicly available databases. Articles published in English and Spanish until Dec 1, 2018, were included. Over the past decade, public health measures in Venezuela have substantially declined. From 2012 to 2016, infant deaths increased by 63% and maternal mortality more than doubled. Since 2016, outbreaks of the vaccine-preventable diseases measles and diphtheria have spread throughout the region. From 2016 to 2017, Venezuela had the largest rate of increase of malaria in the world, and in 2015, tuberculosis rates were the highest in the country in 40 years. Between 2017 and 2018, most patients who were infected with HIV interrupted therapy because of a lack of medications. The Venezuelan economic crisis has shattered the health-care system and resulted in rising morbidity and mortality. Outbreaks and expanding epidemics of infectious diseases associated with declines in basic public health services are threatening the health of the country and the region.\n\nThere is no apparent near-term resolution to Venezuela's economic crisis. The volatile political context further complicates the situation: President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro is unpopular, has gradually consolidated political power, and has implemented policies to repress political opposition.Under Maduro's Government, there have been systematic human rights abuses, including excessive use of force against protestors, arbitrary detention, torture, attacks and restrictions on democratic space, and violations of the universal rights to health and food.In regard to health, the government has refused to release epidemiological data required to assess the magnitude of the situation, its consequences, and how best to respond. During the first 3 months of 2018, there were 287 protests by patients and health professionals demanding better working conditions and access to treatments and medicines.When health-care workers or organisations have protested, attempted to discuss the situation or release health data, the government has responded with threats and sanctions, used force to repress protests, arrested doctors, and placed armed groups at hospitals to prevent the media and others from gathering evidence.As a result, more than 3\u00b74 million Venezuelan people have fled the county and are currently displaced in the region.Until last year, most of the humanitarian response funding was directed towards countries receiving Venezuelan migrants. In late 2018 the UN announced US$9\u00b72 million in health and nutrition aid for Venezuela, the first UN emergency funding for Venezuela, and an indication of government recognition of the crisis and the potential for scaling up the international humanitarian response. We summarise the available information on the health situation in Venezuela, with the aim of characterising needs and humanitarian response priorities. One of the most important limitations to this analysis is access to information\u2014there are little recent and reliable nationally representative data available, making it difficult to get an accurate picture of the status of the health systems and changes in key indicators of population health during the past several years.\n\nVenezuela was one of the most prosperous countries in South America in the late 20th century; however, the ongoing economic crisis has reversed these gains and threatens the nation's health and stability. After his election in 1998, Hugo Ch\u00e1vez enacted constitutional reforms that guaranteed free health care for all citizens and dramatically scaled up social programmes and subsidies for food and energy, which aimed to address severe societal inequalities. Social spending as a share of GDP increased from 28% to 40% between 2000 and 2013, and was funded largely by profits from petroleum exports, which accounts for more than 90% of exports and most of government revenue.The government borrowed against future oil exports and public debt rose from 28% to 58% of GDP from 2000 to 2012 while external financing became increasingly limited.Venezuela began reporting substantial budget deficits in 2006, averaging 3\u00b76% of GDP between 2006 and 2016, and the government announced plans to restructure debt in 2017.Several other factors contributed to the economic crisis, including price and currency controls, and reductions in private production and failure of expropriated enterprises, both of which resulted in production declines and increased dependency on imports.Shortages of basic goods began in 2014 and contributed to inflation, which began in 2013 and accelerated steeply in 2017, and is forecasted to exceed 1 000 000% in 2018 ( figure 1 ).Although the government has blamed the crisis on US sanctions, which have included exceptions to the purchase of food and medicines and focused on addressing corruption by key officials, economic deterioration preceded sanctions.\n\nSince 2012, Venezuela's health system has had a progressive loss of operational capacity that began to intensify in 2017.The health system decline, which is due to a combination of factors, including the shortage of medicines and basic health products, lack of utilities (eg, water), and emigration of health personnel, has affected access to health care and medication throughout the country as well as the capacity of emergency services and outbreak response.Findings from the 2018 Annual National Hospital Survey,which was done by a political opposition group and medical non-governmental organisation, included 137 hospitals in 22 states and showed a deterioration of services as compared with preceding years, and that basic services, such as laboratories, imaging, and pharmacies, are not regularly available in many hospitals. 94% of radiology services and 100% of laboratory testing were intermittently functioning or non-functional, and over half of the wards (in 53% of hospitals) and hospital beds (in 40% of hospitals) were not consistently available for patient care; 20% of operating rooms and intensive care units were completely non-functional. Most hospitals reported shortages in water (79%), medications (88%), and surgical supplies (79%).Patients are asked to provide their own basic medical supplies, such as syringes and scalpels, and insufficient provision of food in hospitals requires their families to provide meals during hospital stays. Inflation and lack of availability of medicines has led to the creation of a black market and many people still cannot afford purchase costs.These conditions are decimating the health-care workforce in Venezuela. Even before the height of the crisis, it was estimated that a third of registered physicians (22 000/66 138 in the country in 2014) had left Venezuela.Emigration of doctors has affected the specialties of neonatology, anaesthesiology, intensive care, and emergency care the most. Migration of other health professionals, including nurses, laboratory technicians, and others also negatively affects health system capacity. A national survey in May 2018, of 1469 physicians found that 1432 (98%) strongly agreed the health-care crisis was the worst in 30 years; 1403 (96%) reported inadequate salaries; and 1056 (72%) strongly agreed that the working conditions in public hospitals violated physician ethics and human rights.\n\nSurveillance data obtained from Hospital Ra\u00fal Leoni Otero (Bol\u00edvar, Venezuela) highlight the health crisis. Infant mortality at the hospital more than doubled since 2016. Neonatal mortality increased by 54% between 2016 and 2018 (29\u00b74 vs 45\u00b74 deaths per 1000 births) and infant mortality more than doubled (36\u00b72 vs 78\u00b77 deaths per 1000 births, based on surveillance data for Jan 1 to April 15, 2018, compared with all of 2016 [Hospital Ra\u00fal Leoni Otero, unpublished]). Between 2016 and 2017, admissions for malaria rose by 71% and for diarrhoea by 27%, and the hospital treated more cases of measles and diphtheria in 2017 than it did in 2016 related to the national outbreaks. Dramatic increases in case fatality ratios (CFRs) for diarrhoea (1\u00b71% in 2016 vs 6\u00b79% in 2018), malaria (1\u00b76% in 2016 vs 8\u00b76% in 2018) and other conditions are the result of the hospital's struggle to maintain operation in the face of blackouts, intermittent water services, and severe shortages of medications and medical supplies.\n\nThe latest official data published by the Venezuelan Ministry of Health on maternal and child mortality was in 2016. Since then, there has been no official reporting but the trends observed at the time were alarming. Between 2015 and 2016, infant deaths increased by 30\u00b71% and maternal deaths by 65\u00b74% ( figure 2 ). Infants deaths were 63\u00b76% higher in 2016 than they were in 2012, and maternal deaths more than doubled in that period ( figure 2 UNICEF data also indicate an increase in infant mortality rates; in 2012 the infant mortality rate was 14\u00b76 per 1000 livebirths, compared with 25\u00b77 per 1000 livebirths in 2017.A demographic analysisusing multiple sources of national data found that infant mortality rates began increasing in 2009, with the greatest rise after 2011. The 2016 infant mortality rate was estimated to be 21\u00b71 deaths per 1000 livebirths\u2014similar to levels observed in the late 1990s.By contrast with other countries in the region, which have had slow but consistent declines in mortality in the past two decades,the population mortality rate for Venezuela increased from 450 per 100 000 in 2004 to 537 per 100 000 in 2014.National mortality data have not been publicly available since 2014, but the health systems collapse, ongoing infectious disease outbreaks, and declines in maternal and child nutrition status suggest that the situation is dire.\n\nThe collapse of the public health infrastructure in Venezuela is most obvious in the resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases ( figure 3 ). Ongoing outbreaks of diphtheria began in 2016 and measles in 2017. Since the beginning of the diphtheria outbreak in July 2016, to January 2019, there were 2512 suspected cases (1559 confirmed cases) and 270 deaths; the CFR among confirmed cases was 18% in 2016, 13% in 2017, and 20% in 2018. The outbreak encompasses all states and the Capital District, with cases in all age groups, although the highest incidence rate is in children younger than 15 years.The first measles cases were confirmed in June 2017, and by January 2019, 9101 cases had been reported in Venezula (6395 confirmed cases) including 76 deaths; the national incidence rate was estimated at 17\u00b78 per 100 000.Transmission is ongoing in all states and the Capital District and is highest in the states of Delta Amacuro and Amazonas and the Capital District. Indigenous populations are especially susceptible, with 499 confirmed cases and 64 deaths.Between 2017 and 2018, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) provided nearly 7 million doses of measles vaccines and 9 million doses of diphtheria vaccines in Venezuela. In mid-2018, the Venezuelan Government announced vaccination campaigns that were planned to target 9 million people, including 4 million measles and rubella vaccinations and 2\u00b73 million diphtheria vaccinations for children.Despite these efforts, the Venezuela measles outbreak spread to neighbouring countries in the region, with cases reported in Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, and Argentina. In 2016, and 2017, only four confirmed measles cases were reported in these five countries, whereas until January 2019, the confirmed case count soared to 10 557 ( figure 4 ), mostly concentrated in Brazil. Nearly all measles cases shared the genotype of the virus that was identified in Venezuela in 2017.In Colombia, nearly all the cases occurred in people who had travelled to Venezuela.\n\nMalaria rates have been increasing in Venezuela since 2012 and have soared in the past several years ( figure 5 ).From 2016 to 2017, Venezuela had the largest rate of increase of malaria in the world (69%) with 414 527 cases in 2017 alone.Malaria is epidemic in nine states, and transmission in urban areas; a particularly dramatic increase has been documented in Anzo\u00e1tegui State, where the number of malaria cases increased by 1341% between 2016 and 2017.Several factors have contributed to the spread of malaria, which is most commonly caused by Plasmodium vivax (77%) and Plasmodium falciparum (17%).In the most severely affected states of Bolivar and Amazonas, illegal and unregulated mining activities have resulted in the formation of standing bodies of water that serve as mosquito breeding grounds.The reduction of vector control activities and distribution of insecticide-treated bed nets have further exacerbated transmission.Additionally, medication shortages have reduced treatment access and led to the creation of a black market for antimalarials, which are unaffordable for many people. Exceedingly high slide positivity rates (59% in Bolivar and 44% in Amazonas) in 2018 highlight diagnostic delays and have resulted in an increase of almost nine times in CFRs from 2013 to 2017 (0\u00b78% vs 6\u00b77%), with 406 deaths from malaria in 2017.Similar to vaccine-preventable diseases, Venezuela's malaria epidemic has crossed international borders, with refugees and migrants with malaria often arriving in Brazil and other parts of Latin America, leading to an increase in malaria cases in other countries in the region.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2017, tuberculosis cases increased by almost 68% (6063 cases vs 10 185) and cases of multidrug resistant (MDR) tuberculosis doubled (39 vs 79 cases); the 2017 tuberculosis incidence rate (32\u00b74 per 100 000) was the highest in Venezuela in 40 years.Several factors have contributed to setbacks in tuberculosis control, including a reduction in assessments for tuberculosis among people with respiratory symptoms due to the general decline of the health system, and more specifically, interruptions to the water supply, that compromise biosafety procedures; scarcity of reagents for GeneXpert testing; poor culture capabilities due to a lack of eggs; and inadequate transportation systems for patient samples.Although shortages in first-line and second-line medications for tuberculosis have not been officially reported, physicians working in Venezuela indicate that access to treatment in regional health centres is poor, and patients need to travel to large urban centres for treatment.\n\nAdditionally, there are widespread shortages of basic contraception. Condoms, birth control pills, and intrauterine devices have not been available at public hospitals since 2015.Pharmacy shortages have led to the creation of a contraception black market, in which a month supply of birth control pills, for example, costs 14 times the minimum monthly income.Venezuela had among the highest teenage pregnancy rates in Latin America before the economic collapse, and maternal mortality in 2015 was 40% higher than the regional average.According to the director of Asociacion Civil de Planificacion Familiar, Venezuela's largest network of family planning clinics, the number of patients presenting with complications from clandestine abortions has increased, as has the number of women seeking permanent sterilisation.\n\nThe latest available epidemiologic data on HIV reported by the Venezuelan Ministry of Health is from 2016, when there were an estimated 120 000 people infected with HIV in Venezuela.Since 2010, new HIV diagnoses have increased by 24%, with 6500 new diagnoses in 2016, although this figure might be low because of a shortage of diagnostic tests for suspected cases.Delayed diagnosis and poor clinical management are increasing, with 70% of new patients diagnosed with AIDS in 2016, compared with 53% in 2012.In 2016, 59% of HIV-infected patients had access to antiretroviral therapy (ART), but only 7% were virologically suppressed; less than half (48%) of pregnant women who were HIV positive had access to ART or prophylaxis to prevent mother-to-child transmission.The HIV mortality rate was 38% higher in 2015 (8\u00b703 per 100 000) than it was a decade earlier (5\u00b780 per 100 000 in 2006).More recent mortality estimates are unavailable, but since 2015, the situation has worsened because of major gaps in diagnostic and treatment capabilities.Crucial laboratory tests for monitoring HIV-infected patients (CD4 cell count and viral load) have been unavailable since late 2017, and there are no reagents to use to do confirmatory tests for HIV diagnoses. None of the 339 blood banks in institutions associated with the national health system have reagents to test blood products, and HIV testing among neonatal exposures has declined by 50% since 2014. Ongoing ART shortages have led to treatment interruptions, which increase the risk of drug resistance. Testing for drug resistance has been unavailable since 2016.Of the 79 467 patients with HIV registered to receive antiretroviral treatment, PAHO estimates that 69 308 (87%) are not receiving it, although the actual numbers are difficult to calculate because of a lack of testing, high mortality, and the probability that some patients have emigrated to receive treatment. 15 of 25 antiretroviral medications purchased by the government have been unavailable for more than 9 months and medications to treat opportunistic infections and coinfections are seldom available.ART disruptions and limitations to access compromise treatment effectiveness, enhance the potential for the development of drug resistance, and increase the risk of onward HIV transmission, all of which are important public health concerns.\n\nAddressing Venezuela's public health crisis and its spread in the region\n\n32 PAHO WHO Epidemiological update: measles. 9 UN Refugee Agency International Organization for Migration Number of Refugees, Migrants from Venezuela Reaches 3 Million. 33 United Nations Central Emergency Fund Response 2018 allocations by country. Panel The health needs of Venezuelan people at the Colombian and Brazilian borders 31 US Agency for International Development Venezuela regional crisis fact sheet #4 (FY2018). In July and August, 2018, we visited communities along the Brazil\u2013Colombia border to assess public health issues related to the massive exodus of Venezuelans. We did observational and qualitative assessments, through interviewing key informants and reviewing available data from surveillance systems and health facilities. Despite notable differences between the Venezuelan borders with Colombia and Brazil, the strain on the health-care system was evident in both countries. Colombia has received the largest number of migrants by far, estimated at more than 1\u00b71 million people as of mid-2018.In addition to Venezuelans intending to stay in Colombia, there are many people that cross the border on a day trip from Colombia to engage in commerce or eat at soup kitchens, while others are in transit to other countries, primarily Peru and Ecuador. Colombian people, who fled to Venezuela to escape Colombia's internal conflict, and are now returning with hopes of improving their situation. Families go to Cucuta, Colombia (on the Venezuelan border) to receive vaccinations that are unavailable in Venezuela, to seek prenatal care and give birth, and to purchase medicines and seek medical services that are no longer accessible in Venezuela. The emergency department in Cucuta's tertiary hospital struggles to cope with the number of patients, and is incurring large debt as it struggles to provide life-saving care. Health services for conditions that are not life-threatening are only available for a fee at Colombia's health facilities\u2014meaning that treatment for many common illnesses and more complex health conditions is out of reach for most Venezuelan people in Colombia. Although fewer Venezuelan people have arrived in Brazil (58 850 as of July, 2018), the geographic isolation and poor economic opportunities in the receiving state of Roraima amplifies the negative effect on refugees and migrants. The public health system is under pressure to contain a rapidly expanding measles outbreak that originated in Venezuela and to address other public health priorities, such as the increasing demand for health services and maintaining adequate vaccination coverage levels. In the first 6 months of 2018, there were more cases of tuberculosis among Venezuelan people than there were from 2013 to 2017; the number of Venezuelan patients infected with HIV receiving care at the outpatient clinic tripled; malaria cases doubled compared with the same period in 2017; and health-care use among Venezuelan people expanded so quickly that hospitals in the region are experiencing unprecedented shortages of antibiotics and basic medical supplies. Visits to hospitals in the border areas of Colombia and Brazil highlight the dire situation in Venezuela. In Brazil, the HIV and oncology wards were at capacity treating Venezuelan refugees and migrants with advanced, and in some cases end-stage, disease who had not received appropriate therapy in Venezuela. The neonatal intensive care unit had run out of incubators because of increased demand from Venezuelan women who arrived late in pregnancy, often malnourished and without any previous prenatal care. There is clear and compelling evidence that the Venezuelan public health crisis has become a regional health threat ( panel ). Estimating the excess mortality associated with the crisis in Venezuela is difficult given the suppression of health data. Indigenous populations are particularly at risk, accounting for almost 90% of all measles-associated deaths in Venezuela during the current outbreak, which began in 2017.Neighbouring countries are under strain to contain infectious disease outbreaks and to respond to the massive exodus of Venezuelan people seeking food, protection, and health care.Given the large scale migration of Venezuelan people from their troubled homeland, these transnational public health issues are not unexpected, but they do lend urgency to the need for regional responses to Venezuela's crisis. Efforts to provide humanitarian relief have been complicated by the government's reluctance to acknowledge the extent of the crisis, although President Maduro's request for UN assistance might signal a welcome change.\n\n34 Daniels JP Acci\u00f3n Solidaria: propping up HIV treatment in Venezuela. 33 United Nations Central Emergency Fund Response 2018 allocations by country. Civil society organisations have played a crucial role advocating for change, facilitating logistics for the distribution of medications and other supplies, and supporting susceptible populations. As regards HIV, for example, partnerships between non-profit organisations such as AID for AIDS, activists, and private pharmaceutical companies have been instrumental in informing PAHO's strategy and have helped meet gaps in ART coverage.In late 2018, following pressure from various advocacy groups, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria agreed to donate US$5 million to PAHO for the purchase of medications and testing supplies, and the UN approved US$9\u00b72 million in emergency funding.These important steps led to exceptional funding for an upper middle-income country in crisis that is normally ineligible to receive such funds and established mechanisms for purchasing generically priced medications, and distributing and monitoring aid. These changes will hopefully encourage other donors to finance the purchase of much needed supplies and medicines. However, increasing the availability of medicines and medical supplies alone will not address the complex and long-term issues of a decaying infrastructure with insufficient functionality and the exodus of health professionals. These realities will probably cripple Venezuela's health system for decades and require long term strategies to scale up training programmes and promote retention of the health-care workforce.\n\nIn the short term, several steps are needed to reduce the health toll of the crisis. First, the government must facilitate a coordinated humanitarian response, with engagement of international workers to address priority health issues. Second, as part of the health response, the government must accept more assistance from international donors, PAHO, and other health organisations to restore public health infrastructure and medical supply chains and improve disease surveillance. Third, because infants and children are especially susceptible groups, efforts to improve immunisation coverage must be sustained and expanded within Venezuela and bordering areas, in particular for measles, given the scale of the ongoing outbreak. Fourth, the international donor community, including the Global Fund, the World Bank and humanitarian donors, should be encouraged to continue and expand efforts to support prevention, treatment, and health care for Venezuelan people, in Venezuela and in countries hosting large numbers of Venezuelan migrants. These organisations might need to take a fundamental role in the oversight of the distribution of aid to guarantee that it reaches those who need it because of fears of corruption. Venezuela was once among the most prosperous countries in South America\u2014now is the time for collective acknowledgment of the crisis and a coordinated humanitarian response that avoids further unnecessary suffering and stabilises population health.",

    "description": "The twin presidents of the United States and Brazil are linked most closely by the insecure, tough-guy grievance politics that fuel them both.",
    "text": "HuffPost Brasil \"Brazil\u2019s relationship with the United States, because of our friendship, is probably better than it\u2019s ever been,\" President Donald Trump (right) said during a meeting with Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro at the White House on Tuesday.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2015 Late Tuesday night, far-right Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro and his staff departed the Blair House, the estate that hosts foreign dignitaries and heads of state on their visits to the United States, en route to Andrews Air Force Base and a long flight south.\n\nIn the rearview mirror, Bolsonaro had left a new best friend.\n\nEarlier in the day, Bolsonaro met with President Donald Trump at the White House, for talks that covered everything from their approach to the crisis in Venezuela to U.S. desires to launch satellites in Brazil. But the meetings, more than anything else, turned into a love fest between the leader known as \u201cBrazil\u2019s Trump\u201d and the real thing.\n\nFinally together in person, the men in charge of two of the world\u2019s four largest democracies spent most of Tuesday afternoon showering each other with the kind of doting praise that has become a regular feature of Trump\u2019s time with foreign leaders who share his authoritarian impulses.\n\n\u201cHe has done a very outstanding job \u2015 ran one of the incredible campaigns,\u201d Trump said with Bolsonaro by his side. \u201cI think Brazil\u2019s relationship with the United States, because of our friendship, is probably better than it\u2019s ever been by far.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have always admired the United States of America,\u201d Bolsonaro said an hour later, at a joint news conference in the Rose Garden, his eyes wandering to his left, where Trump was standing. \u201cAnd this sense of admiration has increased since you took office.\u201d\n\nBolsonaro and Trump have many things in common \u2015 they are anti-immigrant and anti-LGBTQ, they share a history of making deeply racist and sexist remarks, and neither can quite hide their disdain for the basic tenets of democracy as they rail against \u201cfake news,\u201d praise authoritarian leaders and, in Bolsonaro\u2019s case, openly pine for the return of military rule to Brazil.\n\nWhat connects it all, though, and what has fostered the sort of bromance that took root last year and fully bloomed this week in Washington, is the sense of masculine, tough-guy aggrievement that fuels them both \u2015 the defiant but insecure machismo that flows through everything they do.\n\nIt was on full display throughout Bolsonaro\u2019s time in Washington.\n\n\u201cMay I say that Brazil and the United States stand side-by-side in their efforts to ensure liberties and traditional family lifestyles and God, our creator,\u201d Bolsonaro said during the White House press conference.\n\n\u201cAnd against gender ideology or politically correct attitudes,\u201d he added, jamming his deep-rooted opposition to efforts to promote equality for women and LGBTQ people into one of the biggest moments of his visit.\n\nTrump, who once proclaimed himself \u201ca real friend\u201d to the LGBTQ community, didn\u2019t bat an eye. Instead, he praised Bolsonaro for lumping a distaste for \u201cfake news\u201d into the group of things both countries detest.\n\nThat both Trump and Bolsonaro are thrice married apparently does not contradict their version of what constitutes \u201ctraditional family lifestyles\u201d \u2015 instead it seems to reinforce it. In an impromptu press gathering after the White House visit had concluded, Bolsonaro told reporters that he and Trump had joked about the relatively young ages of their current wives (first lady Melania Trump is nearly 25 years younger than her husband; Jair Bolsonaro is 30 years older than his wife Michelle).\n\n\u201cI called him a young man and I spoke to a translator \u2015 careful what you\u2019re going to say now \u2015 why I\u2019m calling him a young man: We\u2019re the age of the woman we love,\u201d Bolsonaro said.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t his first effort at humor of the week.\n\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images \"I have always admired the United States of America, and this sense of admiration has increased since you took office,\" Bolsonaro told Trump during a White House visit on Tuesday.\n\nDuring a Monday speech at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Bolsonaro told the American business community that his initial meeting with his economic minister, the University of Chicago-trained economist Paulo Guedes, resulted in \u201clove at first sight.\u201d\n\n\u201cEconomically, I mean,\u201d Bolsonaro cracked, drawing laughter from the crowd.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a homophobe, by the way,\u201d Bolsonaro, who has said he would rather have a dead son than a gay one, added. He later insisted the same during an interview on Fox News, adding there that he is not racist or xenophobic, either.\n\nGuedes got in on the act, too: The reason Brazil is suffering from high rates of violence and a sluggish economy, he said at the Chamber event, is that \u201cnobody had balls\u201d enough to fix the problems.\n\n\u201cSo, we got a guy who has balls,\u201d Guedes said. (When it comes to violence, Bolsonaro\u2019s main balls-informed plan has been to give one of the world\u2019s deadliest police forces even more power to kill on sight.)\n\nThat tough-guy image is central to both Bolsonaro and Trump\u2019s appeal \u2015 to each other and their most hardcore supporters.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign and subsequent presidency have been defined by his appeals to aggrieved white men who feel like their America has been taken from them by immigrants, black people, LGBTQ communities, women and the political leaders who seek to advance the rights of all of them.\n\nBolsonaro, meanwhile, ran for office promising to restore Brazil \u201cfor the Brazilians\u201d \u2015 by which he primarily meant those Brazilians who felt their own grip on their Brazil had been loosened by years of leftist governments that pushed affirmative action quotas and other policies aimed at improving life for some of Brazil\u2019s most marginalized peoples. (\u201cBolsonaro\u2019s campaign slogan could well be \u2018It\u2019s not your fault,\u2019\u201d Harvard professor Bruno Carvalho wrote last July. \u201cAs if to say, \u2019If they weren\u2019t ruining everything, this country would be great.\u2019\u201d)\n\nThat\u2019s not just conjecture: Researchers found in 2016 that the more people believed in \u201cmasculine honor beliefs\u201d \u2015 supporting male aggression, physicality and bravery \u2015 \u201cthe more positive they felt about Trump.\u201d Others have suggested that Trump support rose in areas that showed higher levels of \u201cfragile masculinity.\u201d\n\nThe appeal of figures like Trump and Bolsonaro as mythical, comically masculine figures is evident in the sort of artwork and memes that each has inspired, and that circulated again around their meeting. In them, they are painted as muscle-bound, G.I. Joe-like superheroes, ready to save the world from the perceived scourge of LGBTQ people, feminism, immigrants and the \u201cpolitical correctness\u201d that has eroded the world in which men can just be men.\n\nWhat's so funny about this sort of right-wing meme is the suspension of belief its propagators have to have about the bodies of their leaders pic.twitter.com/jwJbdPtglE \u2014 Ishaan Tharoor (@ishaantharoor) March 19, 2019\n\nComic relief aside, that machismo has directly informed the way Trump and Bolsonaro have governed.\n\nBoth have stacked their governments with military officials that project the sort of strong, honorable image neither Bolsonaro nor Trump is capable of pulling off themselves. Bolsonaro\u2019s 23-member cabinet includes just two women, and one of them \u2015 Minister of Human Rights, Family and Women Damares Alves \u2015 has embraced Bolsonaro\u2019s fight against \u201cgender ideology\u201d with a rigid traditionalism: \u201cAttention, attention! It\u2019s a new era in Brazil: Boys wear blue and girls wear pink!\u201d Alves tweeted in January.\n\nTrump has routinely targeted women and minority groups not just with rhetoric but with policy decisions too, and Bolsonaro has followed a similar path. His first actions as president were aimed at reducing rights and protections for LGBTQ people, black Brazilians and indigenous communities, all of which are already subject to high rates of violence across Brazil.\n\nGovernment-by-machismo also tends to lead to more hardline policies, and more aggressive support for them, when it comes to public security and foreign policy. In Brazil, Bolsonaro has supported shoot-to-kill policing in order to address violence, while Trump\u2019s approaches to immigration and, right now, his efforts to oust Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro \u2015 potentially with military force \u2015 give off the same tough-man vibe both leaders try so hard to project. (During his visit, Bolsonaro said he supported Trump\u2019s border wall with Mexico and criticized immigrants; he also refused to take military support for the U.S. in Venezuela off the table.)\n\nTrump and Bolsonaro\u2019s meeting came at an important time for each, with both of the leaders in need of each other\u2019s validation. Their governments are both flailing thanks to allegations of corruption, and their approval ratings and confidence in them to lead their respective countries have plummeted \u2015 in Trump\u2019s case to near its lowest point and in Bolsonaro\u2019s from the heights he enjoyed the day he took office just two months ago.\n\nBut their bromance was comforting, a chance to look in the mirror and see a version of themselves in a position of power elsewhere. People in both countries have feared that the sort of validation Trump and Bolsonaro derive from each other could only lead to even more backlash against their most marginalized communities.\n\n\u201cWhen we see two far-right, neo-fascist people like Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro meeting, we know it can only signal something bad for the oppressed people of their respective nations,\u201d Sean Blackmon, a D.C.-based activist, said after a Sunday afternoon protest outside the White House, where nearly 100 people demonstrated against Bolsonaro\u2019s visit.\n\nTrump\u2019s aggressive macho politics have helped amplify fringe \u201cmen\u2019s rights movements\u201d and emboldened white nationalists in the U.S. and elsewhere, with deadly consequences. Brazil is already one of the deadliest countries in the world for LGBTQ people, black people, and women \u2015 in 2019 so far, four women a day have died due to femicide \u2015 and there are fears across those communities that Bolsonaro\u2019s brand of politics will only make it worse.\n\n\u201cThese are two people who are both racist, sexist, bigoted against the LGBTQ community, and who support police terror,\u201d Blackmon said. \u201cWe may even see an intensification of oppression. This kind of tacit seal of approval from the United States has a lot of meaning across the world. When we see Donald Trump basically giving his seal of approval to Bolsonaro, it\u2019s a signal to him that nothing is going to stop him.\u201d\n\nTrump and Bolsonaro\u2019s machismo has made them friends \u2015 at least in the context of their presidencies. But the consequences of their approach to politics and the friendship it has fostered will likely linger well after both leave office.",

    "text": "Cucuta, Colombia - Cielo leaves her home in Venezuela at 04:30am every day to get to school in Colombia.\n\nFor two years now, the 11-year-old student has been crossing into Colombia using the Simon Bolivar footbridge for access to education as many teachers in her homeland have migrated or refuse to work for the little money the Venezuelan government can pay them since the country's economic crisis began in 2015.\n\nBut this bridge, along with others, was blocked off last month for two weeks by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro after Juan Guaido, the opposition leader and self-declared interim president, attempted to lead a US-backed aid caravan across the border.\n\nMaduro, who has routinely denied that there is a humanitarian crisis in the country, maintains the aid is a ruse to remove him from power.\n\n190123205835912\n\nAfter days of protests by parents and children on the Venezuelan side of the border, a \"humanitarian passage\" was opened on Monday, allowing only schoolchildren and the critically ill to cross into Colombia using the formal border bridges.\n\nThis border closure led to an emergence of informal crossings, known locally as \"trochas\", that are dangerous and controlled by armed groups from both countries charging people money to pass through them. Venezuelans need to cross into Colombia to buy basic items that are scarce in Venezuela, like food and medicine, or, in Cielo's case, to get an education.\n\nEven though the bridge is now open for certain groups, the Venezuelan National Guard does not let parents cross with their children, who must go alone. People are also not allowed to transport products from Colombia into Venezuela on the bridges.\n\n\"I still use the trochas, because my mum has a disability and I need to get food in Colombia,\" Cielo said on Wednesday. \"The soldiers don't let you pass with anything, so I have to keep using the trochas to get it home.\"\n\nThe young student, whose favourite subject is biology, and sport enthusiast said she did not like using the trochas, but more importantly for her, she did not want to miss school.\n\n\"Sometimes, we have to run to get through [the trochas] because they close them off,\" Cielo said, walking her way to the crossing through the bustling border town of Cucuta after school, dressed in her school uniform.\n\n\"It's very dangerous. People say there are paramilitaries and guerrillas and sometimes there are confrontations.\"\n\nHeavy bags, smuggled goods and bribes\n\nUpon arrival to the narrow and overcrowded trocha, Cielo weaved her small body through the masses of people frantically trying to return to Venezuela, hauling heavy bags and suitcases filled with supplies bought in Colombia.\n\nPeople shout \"make way\" as they rush through with entire sacks of potatoes on their heads, while others get knocked down or to the side.\n\nChildren as young as eight stand by the river, asking for money in exchange for helping people cross it with their bags. On the other side, Venezuelan armed groups collect money to allow people to continue to use the trocha.\n\nOne mother, Dayanera Diaz, 42, takes turns with her sister each day to walk their children to school from Venezuela to Colombia. She was doing the return journey with her son and nephew a week ago. She said she had to pay to pass through, but they did not charge the children.\n\n\"When the bridge is open they go to school by themselves, but now that it's closed, it's too dangerous,\" said Diaz, who was also carrying rice and meat back with her.\n\nLaidy Gomez, the governor of the Tachira border region, deemed the measure of not letting Venezuelans through the border bridges with basic food and supplies for their families \"inhumane\". On Tuesday, members of the opposition asked Michelle Bachelet, the United Nations high commissioner for human rights, to visit the informal crossings.\n\nCielo attends the \"mega school\" on the border with about 2,500 other students. Nearly half - 1,200 - are Venezuelans or \"returning\" Colombians, who left during Colombia's five-decade-long armed conflict and have now come back since Venezuela's economic downfall.\n\n190314175747259\n\n\"It's unbelievable that only five out of 1,200 children came to class the day after the closure, who used to pass by without problems,\" said German Berbesi, the school's headteacher. \"For some, it was out of fear of the illegal armed groups, and for others, because the Venezuelan National Guard or the guerillas and paramilitary groups didn't let them cross\".\n\nBerbesi criticised the governments of the United States and Colombia, as well as Venezuela's opposition, for disappearing after their \"failed attempt\" to get aid into Venezuela.\n\n\"Now the borders are closed and our children are left stranded, where is our president, our governors, our mayor? Where is [US] President [Donald] Trump's help now?\" he said.\n\nThe headteacher said attendance numbers have gone down dramatically since the border closed and now there are about 850 of the 1,200 Venezuelans or \"returning\" Colombians attending. Before, most of these students would hardly miss a day as spots in the school are in high demand.\n\n\"In the trochas, the children are always at risk. Parents call to say they aren't sending their child because they're scared for them. What can I say? I can't force them to send them in case something happens to them,\" Berbesi said.\n\n'Huge' human rights violation\n\nOne of the main reasons for the reopening of the bridge for children and the sick was because the river they had to cross has risen in recent days due to rainfall, making the trek even more difficult.\n\n\"I have a friend who's missed two weeks and I know others who are coming up to three weeks,\" said Cielo.\n\n190305174925049\n\nThe Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) - a group devoted to protecting the rights of people affected by displacement - said some 4,000 boys and girls who cross the border every day to get an education in Colombia have not been able to continue with their classes because of the border closure.\n\n\"In spite of the situation, some children are walking through irregular crossings to reach schools, exposing themselves to the protection risks, including those associated with non-state armed groups that are part of the conflict in Colombia,\" Christian Visnes, NRC Colombia country director, told Al Jazeera.\n\nPeople squeeze through this trocha in Cucuta with heavy bags of food they can\u2019t get in \ud83c\uddfb\ud83c\uddea. These trochas are dangerous, controlled by armed groups who charge money. Before people crossed border bridges, but they\u2019ve been closed since Feb 23 due to disputes over humanitarian aid. pic.twitter.com/iv6RnwF517 \u2014 Steven Grattan (@sjgrattan) March 7, 2019\n\nVenezuela's closure of the border has mainly affected its own people, according to Felipe Munoz, the Colombian government's director of border issues.\n\n\"There are 3,218 Venezuelan children who are collected in Colombian buses every day and brought to school so they can study and eat and that is not able to happen now,\" Munoz said, referring mainly to children who live in further away towns.\n\n\"This is a huge violation of the most basic human rights.\"\n\nCielo said she would continue to make her daunting walk to school through the trochas for now, but hoped for change.\n\n\"The time I leave in the morning it's really dark and feels dangerous. It's all bushes and sometimes when I get there, they haven't even opened the trochas yet,\" the 11-year-old said.\n\n\"I'm getting used to it, but I hope things get back to normal soon.\"",

    "text": "NEW YORK: Oil fell about 2 percent on Friday, slipping further from 2019 highs as focus shifted to a lack of progress in U.S.-China trade talks and as grim manufacturing data from Germany and the U.S. reignited fears of a slowdown in the global economy and oil demand.The pan-European STOXX 600 index slipped for a third day after the flash PMI survey of purchasing managers showed German manufacturing contracted further in March, registering its lowest reading since June 2013. In the U.S., PMI manufacturing data missed estimates. Brent crude futures were at $66.58 per barrel at 11:07 a.m. ET (1507 GMT), $1.28, or 1.9 percent below their last close and down about 0.8 percent on the week. The contract hit a four-month high of $68.69 on Thursday.The global benchmark has risen by more than 20 percent since the beginning of January, due to supply cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, such as Russia, and U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures were down $1.48, or 2.5 percent, at $58.50 per barrel. WTI marked a 2019 peak on Thursday at $60.39 and is set for a third consecutive week of gains, rising by about 0.1 percent on the week.\"Today's disappointing PMI data out of Germany and France spurred further dollar gains while, at the same time, compressing global risk appetite,\" said Jim Ritterbusch, president of Ritterbusch and Associates.The U.S. dollar climbed against the euro on Friday to its highest in more than a week. A strong dollar makes oil more expensive for holders of other currencies.\"The fact that these macro factors are able to offset the price impact of an exceptional bullish EIA report attests to the fragility of this three month bull move in oil.\"The U.S. government's Energy Information Administration data showed that stockpiles last week fell by nearly 10 million barrels, the most since July, thanks to strong export and refining demand.As economic growth has slowed across Asia, Europe and North America, potentially denting fuel consumption, no breakthrough has emerged in the trade stand-off between Washington and Beijing, at least before meetings scheduled on March 28-29.Trade negotiations with China were progressing and a final agreement \"will probably happen,\" U.S. President Donald Trump said in a television interview aired on Friday.Three in four Japanese companies expect U.S.-China trade frictions to last until at least late this year, a Reuters poll found.A jump of more than 2 million barrels per day in U.S. crude oil production since early 2018 to a record 12.1 million bpd has made the United States the world's biggest producer, ahead of Russia and Saudi Arabia.This has resulted in increasing exports, which have doubled over the past year to more than 3 million bpd. The International Energy Agency estimated that the United States would become a net crude oil exporter by 2021.U.S. energy firms last week reduced the number of oil rigs operating for a fourth week in a row, with drilling slowing to its lowest in nearly a year, energy services firm Baker Hughes said. Data for this week is due at 1 p.m.",

    "description": "Venezuela\u2019s worst-ever power outage Friday raised tensions in a country already on edge from ongoing political turmoil.",
    "text": "March 8, 2019, 8:28 PM GMT By Associated Press\n\nCARACAS, Venezuela \u2014 Hospitals struggled to get back-up generators running, businesses shuttered and families anxiously tried to contact loved ones amid Venezuela's worst-ever power outage Friday, raising tensions in a country already on edge from ongoing political turmoil.\n\nMuch of the nation of 31 million people was still without electricity as the blackout stretched into a second day and patience began to wear thin.\n\n\"This has never happened before,\" a frustrated Orlando Roa, 54, said, decrying President Nicolas Maduro's administration for failing to maintain the electrical system and letting qualified engineers leave the country. \"This is the fault of the government.\"\n\nThe blackout was reported to have hit 22 of 23 states, striking during the peak of evening rush hour Thursday, sending thousands of people on long nighttime treks home through some of the world's most violent streets. Maduro ordered schools and all government entities closed and told businesses not to open to facilitate work crews trying to restore power.\n\nBy early Friday afternoon, residents and pro-government state broadcaster VTV reported that power was starting to return to parts of Caracas. The stoplights in several neighborhoods were back on while in one office building the electricity flickered to life and then turned off.\n\nVenezuela's socialist government blamed the power failure on right-wing extremists taking orders from the United States, including Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, and said they were intent on causing pandemonium for several days but offered no proof.\n\nMothers and relatives wait outside of a clinic for babies during a power outage in Caracas on March 7, 2019. Ariana Cubillos / AP\n\n\"The electricity war declared and directed by the imperialist United States against our people will be overcome!\" President Nicolas Maduro wrote on Twitter in his few public remarks on the outage. \"No one can defeat the people of Bolivar and Chavez. Maximum unity patriots!\"\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo shot back saying only Maduro was to blame.\n\n\"Maduro's policies bring nothing but darkness,\" Pompeo wrote on social media. \"No food. No medicine. Now, no power. Next, no Maduro.\"\n\nThe outage comes as Venezuela is in the throes of a political struggle between Maduro and opposition leader Juan Guaido, the head of congress who declared himself the nation's rightful president in January and is recognized by the United States and about 50 other nations.\n\nWithout power to charge cell phones, normally hyper-active social media was eerily quiet. Those who managed to get a signal used the hashtag #SinLuz \u2014 meaning without light in English \u2014 to share images of cities throughout the country that on Friday resembled ghost towns.\n\nOne user posted a video of a nurse manually pumping air into the lungs of an infant. Others posted photos of long lines of cars queuing up at gas stations in hopes of getting fuel. A man anguished that he'd gone 17 hours without hearing from his mother.\n\n\"What impotence!\" he lamented.\n\nNetblocks, a non-government group based in Europe that monitors internet censorship, said online connectivity data indicates the outage is the largest in recent record in Latin America. The observatory warned Friday that some of the remaining networks were starting to fall offline as generators and backups began depleting and cell towers shut down.\n\nThe director of CODEVIDA, a coalition of Venezuelan health advocacy groups, reported that thousands of dialysis patients were going without treatment as a result of the blackout. While some hospitals were able to rely on back-up power sources, others were dark.\n\nAt the maternity ward at the Avila Clinic in wealthy eastern Caracas Thursday night, several mothers wept as nurses held candles to monitor the vital signs of premature babies in incubators.\n\nZaida Rodriguez, 40, a cardiovascular technician, walked several miles to the private clinic where she works only to be told by bosses that she should leave because the facility would treat only urgent cases and operate with a skeletan staff in order to save on power.\n\n\"How is it possible for an oil country like ours to be without an emergency backup in place for these types of situations?\" she asked. \"This is pathetic.\"\n\nVenezuela's electrical system was once the envy of Latin America but it has fallen into disrepair after years of poor maintenance and mismanagement. High-ranking officials have been accused in U.S. court proceedings of looting government money earmarked for the electrical system.\n\nWhile intermittent outages have become regular occurrences in Venezuela of late, rarely have so many states simultaneously been without power for such an extended period. Until now, Caracas had largely been spared the worst of a collapse in the nation's grid.\n\nThe government keeps home power bills exceptionally low \u2014 just a couple dollars a month \u2014 relying heavily on subsidies from the Maduro administration, which is under increasing financial duress.\n\nThe nation is experiencing hyperinflation projected to reach a mind-boggling 10 million percent this year, is grappling with food and medical shortages, and has lost about 10 percent of its population to migration in the past few years \u2014 including many with valuable energy expertise. Venezuela's economic woes are likely to increase as U.S. sanctions against its oil industry kick in.\n\nState-owned electricity operator Corpoelec blamed the outage on an act of \"sabotage\" at the Guri Dam, one of the world's largest hydroelectric stations and the cornerstone of Venezuela's electrical grid. Information Minister Jorge Rodriguez described it as a \"cyber\" attack intended to derail the whole system. He said electricity in Venezuela's eastern region had been restored within hours.\n\n\"What's the intention?\" he said. \"To submit the Venezuelan people to various days without electricity to attack, to mistreat, so that vital areas would be without power.\"\n\nPro-government officials often blame outages on Venezuela's opposition, accusing them of attacking power substations with Molotov cocktails, though they rarely provide any evidence.\n\nGuaido did a survey of Caracas Friday to evaluate the impact of the blackout, blaming Maduro for the sorry state of affairs and looking to capitalize on what some decried as a sign of Venezuela's newfound status as a \"failed state\" even though it sits atop the world's largest oil reserves.\n\nPeople wait for public transportation amid the country's worst-ever power outage in Caracas on March 8, 2019. Eduardo Verdugo / AP\n\n\"It's clear who is responsible for this disaster,\" he said, renewing his call for Venezuelans to take to the streets Saturday in protest. \"They keep making excuses, they keep looking for scapegoats, when corruption, calamity are what have caused this situation.\"\n\nRubio, who has been driving the Trump administration's confrontational stance toward Maduro, seemed to relish Rodriguez's accusations that he was somehow to blame for the power crisis.\n\n\"My apologies to people of Venezuela,\" the Florida Republican said in a message on Twitter. \"I must have pressed the wrong thing on the 'electronic attack' app I downloaded from Apple. My bad.\"\n\nThe blackout snarled traffic amid confusion generated by blackened stoplights; the subway in Caracas broke down; and there were reports that a flight Thursday from neighboring Colombia was turned back because the Caracas airport's backup generators failed, leaving customs officials without the ability to screen those arriving.\n\nA video posted online of the Caracas airport showed angry passengers waiting in front of check-in counters in the dark Thursday demanding to be let on planes.\n\n\"Flight! Flight! Flight!\" they cried out.\n\nAs the blackout wore on, Venezuelans already struggling to put food on the table worried the little they have would get spoiled in fridges without power. Business owners griped over losses that were certain to compound their already bleak economic outlook.\n\n\"The only thing left for me to do is wait for the light to return,\" said Jose Rodriguez, 51, the owner of a small restaurant in Caracas. \"Today will be a lost day for me.\"\n\nFOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM.",

    "description": "Pompeo's message naturally sets off warning bells that the U.S. is preparing to escalate its role in the crisis.",
    "text": "The last remaining personnel at the U.S. embassy in Caracas are being withdrawn from the country:\n\nThe U.S. will withdraw all remaining personnel from @usembassyve this week. This decision reflects the deteriorating situation in #Venezuela as well as the conclusion that the presence of U.S. diplomatic staff at the embassy has become a constraint on U.S. policy. \u2014 Secretary Pompeo (@SecPompeo) March 12, 2019\n\nThe embassy should have been evacuated weeks ago, but the administration insisted on keeping some people there so that it didn\u2019t look as if they were complying with Maduro\u2019s order that American diplomats be expelled from the country. The administration has been willing to put U.S. diplomats in Venezuela at risk for more than a month while they try to overthrow the government. They had originally thought that regime change would be quick and easy, but as the standoff is starting to be measured in months rather than weeks we can see that it isn\u2019t gong to be either of those things. Now Pompeo ominously describes the diplomats\u2019 presence there as a \u201cconstraint\u201d on U.S. policy. Taken together with the threatening rhetoric from Rubio, Bolton, and Pence, that naturally sets off warning bells that the U.S. is preparing to escalate its role in the crisis.\n\nIt is possible that Pompeo\u2019s message is more of his usual \u201cswaggering\u201d bluster that is supposed to intimidate but just makes the Secretary of State look ridiculous. But it is also possible that this a prelude to some reckless administration action and possibly even the start of an attack on the Venezuelan government. Whatever they end up doing, the administration track record inspires no confidence in their judgment or competence. They are very likely going to do the wrong thing and they will also make a mess of it when they do. No matter what excuse the administration uses for further meddling in Venezuela\u2019s internal affairs, we cannot trust that this is the real reason for what they are doing.\n\nWe have already seen how eagerly administration officials spread false information about events in Venezuela:\n\nVice President Mike Pence wrote that \u201cthe tyrant in Caracas danced\u201d as his henchmen \u201cburned food & medicine.\u201d The State Department released a video saying Mr. Maduro had ordered the trucks burned. And Venezuela\u2019s opposition held up the images of the burning aid, reproduced on dozens of news sites and television screens throughout Latin America, as evidence of Mr. Maduro\u2019s cruelty. But there is a problem: The opposition itself, not Mr. Maduro\u2019s men, appears to have set the cargo alight accidentally.\n\nWhen confronted with the evidence, U.S. officials\u2019 response has been to shrug and hold Maduro responsible anyway. Any claims that the administration makes about Venezuela have to be regarded with intense suspicion. The same officials that have repeatedly lied about Yemen, Iran, and other issues to justify outrageous and indefensible policies will have no problem lying to advance their regime change policy in Venezuela.",

Six of the country\u2019s 23 states still lacked power as of Saturday afternoon, Socialist Party Vice President Diosdado Cabello said on state television.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all upset that we\u2019ve got no power, no phone service, no water and they want to block us,\u201d said Rossmary Nascimiento, 45, a nutritionist at the Caracas rally. \u201cI want a normal country.\u201d\n\nAt a competing march organized by the Socialist Party to protest what it calls US imperialism, Maduro blamed the outages on \u201celectromagnetic and cyber attacks directed from abroad by the empire.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe right wing, together with the empire, has stabbed the electricity system, and we are trying to cure it soon,\u201d he said.\n\nSeveral hundred people gathered at the rally in central Caracas for a march to denounce the crippling US oil sanctions aimed at cutting off the Maduro government\u2019s funding sources.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re here, we\u2019re mobilized, because we\u2019re not going to let the gringos take over,\u201d said Elbadina Gomez, 76, who works for an activist group linked to the Socialist Party.\n\nCLINICS IDLE\n\nJulio Castro, a doctor and member of a nongovernmental organization called Doctors For Health, tweeted that a total of 17 people had died during the blackout, including nine deaths in emergency rooms.\n\nReuters was unable to independently confirm the deaths or whether they could have resulted from the blackout. The Information Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nClinics in the sweltering western state of Zulia, which suffers chronic regional blackouts, had scaled back operations after nearly 72 hours without power.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not offering services and we don\u2019t have any patients staying here because the generator is not working,\u201d said Chiquinquira Caldera, head of administration at the San Lucas clinic in the city of Maracaibo, as she played a game of Chinese checkers with doctors who were waiting for power to return.\n\nVenezuela, already suffering from hyperinflation and shortages of basic goods, has been mired in a major political crisis since Guaido assumed the interim presidency in January, calling Maduro a usurper following the 2018 election, which Maduro won but was widely considered fraudulent.\n\nMaduro says Guaido is a puppet of Washington and dismisses his claim to the presidency as an effort by the administration of US President Donald Trump to control Venezuela\u2019s oil wealth.\n\nFormer mayor and exiled opposition activist Antonio Ledezma on Saturday called on Guaido to seek United Nations intervention in Venezuela by invoking a principle known as \u201cresponsibility to protect.\u201d\n\nThe U.N. doctrine sometimes referred to as R2P was created to prevent mass killings such as those of Rwanda and Bosnia and places the onus on the international community to protect populations from crimes against humanity and ethnic cleansing.\n\n\u201cPresident @jguaido, (you should) formally request Humanitarian Intervention, applying the concept of R2P, to stop extermination, genocide and destruction of what\u2019s left of our country,\u201d Ledezma wrote via Twitter.\n\nAt the opposition rally, Guaido said he would not invoke an article of the Venezuelan constitution allowing the congress to authorize foreign military operations within Venezuela \u201cuntil we have to.\u201d\n\n\u201cArticle 187 when the time comes,\u201d Guaido said. \u201cWe need to be in the streets, mobilized. It depends on us, not on anybody else.\u201d\n\nAdvertising\n\nTrump has said that a \u201cmilitary option\u201d is on the table with regard to Venezuela, but Latin American neighbours have emphatically opposed a US intervention as a way of addressing the situation.",

    "text": "Lally Weymouth is a senior associate editor for The Washington Post.\n\nJuan Guaid\u00f3, Venezuela\u2019s compelling and popular interim president is the first real threat to the authoritarian regime of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, who has refused to yield power after what the legislature called an invalid election. In search of momentum for the opposition, Guaid\u00f3 left his country two weeks ago to take meetings with foreign leaders (including with Vice President Pence) in Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Ecuador. Venezuelan exiles in those nations poured into the streets to greet him. But if he was expecting the military to abandon the regime and support his claim to the presidency, it didn\u2019t work. What will happen when Guaid\u00f3, 35, returns to Venezuela? Maduro\u2019s regime may arrest him, or perhaps he\u2019ll galvanize Maduro\u2019s backers and win their loyalty. More likely, the standoff will continue. Guaid\u00f3 talked with The Washington Post\u2019s Lally Weymouth as he prepares to reenter his country. Edited excerpts follow.\n\nQ: Why did you leave Venezuela?\n\nA: I [initially] left to attend the humanitarian assistance gathering where Colombia\u2019s President Iv\u00e1n Duque as well as Paraguay\u2019s President Mario Abdo Ben\u00edtez were present.\n\nQ: To leave was a big risk. Did you make the right call?\n\nA: My international visit has been very important to consolidate support from regional leaders \u2014 not just for humanitarian assistance but to continue to pressure Maduro.\n\nQ: Do you see any way to get rid of Maduro?\n\nA: I see many ways of getting rid of Maduro. He\u2019s completely isolated, so much so that his only recourse is to continue to repress and use force against the people of Venezuela. The use of force is by paramilitary groups, it isn\u2019t even the National Guard.\n\nQ: Is the army split? There were 200 defections from the military, but many officers have not defected.\n\nA: Two hundred is only a small portion. The vast majority of the armed forces, 80 percent, support me and reject the regime. It\u2019s just the top people who continue to hold on. There is a lot of fear, because of the types of tactics that they\u2019re using.\n\nQ: Is it possible to get rid of Maduro without the use of force?\n\nA: In Venezuela, we have tried everything. We have protested, we have continued to push in every direction for a peaceful transition. Right now, I see three scenarios. First, that an election is allowed to take place in a free and transparent manner. That\u2019s what we\u2019re working for as soon as possible. Second is some sort of sui generis transition with Chavismo [parts of the regime]. That\u2019s something that\u2019s difficult to imagine at this point.\n\nQ: A transition that includes the military or parts of the regime?\n\nA: I\u2019m referring to something like what happened on January 23 of 1958 \u2014 the date when parts of the military removed the dictator [Marcos P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez]. Lastly, there is an option where the military could get on the side of the constitution and of Guaid\u00f3 and of the resistance, and it could stop the usurpation. That\u2019s the option that uses force, but it comes from within.\n\nQ: So a military coup, so to speak?\n\nA: Yes, but the military gets on the side of the constitution \u2014 so it\u2019s not a military coup. It\u2019s ceasing the usurpation. It is Maduro right now who is the biggest impediment for a peaceful solution to take place.\n\nQ: Is it true that the Cuban agents torture the armed forces if they try to even contact the opposition?\n\nA: Yes, it\u2019s definitely true. Torture is one of the things that is being used to dissuade any sort of dissent in the armed forces, and the Cubans are definitely part of it \u2014 the G2 Cubans, their intelligence service.\n\nQ: Do you have people who you talk to in the military?\n\nA: There are communications channels, but obviously it is a difficult situation, because of the dictatorship and the repression that takes place within the armed forces. It has taken time to build trust among parties.\n\nQ: Will you offer Maduro and his top generals amnesty to dislodge them from power? Will you guarantee them safe passage and access to their money?\n\nA: We have offered amnesty and guarantees to both military and civilians who are part of the regime but who are willing to help restore democracy in Venezuela.\n\nQ: Not a general amnesty?\n\nA: No. Only to those who take those steps.\n\nQ: Can you get rid of Maduro without promising him safe passage and a new home elsewhere?\n\nA: Offering amnesty to Maduro is an option. Bear in mind that the only crimes to which amnesty cannot be applied are crimes against humanity.\n\nQ: You started off as a student leader, and then you ran for congress in 2015. You took over the Popular Will party when its leader was put under house arrest in 2019. As leader of the National Assembly, the only democratically elected institution in the country, you declared yourself interim president in January after the Lima Group, a group of nations from the region, said they would not recognize Maduro's election. Now you're world-famous and recognized by 50 governments. How would you explain who you are to the American people?\n\nA: I am a young man from humble origins who has had the opportunity to serve my country, to resist this dictatorship, along with [other opposition leaders] . . . . Venezuela has immense talents and resources, and we can help rebuild our democracy.\n\nQ: Are you happy with what the Trump administration has done to help the Venezuelan opposition? Would you like President Trump to do more?\n\nA: President Trump\u2019s leadership has been very important to this effort of restoring democracy to Venezuela.\n\nQ: Are the U.S. sanctions enough, or do you need more, like military intervention?\n\nA: The sanctions have been a key element in making sure that those who have violated human rights and are guilty of corruption have a clear consequence to their actions. They have also been key to helping protect the assets of the Venezuelan people.\n\nQ: Not having them stolen, you mean?\n\nA: Yes, and to try to dissuade these people from continuing to steal. In terms of next steps, Vice President Pence has said and I have said that all options are on the table when it comes to restoring democracy in Venezuela.\n\nQ: Do you think some kind of force needs to be used in this situation?\n\nA: We all want a peaceful solution to this situation, but this is a criminal regime that will only cede power under immense pressure. Venezuela is in a very precarious situation with the hyperinflation and the suffering of the Venezuelan people, so change is urgent. There is no food; there is a humanitarian crisis and great suffering by the Venezuelan people.\n\nQ: Are you going to visit Europe \u2014 France or Germany \u2014 before you go home to Venezuela? Will you visit the United States?\n\nA: I do have plans to go to Europe and other countries in Latin America, but I am first going back to Venezuela.\n\nQ: Are you worried you'll be detained or arrested?\n\nA: There are definitely a lot of risks to going back. The exercise of politics is criminalized in Venezuela. But I\u2019m willing to go back and take that risk. . . . If [I were arrested], it would be the usurper\u2019s [Maduro\u2019s] last mistake. This would be a coup d\u2019etat. And it would be harshly and strongly rejected by both the Venezuelan people and the international community.\n\nQ: Do you believe you are losing popularity by being out of the country? You are so popular inside Venezuela.\n\nA: No, not at all. We have been strengthened, both internally and externally, because of this tour. That\u2019s why I\u2019m prepared to go back home.\n\nQ: I saw the pictures of the masses of Venezuelans migrants who came out to meet you in every Latin American country you visited. Did you ever expect to see such a welcome?\n\nA: That\u2019s really happening because of the massive crisis that\u2019s happening in Venezuela. I have taken on this responsibility and it has awakened a lot of hope for change in the Venezuelan population, both inside the country and out.\n\nQ: How will you organize a free and fair election if you do come to power, especially considering the three million Venezuelans who have had to leave the country? The Maduro and Hugo Ch\u00e1vez regimes changed the electoral system, so it's not going to be so easy.\n\nA: One of the first points is to completely reform the National Electoral Council. Furthermore, I\u2019m going to make sure that all constitutional rights are guaranteed to elect and be elected. That is to say, all the Venezuelans who are abroad should be properly registered, and all the people within the country should be also be properly registered. It\u2019s important to make sure that no candidates are barred from running. Moreover, it\u2019s very important to have the international community present observing the election to make sure its completely transparent.\n\nQ: You won't be able to do that overnight, right?\n\nA: No, it will definitely take time. Our best experts have looked at this and determined that once [Maduro is gone from power], it could take from six to nine months.\n\nQ: The economy of Venezuela is in a free fall. Are you concerned about the impact of new U.S. sanctions on the population? Do you have a vision as to what you would do as president to rebuild your country? Do you think that Venezuela would need a Marshall Plan?\n\nA: The economy was in a free fall before the sanctions. There has been a 53 percent GDP drop and a 1 million percent inflation rate. There was already a very bad situation before the sanctions. What we are worried about, what we are trying to move forward on, is using our natural resources, using the trust we have built with the international community to have access to refinancing.\n\nTwitter: @LallyWeymouth\n\nRead more perspectives at washingtonpost.com/outlook\n\nRead more from Outlook:\n\nFollow our updates on Facebook and Twitter.",

    "description": "President Nicolas Maduro's Socialist government, which blamed the United States and the opposition for the previous power cut, said an \"attack\" on its electrical system caused the blackout that first hit on Monday.",
    "text": "Venezuela\u2019s government told workers and school children to stay home on Tuesday as the second major blackout this month left the streets of Caracas mostly empty and residents wondering how long power would be out amid a deepening economic crisis. President Nicolas Maduro\u2019s Socialist government, which blamed the United States and the opposition for the previous power cut, said an \u201cattack\u201d on its electrical system caused the blackout that first hit on Monday. The outage shuttered businesses, paralyzed the country\u2019s main oil export terminal, and stranded commuters.\n\nAdvertising\n\nIn eastern Caracas, several dozen people unable to work in stores and offices were boarding a bus toward the poor hillside community of Filas de Mariche, where residents said services were worse than in the city center.\n\n\u201cIf the blackout lasts two days down here, it\u2019ll last five up there,\u201d said Maria Ojeda, 20, who works at a pi\u00f1ata shop in Caracas. \u201cI\u2019m going home because there\u2019s no work, there\u2019s nothing going on.\u201d\n\nThe blackout came amid tensions with the United States over the weekend arrival of Russian military planes, which led Washington to accuse Moscow of \u201creckless escalation\u201d of the country\u2019s political crisis.\n\nAdvertising\n\nRussia, which has major energy investments in OPEC member Venezuela, has remained a staunch ally of Maduro, while the United States and most other Western nations have endorsed opposition leader Juan Guaido.\n\nCiting the constitution, Guaido in January assumed the interim presidency, saying Maduro\u2019s re-election last year was fraudulent. Maduro says Guaido is a U.S. puppet attempting to lead a coup against him and has blamed worsening economic difficulties on sanctions imposed by Washington.\n\nPower had returned to many parts of Caracas by noon on Tuesday, but businesses remained idle and few pedestrians were walking the streets. Those who went to work because they had not heard that the workday had been canceled were returning to their homes.\n\n\u201cHow am I supposed to find out, if there\u2019s no power and no internet?\u201d said dental assistant Yolanda Gonzalez, 50, waiting for the bus near a Caracas plaza. \u201cPower\u2019s going to get worse, you\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nGOVERNMENT BLAMES \u201cFAR RIGHT\u201d\n\nVenezuela\u2019s western cities, including Maracaibo and Barquisimeto, as well as the central city of Valencia, also had no power on Tuesday, according to witnesses. The largest oil export terminal of Jose was paralyzed by the outage, according to two oil industry workers and a union leader, while Refinitiv Eikon data showed no ships had left the terminal since Sunday.\n\nInformation Minister Jorge Rodriguez on Monday said the blackout that began in the early afternoon was the result of an attack on Venezuela\u2019s main hydroelectric Guri dam which had affected three major transmission lines.\n\nRodriguez did not explicitly blame Monday\u2019s outage on any particular individual or group. But he said, \u201cthe intention of Venezuela\u2019s far right is to attack, generate anxiety and anguish, in order to seize power and steal all our resources.\u201d\n\nBrazil Mines and Energy Minister Bento Albuquerque said on Tuesday that Venezuela had not complied with its contract to supply northern Roraima state with energy since March 7, without providing details.\n\nVenezuela had suffered its worst blackout ever starting on March 7. For nearly a week it left millions of people struggling to obtain food and water and hospitals without power to treat the sick. Looting in the western state of Zulia destroyed hundreds of businesses.\n\nElectricity experts say the outages are the result of inadequate maintenance and incompetent management of the power grid since the late President Hugo Ch\u00e1vez nationalized the sector in 2007.\n\nVenezuelan Socialist Party Vice President Diosdado Cabello confirmed that two planes had flown to the country from Russia during the weekend, but he did not give a reason or say whether they carried troops.\n\nAdvertising\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly refused to rule out military intervention in Venezuela, although regional leaders have expressed grave misgivings about U.S. troops being deployed to Latin American soil.",

    "description": "These pages had an estimated reach \u201cof at least 200 million\u201d and, in some cases, were digital businesses worth a few crores.",
    "text": "BENGALURU: Facebook\u2019s crackdown on Monday majorly affected not just pages and accounts that appeared to promote views of India\u2019s major opposition party Congress and Pakistan\u2019s military establishment, but also \u201ca large number\u201d of Rightleaning pages in India.These pages had an estimated reach \u201cof at least 200 million\u201d and, in some cases, were digital businesses worth a few crores. These pages dealt in content that were largely pro-BJP but they did not carry any official affiliation with the ruling party. The actions were in addition to Facebook\u2019s announcement of unpublishing \u2018The India Eye\u2019, a BJP-leaning Facebook page linked to employees of an Ahmedabad-based IT firm \u2014 Silver Touch.ET gathered this information after talking to multiple content entrepreneurs hit by Facebook\u2019s action. These people spoke off record.Facebook, as its head of cybersecurity policy Nathaniel Gleicher said on Monday, removed 227 pages and 94 accounts from India for violating its policies against spam and misrepresentation.These pages, Facebook said, were \u201cengaging in behaviours that expressly violate our policies\u201d. Such behaviour includes using fake accounts, multiple accounts with same names, impersonation, posting links to malware, and posting \u201cmassive amounts of content across a network of groups and pages to drive traffic to websites that (they) are affiliated with\u201d.Most entrepreneurs behind Rightleaning views owned multiple pages that were variously pro-BJP, pro-Narendra Modi, or pro-Hindutva. Their behaviour violation, detected by Facebook\u2019s algorithm, would involve cross-posting a piece of content across multiple pages they owned, around the same time. The crackdown was not against \u201cfake news\u201d or \u201ccontent\u201d but was mostly about \u201cbehaviour\u201d.Some of these Facebook pages include those run by MyNation, a portal owned by Asianet News Network. Some other pages that were taken down include Post Card News, Dainik Bharat and Nation Wants NaMo.Unofficial estimates, according to several people ET spoke to, suggest that Right-leaning pages having 200 million \u2018likes\u2019 have been taken down by Facebook. Each of the producers ET spoke to owned multiple (20-30) pages with 12-15 million \u2018likes\u2019 for each. These have been built into digital properties over the past four years, thanks to high user engagement with political content and Facebook\u2019s Instant Articles feature.A Delhi-based content entrepreneur, who owned pages with 12 million \u2018likes\u2019 that were taken down by Facebook, told ET, \u201cMost of my pages were deemed to be pro-Modi or pro-Army. Two-three days ago, Facebook asked us to unpublish content on the Venezuela crisis and the Iran crisis, which we anyway did not post. Today, they have clean-swept us, removing us without any notification.\u201dHe added that these entrepreneurs will use their remaining Facebook pages to create awareness about the issue, besides sending Facebook a legal notice. \u201cWhat other option do we have? We have spent lakhs and crores (of rupees) building these pages, and now they are all gone.\u201d",

    "text": "CLOSE President Trump wants to release classified documents from the Russia probe. He and former FBI director James Comey weighed in on the Mueller report. USA Today\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 Energized by special counsel Robert Mueller's finding of \"no collusion\" with Russia, President Donald Trump is relitigating a host of contentious policy battles \u2013 from health care to immigration \u2013 that could dramatically shape his reelection effort.\n\nTrump faces a political dynamic on Capitol Hill that has not changed. Democrats, who control the House and have the power to block his initiatives, remain hostile to his agenda. But the president has ramped up his rhetoric on immigration, reopened fights over health care and storm-ravaged Puerto Rico and vowed to \"fix\" the crisis in Venezuela.\n\n\"Now that the Mueller report is behind them, the White House feels liberated to start putting its energy into pursuing its legislative agenda,\" said GOP strategist Ron Bonjean. \"It's likely going to force the House Democratic leadership to stand in the way of its progress, allowing Trump to use his megaphone against them.\"\n\nEyeing the growing field of Democratic candidates seeking to unseat him in 2020, Trump returned to battleground Michigan for a rally Thursday in which he reveled in the findings from the Mueller report summary and repeatedly slammed his critics.\n\n\"The collusion delusion is over,\" Trump told supporters at the Grand Rapids rally, where he debuted his renewed intention to fight on several policy fronts.\n\nHere's a look at the president's post-Mueller approach:\n\n'Party of Health care!'\n\nTrump shocked Republicans and Democrats this week by reopening a fight over Obamacare that many believed he already fought and lost.\n\nA decade after the Affordable Care Act became law, Trump's administration told a federal court it would support tossing the law, reversing an earlier strategy. The president promised the GOP would become the \"party of health care,\" but the administration has not proposed a plan in two years to save the popular aspects of the plan, like guaranteed coverage for people with preexisting conditions.\n\nObamacare repeal: Senate narrowly defeats 'skinny repeal' of Obamacare, as McCain votes 'no'\n\nMcCain: Senate members gasp, applaud as McCain votes no on 'skinny repeal'\n\nRepublicans revoked a central Obamacare provision that required Americans to purchase health insurance or face a tax penalty, but the party has failed to repeal the law in its entirety. And some Republicans have expressed anxiety about reopening the issue.\n\n\"We're working on a plan now,\" Trump, apparently undaunted by those concerns, told reporters on Thursday. \"We will have a plan that's far better than Obamacare.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump (Photo: Jacquelyn Martin/AP)\n\nImmigration redux\n\nTrump is stepping up his battle on an issue that both parties in Congress have sought to avoid: Immigration. Trump has touted early work on his proposed wall along the U.S-Mexico border and has threatened to close the southern border entirely.\n\nIn recent days, the president again has raised the prospect of closing the U.S.-Mexico border, a threat he has made previously without executing. At his rally Thursday night and in a series of tweets Friday, Trump claimed Mexico is not doing enough to stop Central American migrants from crossing the border.\n\nThe logistical challenges and potential impact of closing the U.S.-Mexico border would be enormous, experts have said.\n\nBorder: Trump threatens to close border if Mexico doesn't 'immediately stop' immigrants\n\nMeanwhile, some aides are still in the hunt for a broader solution on immigration.\n\nJared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and top adviser, has been meeting with experts and stakeholders to discuss potential reforms to legal immigration, said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports tougher immigration laws. Kushner had tried to strike that broader deal late last year as part of the failed negotiations that led to a 35-day government shutdown.\n\nAs with health care, it's not clear there's much appetite in Congress to address immigration, particularly as the presidential election heats up.\n\n\"The Dems refuse to do what they know is necessary \u2013 amend our immigration laws,\" Trump wrote on Twitter on Thursday. \"Would immediately solve the problem!\"\n\nWe have a National Emergency at our Southern Border. The Dems refuse to do what they know is necessary - amend our immigration laws. Would immediately solve the problem! Mexico, with the strongest immigration laws in the World, refuses to help with illegal immigration & drugs! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 28, 2019\n\nTrade talks\n\nTrump met with Republican lawmakers at the White House on Tuesday as the administration prepares to shepherd its NAFTA replacement through Congress. The new U.S.-Canada-Mexico trade deal, which the president has dubbed USMCA, needs only a simple majority to clear both chambers, but the measure faces dicey prospects in the Democrat-controlled House.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House sent high-level officials to Beijing this week to try to negotiate a way out of the impasse with China over trade. While both sides have stepped back from the tit-for-tat trade war that roiled markets last year, many existing barriers continue to affect manufacturing and agricultural industries.\n\nNew green punching bag\n\nThe Green New Deal, Democrats' aspirational proposal to confront climate change, has become a rallying cry for Trump, who has used it as an example of how Democratic candidates are veering to the left in Trump's Washington.\n\nThe proposal calls for combating climate change by eliminating carbon emissions and shifting the economy to one powered by renewable fuels. Trump sees the policy prescriptions in the plan, blocked by a procedural vote in the Senate on Tuesday,\n\nas a winning touchstone among his core voters.\n\nTrump has not proposed a plan to address climate change, which he described as a \"hoax\" during the 2016 campaign.\n\n\"What about brilliant policies like the Green New Deal?\" the president's son Donald Trump Jr. asked supporters during the Michigan rally. \"What's scarier about the Green New Deal is that every mainstream Democrat leading presidential contender is like 'this is a great idea!'\"\n\nCLOSE Utah Republican Senator Mike Lee used posters showing Aquaman and Star Wars characters to paint the Green New Deal bill as \"ridiculous.\" USA TODAY\n\nPuerto Rico aid\n\nTrump defended his record on Puerto Rico Thursday amid reports he is reopening a debate over the amount of federal aid allocated to the island after Hurricane Maria, which made landfall in 2017.\n\nDuring a meeting with Senate Republicans, Trump questioned why Puerto Rico was receiving billions of dollars in aid, according to reports. Trump has had a longstanding feud with Puerto Rican officials, including San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, though the issue had subsided somewhat before moving to the fore again this week.\n\nThe coverage of Trump's remarks prompted Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 to issue a stern warning to Trump on Thursday. \"If the bully gets close, I'll punch the bully in the mouth,\" Rossell\u00f3 told CNN in an interview. \"It would be a mistake to confuse courtesy with courage.\"\n\nTrump fired back in remarks at the White House.\n\n\"Puerto Rico has been taken care of better by Donald Trump than by any living human being and I think the people of Puerto Rico understand it,\" Trump said. \"They don't know how to spend the money and they're not spending it wisely.\"\n\nContributing: Christal Hayes\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/03/29/donald-trump-post-mueller-strategy-healthcare/3301427002/",

    "description": "While most of the attention is on Venezuela, another crisis is brewing under Daniel Ortega's authoritarian regime.",
    "text": "The Trump administration continues to tighten the screws on Venezuela\u2019s left-wing regime, imposing new economic sanctions and recognizing Juan Guido\u2019s claim to be the country\u2019s new interim president over current ruler Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Trump has openly lobbied the Venezuelan military to break with Maduro, and has stated ominously that \u201call options\u201d\u2014including apparently a U.S. military intervention\u2014remain on the table. There is little doubt that the administration is pursuing regime change in Caracas.\n\nWhile most of the attention is focused on the volatile situation in Venezuela, however, another crisis is brewing nearby in Nicaragua. As in Venezuela, rising domestic discontent with a socialist government has led to large-scale demonstrations demanding change. And as in Venezuela, the beleaguered regime has responded with harsh, authoritarian measures.\n\nNicaragua\u2019s incumbent president is Washington\u2019s old nemesis from the 1980s, Sandinista leader Daniel Ortega. The Reagan administration expended considerable effort, including training and arming a cadre of anti-communist rebels, the so-called Contras, in an unsuccessful effort to oust the Sandinistas. Ultimately, Ortega agreed to hold free elections in 1990, and when opposition factions won, to the surprise of most U.S. officials, he relinquished power peacefully. Ortega returned to office following elections in 2007.\n\nDuring his second stint in office, the government adopted increasingly authoritarian measures, and by 2018, opposition demonstrations were large and vocal. Protests surged in April 2018, and by early August, even the Ortega government reluctantly acknowledged that 195 people had died in the mounting violence. The Organization of American States (OAS) put the figure at 317, and a leading NGO, the Nicaraguan Pro-Human Rights Association, documented 448 killings. It also contended that government security forces and allied, armed civilian groups were responsible for most of those deaths.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe government did not take kindly to such criticism. Shortly after issuing its most recent report, the Nicaraguan Pro-Human Rights Association announced that it was closing its offices because of \u201cthreats and harassment\u201d against staff members. Ortega defended the violent actions that police and pro-regime paramilitary units had taken. He exhibited no receptivity whatsoever to opposition calls for a referendum on holding early national elections in place of the balloting scheduled for late 2020. Given that the last elections in 2016 were afflicted with widespread fraud, critics of the regime see little benefit in being patient.\n\nWashington moved to adopt punitive sanctions in response to the regime\u2019s crackdown on last summer\u2019s demonstrations. In November, the Trump administration imposed travel restrictions and targeted the assets of several high-level officials. Washington\u2019s justifications echoed those used to justify even harsher measures taken against the Venezuelan government. The text of the Treasury Department order stated that the action was a counter to the Nicaraguan government\u2019s corruption, its \u201cviolent response\u201d to protests, and its \u201csystematic dismantling and undermining of democratic institutions and the rule of law.\u201d\n\nVice President Rosario Murillo and her political operators \u201chave systematically sought to dismantle democratic institutions and loot the wealth of Nicaragua to consolidate their grip on power,\u201d Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in a statement. \u201cTreasury is intent on ensuring that Ortega regime insiders are not able to access the U.S. financial system to profit at the expense of the Nicaraguan people.\u201d Murillo was an especially prominent target, since she is not only the country\u2019s vice president, but Ortega\u2019s wife, and is generally considered to be an even more hardline socialist than her spouse.\n\nNot only is the U.S. stance towards Nicaragua hardening, but Trump administration statements increasingly link together policy regarding Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua. Officials seem to regard those governments as a triumvirate of hemispheric troublemakers. Given Trump\u2019s rollback of much of the Obama administration\u2019s rapprochement with Cuba, and his open flirtation with the military option against Venezuela, Nicaraguan leaders have to be more than a little uneasy.\n\nAfter a relatively calm period in early 2019, tensions appear to be flaring again. Government security forces arrested more than a hundred people following demonstrations in mid-March, and hundreds more remain in jail from last year\u2019s protests. The Ortega regime also has intensified an already worrisome campaign to smother the country\u2019s independent press. All of this is eerily reminiscent of Venezuela\u2019s gradual transition from a somewhat illiberal democracy to a barely disguised dictatorship facing an increasingly angry and determined political opposition.\n\nThus far, the U.S. response has been milder and less intrusive than its campaign against Maduro. Washington has not yet declared Nicaragua to be a national security threat to the United States, as President Barack Obama did with respect to Venezuela in 2015. But it isn\u2019t certain how long that more cautious approach will last. Indeed, it is likely that the relatively restrained posture is only because the Trump administration doesn\u2019t relish taking on two hemispheric regime change campaigns simultaneously.\n\nNo one should find the governments of Venezuela and Nicaragua worthy of praise. The former destroyed a once flourishing economy by imposing disastrous socialist economic policies and then responded to peaceful political opposition with brutally repressive measures. It is an ugly, corrupt dictatorship that deserves to end up on the ash heap of history. Ortega\u2019s regime is not much better, and one hopes the Nicaraguan people can bring to power a better, more democratic successor.\n\nNevertheless, it is not the proper role of the United States to interfere in the internal affairs of either country. Even the imposition of economic sanctions would be inappropriate, much less launching a military intervention. At the same time, opponents of U.S. meddling should stop whitewashing the odious record of the Venezuelan and Nicaraguan leftist regimes. There is no need to excuse, much less lionize, socialist autocrats while opposing Washington\u2019s fondness for forcible regime change. Those are separate issues and should remain so.\n\nThe Venezuelan and Nicaraguan governments have brought their populations widespread misery. Such arrogant socialist regimes deserve whatever fate they suffer at the hands of their abused people. But constructive political change or even outright revolution is the responsibility of the Venezuelans and Nicaraguans, not the United States.\n\nTed Galen Carpenter, a senior fellow in security studies at the Cato Institute and a contributing editor at The American Conservative, is the author of 12 books and more than 750 articles on international affairs.

    "text": "Among the Gilets Jaunes\n\nJust two points to add to Jeremy Harding\u2019s excellent piece on the continually surprising gilets jaunes (LRB, 21 March). First, the durability of general public support for the movement is, I think, largely owed to the daily visibility of ordinary people demonstrating at road junctions and roundabouts throughout the country. The sight of (mainly older) careworkers and pensioners standing out in the cold and wet with their placards, barbecues and picnics inspires a cheerful respect from a great number of people who would be completely put off if they were aware of the movement only through media coverage of the violence that takes place on the fringes of the weekly actions in the big cities. Second, the movement is a powerful demonstration of the near bankruptcy of party politics in France. Since the electoral collapse of the Communist Party, all the traditional parties have struggled to attract viable levels of membership or significant non-state funding and are now widely perceived as tools for a tiny minority of the wealthy and/or educated to exercise power without any real engagement with the mass of the population. The success of Macron and his centrist party in 2017 was itself a symptom of the widening gulf between people and politicians. As Harding points out, Macron\u2019s adoption of a right-of-centre neoliberal position once in power was a fundamental cause of the rise of the gilets jaunes. Perhaps more significant, however, is the complete failure of both the extreme right (the recently renamed Rassemblement National) and the extreme left (M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s France Insoumise) in their attempts to infiltrate and recuperate the gilets jaunes. Not unlike much of the support for Brexit, the movement is a massive and simultaneous rejection of all current political offerings. Jon Harry\n\nBordeaux\n\nCrisis in Venezuela\n\nI\u2019m not surprised Malcolm Deas disagrees with my assessment of the situation in Venezuela (Letters, 7 March). But I do take issue with his suggestion that I attempted to \u2018disguise\u2019 the nature of the crisis there. I simply described the actual character and positions of the Venezuelan opposition, and highlighted the less than pure motives of the external actors who have involved themselves in Venezuelan affairs. As for his claim that the crisis \u2018certainly is about restoring democracy and prosperity to Venezuela\u2019, I would ask Deas, as a distinguished historian of Latin America, how many instances of US-driven regime change in the region he can identify that have improved the lot of the population as a whole. The weight of historical examples, from the removal of Jacobo Arbenz in Guatemala in 1954 to the coup in Honduras in 2009, tilts overwhelmingly in the other direction, with regime change bringing neither prosperity nor democracy, but instead decades of poverty, dictatorship and in some cases genocidal wars. (I leave aside notable examples from outside the region such as Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya etc.) Like it or not, any realistic assessment of what is going to happen next in Venezuela must at the very least reckon with the strong possibility of a similar outcome. Pace Deas, it seems \u2018absurd and perverse\u2019 to pretend otherwise. Tony Wood\n\nNew York\n\nHitch\n\nDaniel Soar writes about Christopher Hitchens (LRB, 21 March). Hitchens, along with his brother, Peter, attended The Leys school in Cambridge in the 1960s. The Leys is a Methodist foundation. Shortly before Hitchens died I was organising a reunion at the school for his years. Although he hadn\u2019t been in contact at all since he left, he flew in from New York for the occasion. During the day it is our habit to arrange a chapel service, attendance voluntary (there was of course compulsory daily chapel in his day). It is well attended, though some go off to the pub. This particular year, shortly after the service had started, Christopher slipped in at the back. Afterwards I expressed my surprise. He responded: \u2018I learned more in that building than in any other place in the school.\u2019 John Harding\n\nDry Drayton, Cambridgeshire\n\nThe Vice President\u2019s Men\n\nMarc Dubin\u2019s Latin American specialist declared that his career had been compromised because of his principled refusal to draw up a feasibility study for a nuclear first strike against the Soviet Union (Letters, 21 March). The notion that nuclear strike plans of any sort would be drawn up by a Latin America specialist or any number of them is fantastical in itself, and of course by the time Ronald Reagan became president and rejected them all, there were any number of nuclear strike plans. It seems that even after all these years the idea that Reagan was not a John Birch Society nuclear warrior but its exact opposite is still hard to swallow for some \u2013 much as Trump\u2019s persistent pressure to withdraw US troops from futile wars in hopeless countries is studiously overlooked by his critics, who are determined to find fault with absolutely everything he does. Edward Luttwak\n\nChevy Chase, Maryland\n\nMarc Dubin expresses his shock that the US State Department was looking at plans for a first-strike nuclear attack on the Soviet Union. I spent some time in the summer of 1957 at the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica. There were departments devoted to Russian history and others to hydrogen bombs. There was Herman Kahn informing us that even if we suffered a few megadeaths we would come out OK in the end. Stanley Kubrick read all the reports; in Dr Strangelove he named it the Bland Corporation. Jeremy Bernstein\n\nNew York\n\nYou can\u2019t call it that\n\nFerdinand Mount refers in passing to the Ecclesiastical Titles Act 1871, one of Gladstone\u2019s many contributions to a better world (LRB, 21 March). Replacing the overtly anti-Roman Catholic Act of 1851, it enabled the Roman Catholic Church to establish dioceses throughout the UK, and to name them after actual places, although, following strong lobbying from the Church of England they could not be given the same names as existing C of E dioceses. So, for example, Clifton not Bristol, and Westminster not London (this one was highly controversial in that it implied a Roman Catholic archbishop might have some authority over Parliament). A few decades later, the Church of England discovered that it needed to establish new dioceses to deal with the increase of population in industrial areas, a phenomenon that had previously escaped its attention. This time round, as the new dioceses were established, the die-in-a-ditch attitude that \u2018Our dioceses can\u2019t have the same name as Roman Catholic dioceses\u2019 dropped away, and we got the Anglican dioceses of Southwark, Portsmouth, Birmingham, Liverpool and, as recently as 2014, Leeds \u2013 all with the same names as the relatively recently established Roman Catholic dioceses. Timothy Beecroft\n\nSt Albans, Hertfordshire\n\nEven the Buzzard\n\nIn his review of Stephen Moss\u2019s book about how birds got their names, Francis Gooding omits to mention the analysis of the etymology of British bird names undertaken by W.B. Lockwood, which Moss himself credits as \u2018a constant inspiration\u2019 (LRB, 21 February). The prime sources for Lockwood\u2019s lifetime\u2019s work (consolidated in The Oxford Book of British Bird Names, published in 1984) were dictionaries \u2013 the OED, but also dictionaries of Middle English, English Dialect, Scots etc \u2013 as well as the standard ornithological treatises. Lockwood, usefully, also had an extensive command of North and West European languages, including Proto-Indo-European, Proto-Germanic, Faeroese, Icelandic, Frisian and various Celtic tongues. While Moss\u2019s coverage of British bird names is partial and selective, Lockwood discusses the etymology of 257 British species and another 1250 local and dialect names in a concise dictionary half the length of Moss\u2019s volume. Moss\u2019s readers will look in vain for the etymology of evocative and intriguing names such as twite, siskin, avocet, cormorant, garganey, gadwall, pochard, scaup, capercaillie, ptarmigan, goshawk, osprey, and even buzzard. Ian Jackson\n\nEdinburgh\n\nA Country Emptied\n\nIan Jack asks what made possible the lack of compassion on display throughout the period of the Highland Clearances (LRB, 7 March). We should be able to understand it, since we display the same determination to characterise our wishes and interests as economic necessities. In the global South farmers are today being deprived of their land and their water so that these limited resources can be used industrially to provide us with salad leaves. But the refugees from modern agriculture have no empty spaces to go to across the seas, no snug Canadian cabins. Julian Crowe\n\nSt Andrews\n\nIan Jack says \u2018the Sutherland evictees eventually left the country.\u2019 Not all of them. Nancy Dorian has shown that the descendants of some of the evictees stayed in Brora, Golspie and Embo, and continued to speak Gaelic until recently. Ronald Macaulay\n\nClaremont, California\n\nBut for the Poles\n\nLaura Beers mentions the ingratitude shown by the British immediately after the Second World War to the Polish servicemen who fought for the country (LRB, 7 March). The ingratitude was particularly egregious in light of the vital contribution made by Polish fighter pilots in the Battle of Britain in 1940. The outcome rested for some time on a razor\u2019s edge; had it ended in defeat, Britain might well have fallen. Britain was down to its very last airframes and pilots. But it did have the Polish pilots, who were more experienced and combat-ready than most of the British pilots, and had better tactical skills derived from prior experience against the Luftwaffe. \u2018Had it not been for the magnificent work of the Polish squadrons and their unsurpassed gallantry,\u2019 the commander-in-chief of Fighter Command, Air Chief Marshal Hugh Dowding said, \u2018I hesitate to say that the outcome of battle would have been the same.\u2019 Kenneth MacWilliams\n\nPortland, Maine\n\nBenevolent Revolution\n\nNot all the conclusions reached about new forms of political legitimacy after the 1848 Revolutions were as benevolent as those Christopher Clark identifies (LRB, 7 March). King Louis Philippe of France, deposed in February that year after his soldiers fired into a crowd, watched from exile as the new government brutally put down radical uprisings in June and mused, \u2018Republics are lucky: they can shoot people.\u2019 June Farrow\n\nMiddlesbrough\n\nThe Son, Not the Father\n\nIn my recent piece on Justinian\u2019s Code I inadvertently misstated the point at issue in the central theological controversy (LRB, 21 March). This was indeed Christological, dealing solely with the problem of God the Son and having nothing to do with God the Father. The question was whether the son had two different natures, divine and human, in one indivisible divine person, or was one nature, single and indivisible.

    "text": "Crisis in Venezuela\n\nI agree with Malcolm Deas about the problems in Venezuela (Letters, 7 March). Certainly armed intervention would be disastrous, but it should also be said that the rot started long before Maduro took over. What is constantly overlooked is that Ch\u00e1vez comprehensively trashed Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PdVSA). This process started on 7 April 2002, when Ch\u00e1vez contemptuously fired the entire board of PdVSA on TV, blowing a whistle like a football referee, and replacing them with political appointees. Unrest then started in Zulia province, the heart of the industry, and the Confederaci\u00f3n de Trabajadores called for a general strike. This led directly to the \u2018coup\u2019 attempt on 11 April, when around a million people marched from PdVSA headquarters in Caracas to Miraflores in protest. This ended in a shootout with 19 dead; the military stepped in. Neither the military nor the opposition had much idea what to do next. When Ch\u00e1vez returned to power, PdVSA paid a high price. Around 19,000 workers were summarily fired, including many of the engineering staff and the trade unionists. Those who had passports fled abroad to Mexico and Canada, where their expertise was highly valued. Those without passports drove taxis. Having lost a good proportion of PdVSA\u2019s expertise, the government began to pack the company with more and more employees. By 2013, the number ostensibly employed by the oil giant had almost tripled to around 150,000. Naturally, this did not mean that activity in the oil patch had almost tripled \u2013 far from it. Many of these people were employed on a variety of social programmes, paid for directly by the company, though they had little to do with its operations. By 2012, these schemes had cost PdVSA an estimated $44 billion. Ch\u00e1vez also devised a generous scheme of cheap oil exports. He created \u2018Petrocaribe\u2019, which allowed Jamaica, Guyana, Nicaragua, Haiti and others to pay between 5 per cent and 50 per cent of the market rate. The remaining part of the market price would be paid over the course of between 17 and 25 years through a financing scheme funded by Venezuela. By 2013 this is estimated to have cost Venezuela around $45 billion. The scheme has now been run down because the country can no longer supply its more important contracts with China and Russia. Meanwhile the loss of expertise was soon felt. The refineries started to suffer from a lack of routine maintenance. There were major fires in 2003, 2005, 2011 and 2012; in 2012, 48 people were killed. In December 2018, Reuters reported that its massive refining complex at Paraguana was running at only 19 per cent of capacity. As a result Venezuela is increasingly unable to supply its own demand. Apart from higher oil prices globally, what saved PdVSA was its ownership of Citgo, the Houston-based company which specialised in refining Venezuela\u2019s heavy, high-sulphur oil. Citgo, which owns the sixth-largest refinery in the US and provides a substantial amount of US gasoline and diesel, was part of a chain of refinery assets in Aruba, Finland, the UK, Sweden and Belgium that the old PdVSA had gathered over the years. The new regime systematically sold them off, culminating in a failed attempt to flog off Citgo for $10 billion in 2010. If the US had really intended to collapse the Venezuelan economy, shutting down Citgo would have been the easiest way to do it. Environmental standards also started to collapse. Lake Maracaibo has become an embarrassment. There are more than 25,000 km of ancient pipelines leaking underneath the lake. In 2009 the government sacked the companies charged with renewing them. It is estimated that some three thousand barrels of oil are now leaking into the lake every year. Environmental protection and the avoidance of accidents requires money, and if low oil prices are combined with using the oil industry as a cash cow, the result is likely to be disastrous, not least if oil is responsible for 95 per cent of hard currency export earnings. Since 2005, Venezuelan crude production has more than halved from over 3.3 million barrels a day to the current level of 1.5 million. It has ceased to be self-sufficient in oil products and lost a great deal of its considerable expertise. And please don\u2019t fall for the idea that US involvement in Venezuela is \u2018all about oil\u2019. The US is currently the world\u2019s largest producer thanks to fracking. It is exporting more than it ever has in its history and its consumption is falling. Chris Cragg\n\nCalamba, Philippines\n\nGreg Grandin quotes the Wall Street Journal to the effect that Washington\u2019s actions in Venezuela are part of \u2018a larger strategy to transform the hemisphere\u2019 (LRB, 8 February 2019). Malcolm Deas describes this claim as \u2018implausible\u2019 (Letters, 7 March). If this were so, presumably any US intervention would either be confined to Venezuela or else determined by motives other than political change, such as humanitarian need. Yet Grandin summarises the history of US intervention in Latin America, showing that it has very much been motivated by regime change, even when it is nominally \u2018humanitarian\u2019. If the US\u2019s real motives were to tackle suffering and confront the violation of human rights, it wouldn\u2019t prop up unpopular and repressive regimes in Honduras or Haiti, both of which are even closer to its \u2018backyard\u2019 than Venezuela. Perhaps Deas believes that the US will not make what he acknowledges would be the \u2018mistake\u2019 of military intervention. But how can he be so sure? Trump said last month: \u2018We seek a peaceful transition of power but all options are open.\u2019 His national security adviser, John Bolton, and special envoy Elliot Abrams have a track record of promoting armed intervention, especially in Latin America. Abrams has already rejected offers of mediation from Pope Francis as well as the neutral governments of Mexico and Uruguay, saying the time for talks \u2018has long passed\u2019. That any intervention would be part of a \u2018larger strategy\u2019 is hardly in doubt, given that Bolton has labelled Venezuela, Cuba and Nicaragua as a \u2018troika of terror\u2019 and made it clear that once Maduro has been ousted from office, the other two governments will be the next targets. Of course, it is perfectly arguable that while the US has an interventionist agenda, in practice it may not succeed or Trump may back away from sending in US troups if it\u2019s clear that they will be opposed. However, Bolton at least seems convinced that the US can \u2018transform the hemisphere\u2019, even if he has not yet used those words. John Perry\n\nMasaya, Nicaragua\n\nBack the Baker\n\nStephen Sedley refers to a \u2018Christian bakers in Belfast who refused to put \u201cSupport gay marriage\u201d on a gay couple\u2019s wedding cake\u2019 (LRB, 7 February). Actually it wasn\u2019t a wedding cake. It was to be enjoyed in celebration of the campaign to legalise same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland. The UK Supreme Court reversed a decision of the Northern Ireland Appeal Court, which had lent on the doctrine of \u2018associative discrimination\u2019 to find that, by declining to provide services for this political campaign, Ashers bakery was discriminating against all those \u2018associated\u2019 with the benefits of changing the existing law. Potentially this argument would compel any business to provide services in support of any political project which successfully claimed to benefit a protected group, such as followers of \u2018any religious or philosophical belief\u2019. I am critical of the religious right\u2019s manipulation of cases of alleged anti-Christian discrimination to attack the liberal state, but this case was different: the Supreme Court\u2019s decision is a vindication of political liberty. Paul Lusk\n\nWhitstable, Kent\n\nFrink\u2019s Heads\n\nAnne Wagner notes the untypical finish Elisabeth Frink gave to her Goggle Heads series (LRB, 21 February). The smooth, inert and expressionless faces of the violent thugs portrayed have their eyes completely obscured by motorcycle goggles. Four of these monumental bronze hitmen\u2019s heads were included in an open-air exhibition held in Winchester during the summer of 1981. Frink, who was closely involved in the selection of pieces for the exhibition and in deciding where they would be sited, proposed that the heads be placed in pairs on either side of the main entrance to Winchester Crown Court. About a week after the show opened, the organisers (Hampshire County Council) received a complaint from a judge, who objected to the placing of the Goggle Heads, wanting them to be rapidly redeployed elsewhere. Blind justice, it seemed, was unable to deal with the heads\u2019 stares, however inscrutable behind their goggles. We declined the request, citing the artist\u2019s personal choice of location. Frink herself, when we told her about the complaint, was highly amused. Happily, Frink\u2019s bronze Horse and Rider, also included in the 1981 show, has remained on the site that Frink approved in Winchester High Street, and is now listed by Historic England. Christopher Gordon\n\nWinchester, Hampshire\n\nBrexit Blues\n\nDavid Runciman describes Brexit as \u2018the choice of the people\u2019 (LRB, 3 January). Just under 34 per cent of Britons of voting age voted Leave in 2016: that\u2019s 27 per cent of all Britons at that time. Living in Australia, where voting in referendums is compulsory, I find it hard to accept the constant use of verbal readymades to hide the shocking disparity between stating without qualification that \u2018the people\u2019 of Britain voted for Brexit (which, taken at face value, implies we all so voted), and stating the truth: that little more than a quarter of the people of Britain voted for Brexit, and just over a third of the British electorate. Surely it is this part of the UK political system that is most in need of amendment if politicos are to treat referendums as their gospel.

    "text": "Facebook says it shut down more accounts from Russia, Iran and elsewhere seeking to manipulate political sentiment under false pretenses\n\nFacebook said Tuesday it shut down more than 2,600 fake accounts linked to Iran, Russia, Macedonia and Kosovo and aiming to influence political sentiment in various parts of the world.\n\nIt was the latest effort by the leading social network to shut down \"inauthentic\" accounts on Facebook and Instagram seeking to influence politics in the US and elsewhere.\n\nFacebook said the accounts blocked in the four countries were not necessarily centrally coordinated but \"used similar tactics by creating networks of accounts to mislead others about who they were and what they were doing,\" said Nathaniel Gleicher, head of cybersecurity policy for the company.\n\n\"We are constantly working to detect and stop this type of activity because we don't want our services to be used to manipulate people,\" Gleicher said in a blog post.\n\n\"In each case, the people behind this activity coordinated with one another and used fake accounts to misrepresent themselves, and that was the basis for our action.\"\n\nGleicher said Facebook\u2014which has made similar moves in recent months\u2014was making progress in rooting out fake accounts but noted that \"it's an ongoing challenge because the people responsible are determined and well-funded. We constantly have to improve to stay ahead.\"\n\nIn the latest action, Facebook said it removed 513 pages, groups and accounts tied to Iran and operating in Egypt, India, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Kashmir, Kazakhstan and various areas of the Middle East and North Africa.\n\nSimilar to other manipulation campaigns, the users posed as locals and \"made-up media entities\" and posted news stories about topics including sanctions against Iran, tensions between India and Pakistan, issues in the Middle East and the crisis in Venezuela.\n\n\"Although the people behind this activity attempted to conceal their identities, our review linked these accounts to Iran,\" Gleicher said.\n\nAnother 1,907 accounts linked to Russia were also blocked. These sought to influence sentiment related to Ukrainian news and politics, the situation in Crimea and corruption.\n\nFacebook said 212 Facebook accounts originating in Macedonia and Kosovo were shut down for misrepresenting themselves as users in Australia, the United States and Britain and sharing content about politics, astrology, celebrities and beauty tips.\n\nEarlier this month, Facebook said it blocked online manipulation efforts in Britain and Romania from users seeking to spread hate speech and divisive comments.\n\nIn January, Facebook took down hundreds of accounts from Iran that were part of a vast manipulation campaign operating in more than 20 countries.\n\nExplore further Facebook blocks manipulation efforts in Britain, Romania\n\n\u00a9 2019 AFP",

    "title": "U.S. pulling last of its embassy personnel from Venezuela",
    "description": "Move comes as blackout continues and desperation spreads across much of nation in grips of political crisis and hyperinflation",
    "text": "Caracas, Venezuela -- The United States announced late Monday that it's pulling the remaining staff from its embassy in Venezuela, citing the deteriorating situation in the South American nation.\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the decision as Venezuela struggled to restore electricity following four days of blackouts around the country in the midst of a deepening political crisis.\n\nVenezuela's congress declared a \"state of alarm\" Monday due to the blackout, the Reuters news agency reports. Venezuela also suspended school and business activities, officials said, the third time that's happened since the power grid went down last week.\n\nThe U.S. has led an international effort to oust socialist President Nicolas Maduro and replace him with opposition leader Juan Guaido, who vows to hold a new presidential election. Guaido is backed by some 50 countries, while Maduro maintains support from countries such as China, Russia and Cuba.\n\nMaduro had ordered all U.S. diplomats to leave Venezuela in late January because of its support of Guaido, but he retreated and allowed them to stay. The U.S. still withdrew dependents of embassy personnel as well as some of the staff. Pompeo said the remaining diplomats would be out of Venezuela by the end of the week.\n\nVenezuela deports American journalist Cody Weddle back to U.S.\n\nThe move came after another day of chaos as power outages that began Thursday evening continued to cause problems for Venezuelans, leaving them with little power, water and communications.\n\nPeople converged on a polluted river to fill water bottles in Caracas and scattered protests erupted in several cities\n\nA 3-year-old girl with a brain tumor languished in a Caracas hospital awaiting treatment after doctors started surgery but then suspended the operation when nationwide power outages first hit on Thursday, said the girl's fearful mother, who only gave her first name, Yalimar.\n\n\"The doctors told me that there are no miracles,\" said Yalimar, who hopes her daughter can be transferred Tuesday to one of the few hospitals in Venezuela that would be able to finish the complex procedure.\n\nThe girl's story highlighted an unfolding horror in Venezuela, where years of hardship got abruptly worse after the power grid collapsed.\n\nOn Monday, long lines of cars waited at the few gasoline stations with electricity and hospitals cared for many patients without power. Generators have alleviated conditions for some of the critically ill.\n\nMaduro said on national television Monday night that progress had been made in restoring electricity in Venezuela. He also said two people who were allegedly trying to sabotage power facilities were captured and were providing information to authorities, though he gave no details.\n\nVenezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 plans to take over as president when he returns\n\nGuaido, who heads the opposition-controlled congress, and the United States say Maduro's claims that the U.S. sabotaged the power grid with a \"cyberattack\" are an attempt to divert attention from the government's own failings.\n\nThere have been acts of kindness during Venezuela's crisis: People whose food would rot in refrigerators without power donated it to a restaurant, which cooked it for distribution to charities and hospitals.\n\nThe blackouts also have hit the oil industry. The country hasn't shipped $358 million in oil since the power failures started, and \"the whole system is grinding to a halt,\" said Russ Dallen, a Miami-based partner at the brokerage firm Caracas Capital Markets.\n\nTwo large tankers sat empty at the Jose offshore oil-loading dock, and at least 19 other ships were waiting their turns there, Dallen said.\n\nEngineers have restored power in some parts of Venezuela, but it often goes out again. There have been a few protests in Caracas and reports of similar anti-government anger elsewhere. Guaido tweeted about reports of looting in some cities, but details were difficult to confirm.\n\nSecurity forces in the city of Maracaibo dispersed \"criminals\" trying to take advantage of the power cuts, Mayor Willy Casanova told local media. However, numerous videos posted on social media that purported to be from Maracaibo showed crowds roaming the streets and people running from looted, damaged buildings with no police in sight.\n\nIn Caracas, some people reported more sightings of \"colectivos,\" a term for armed groups allegedly operating on behalf of the state to intimidate opponents.\n\nThe mood in Caracas was desperate.\n\nMarian Morales, a nurse working for a Catholic youth group, and several colleagues handed out diapers and food from a car parked near a hospital. Police and men in civilian clothing ordered them to leave, saying they didn't have permission to be there.\n\nMorales said the needy are cautious about approaching to collect the handouts because of the presence of security forces.\n\nEarly Monday, an explosion rocked a power station in the Baruta area of Caracas. Residents gathered to look at the charred, smoldering equipment.\n\nGuaido said three of four electricity transformers servicing the area were knocked out. He has blamed the blackouts on government corruption and mismanagement.\n\nWinston Cabas, the head of Venezuela's electrical engineers union, which opposes the government, disputed government allegations that the country's main hydroelectric dam was sabotaged last week. He blamed a lack of maintenance as well as the departure of skilled workers from the troubled country over the years.\n\n\"The system is vulnerable, fragile and unstable,\" he said.\n\nSpain's airline pilots union asked for Spanish airline Air Europa to stop flying to Venezuela after one of its crews was attacked at gunpoint in Caracas. The Sepla union said two pilots and eight more crew members of a flight from Madrid were assaulted on Saturday while going from the airport to their hotel in the Venezuelan capital. None of the crew members was injured.\n\nAir Europa responded by ordering the crews of flights to Venezuela to not spend the night in the country, according to the union.\n\nThe Trump administration imposed sanctions on a Moscow-based bank jointly owned by Russian and Venezuelan state-owned companies, alleging it tried to circumvent U.S. sanctions on the South American country. The U.S. said it is targeting Evrofinance Mosnarbank for supporting Petroleos de Venezuela SA, the state oil company previously targeted by sanctions in January.\n\nEvrofinance said it was carrying out its activities normally despite the announcement and pledged to \"meet its obligations to the clients and partners in full.\"\n\nThe U.S. and the other governments that recognize Guaido as Venezuela's interim president say Maduro wasn't legitimately re-elected last year because opposition candidates weren't permitted to run. Maduro says he is the target of a U.S. coup plot.",

    "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Want to receive this post in your inbox every day? Sign up for the Balance of Power newsletter, and follow Bloomberg Politics on Twitter and Facebook for more.\n\nAn eight-month trade war looks like it\u2019s finally nearing an end, and not necessarily because China is ready to bow to U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s demands.\n\nBoth sides are close to a deal that could lift most or all U.S. tariffs if Beijing follows through on pledges ranging from better protecting intellectual-property rights to buying a significant amount of American products, Jenny Leonard reports.\n\nTrump and President Xi Jinping each have an incentive to avoid further tariff increases that may hurt the global economy. Xi doesn\u2019t want to see job losses that could undermine the Communist Party\u2019s legitimacy, while Trump has linked his success to the economy and stock-market gains.\n\nThe question now is whether Trump will lift penalties right away as China would like, or listen to trade hawks in his administration who want them in place until U.S. demands are met on structural reforms such as government support for state-run companies.\n\nFor Trump, any decision is a bet on his 2020 election campaign strategy. Given how global markets jumped today on optimism of a deal, Xi could walk away relatively unscathed.\n\nGlobal Headlines\n\nA star is born? | House Judiciary Chairman Jerrold Nadler might be about to become a household name. The veteran New York City lawmaker \u2013 whose committee would run any impeachment proceedings \u2013 plans to lodge a sweeping document request today, part of what he described as an aggressive investigation into whether there\u2019s evidence of wrongdoing by Trump. He could be aided by the submission \u2013 possibly within days \u2013 of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's long-awaited report on alleged Russian election meddling.\n\nChris Strohm and Larry Liebert look at the explosive chain of events Mueller's report could kick off.\n\nMessaging bills | House Democrats are using their majority to push gun-control, campaign-finance and voting-rights legislation. Senate Republicans are advancing abortion restrictions while trying to put the Democrats on the spot with a vote on climate change. None of the proposals stand a chance in a divided Congress. Instead, they're meant to corner the opposing party with tough votes that could be used against them in 2020 campaigns, Laura Litvan and Anna Edgerton write.\n\nReturning challenger | National Assembly leader Juan Guaido, who is leading a campaign to remove President Nicolas Maduro, said he will return to Venezuela today for anti-government protests. The move could dramatically raise the stakes in his standoff with Maduro, who has threatened to arrest him for violating a travel ban. U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton warned any move against Guaido would trigger \u201ca strong and significant response.\u201d\n\nBrexit boost | Prime Minister Theresa May rolled out a $2.1 billion spending infusion for poorer areas of the U.K., a measure immediately attacked as an attempt to buy support from opposition Labour politicians whose support May likely will need to get her agreement with Brussels ratified. The plan may have already backfired; many lawmakers pointed out that the funding boost is far less than districts have lost from austerity since the financial crisis.\n\nMixed messages | South Korean President Moon Jae-in praised Pyongyang's offer to dismantle a key nuclear production complex as an \u201cirreversible\u201d step to curb its weapons program. The endorsement represents a break with the Trump administration, which said the proposal wasn't enough to justify sanctions relief. The schism comes as the president blamed House Democrats for contributing to his decision last week to abandon talks with Kim Jong Un by summoning his former lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen to testify.\n\nWhat to watch:\n\nRepublican Senator Rand Paul said he\u2019ll vote to block Trump\u2019s declaration of a national emergency on the U.S.-Mexico border, a move that\u2019s likely to provide enough votes for the measure to pass the Senate in the coming days and draw Trump\u2019s first veto. Estonia\u2019s opposition Reform Party will lead talks on forming a new government after upsetting Prime Minister Juri Ratas's Center Party in yesterday's elections and dodging a challenge from populists who\u2019d threatened to shake up the political landscape of another European Union state. Algerians poured into the streets to protest last night's announcement by their octogenarian president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, that he's planning to run in next month's elections in a bid to win a fifth and final term.",

    "text": "(Bloomberg) -- With Venezuelans suffering from several days of electricity outages, National Assembly leader Juan Guaido said he\u2019ll call a \u201cnational emergency\u201d on Monday to rally public anger in his bid to oust President Nicolas Maduro.\n\nThough he\u2019s backed by the U.S. and 50 other governments, Guaido\u2019s leverage is limited because he doesn\u2019t control the government or the all-important military. His plan is to increase pressure on Maduro, who he says stole last year\u2019s election and therefore has no legitimacy.\n\nGuaido stressed he wasn\u2019t calling for international intervention, even though some supporters are pressing him to do so. Instead, the 35-year-old leader made another plea to the military to ditch Maduro, a change that would almost certainly bring him down.\n\n\u201cWill you keep hiding the dictator?\u201d he asked in a news conference in Caracas, addressing the military high command. To all soldiers, he said: \u201cWe do not want more accomplices. The time is now.\u201d\n\nFallen Nation\n\nOnce South America\u2019s richest nation, Venezuela has suffered deeply under Maduro. The nation\u2019s problems encompass poverty, violence, hyperinflation, food shortages and now the worst lack of electricity in memory, knocked out on Thursday. In a possible clue to Maduro\u2019s tenuous hold on power, he hasn\u2019t arrested Guaido despite threats to do so.\n\nAt Caracas University Hospital in the capital, Maria Valor sat watch Sunday over the bed of her 3-year-old daughter, struck in the head by a fallen branch. Her face was swollen and purple rings circled her eyes. \u201cShe won\u2019t respond,\" Valor said. \u201cShe won\u2019t sit up and no one is able to tell me what is wrong without an X-ray.\u201d\n\nBut there was no electricity, and one of two of the hospital\u2019s generators had broken.\n\nThere has been no independent explanation for the power outages, though many Venezuelans suspect it\u2019s simply part of the country\u2019s long deterioration. Maduro\u2019s government has alleged cyber-sabotage and sought to blame the U.S. Defense Minister Vladmir Padrino Lopez said on state television Sunday that the government has \"achieved some level of stabilization\" in the power shortages.\n\n\u201cThere is still a lot to do because the attack has been very precise,\u201d he said.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s dire moment is playing out in ways large and small. Some 80 percent of the nation was unable to get online Sunday, according to NetBlocks, an organization that monitors cybersecurity and freedom on the internet. Barricades were erected on some of the capital\u2019s streets overnight, along with burning refuse on the streets, after both Guaido and Maduro rounded up supporters for rallies on Saturday.\n\nHospital Deaths\n\nJulio Castro, the head of Doctors for Health, a network of medical providers that surveys Venezuela\u2019s hospitals, said that 17 people with long-term diseases had died since the blackouts started on Thursday. They couldn\u2019t get the treatment they needed, he said.\n\nYet the nation seems to adjust to each new crisis. Though many regular businesses were closed, the bars and restaurants of the wealthier east rollicked on Saturday night as if the darkness signaled a holiday.\n\nWhile the wealthy were able to maintain some semblance of normality, other Venezuelans were left to their own devices to face life without electricity. Motorists have taken to driving around aimlessly to charge phones and attempt to call loved ones in the countryside or abroad. Highways and avenues were lined with parked cars where the signal was particularly strong. There have been isolated incidents looting in Caracas over Saturday and Sunday, but it has not spread across the city.\n\nOn Sunday morning the city\u2019s downtown came back to life after a night marked by residents burning trash and hurling bottles at police, who quashed the demonstrations with tear gas. Roads in the La Candelaria neighborhood were singed from the skirmishes, but kiosks and bakeries were open and old men played dominoes in plazas and churches held Mass.\n\nMaria Martelo, 27, an engineer, returned to her powerless home from a cathedral where she had charged her phone. \u201cWhat else can you do?\u201d she said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re living is terrible and absurd.\u201d\n\n(Adds color in third paragraph after \"Hospital Deaths\" subhead.)\n\n--With assistance from Patricia Laya and Fabiola Zerpa.\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Andrew Rosati in Caracas at arosati3@bloomberg.net;Alex Vasquez in Caracas Office at avasquez45@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: James Ludden at jludden@bloomberg.net, Tony Czuczka, Ian Fisher\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.",

    "description": "White House to announce new sanctions on Cuba over Maduro support, source says Fox News US ramps up Venezuela sanctions as Guaido tours South America | Al Jazeera English Al Jazeera English Guaid\u00f3 Vows Prompt Return to Venezuela as Absence Saps Opposition\u2019s M\u2026",
    "text": "The White House will soon impose major new sanctions against the Cuban government over its support for the regime of contested Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a source familiar with President Trump's national security team told Fox News.\n\nThe White House announced sweeping sanctions against Maduro's government in January, and in a fiery anti-socialism address last month, Trump linked Cuba and Venezuela's fortunes: \"The days of socialism and communism are numbered not only in Venezuela, but in Nicaragua and Cuba as well,\" Trump said, as the crowd roared. \"Do we love Cuba? Do we love Nicaragua? Great countries. Great potential.\"\n\nOPINION: CUBA WILL BREAK YOUR HEART\n\nThe move against Cuba -- which Trump has accused of propping up Maduro as a puppet -- would be an application of the Helms-Burton Act, Fox News is told. That 1996 law includes a provision that, if activated, would permit Cuban Americans who are U.S. citizens to file lawsuits against both foreign corporations and individuals concerning property seized by the Cuban government, including during the 1959 Cuban Revolution led by Fidel Castro.\n\nThe Title III provisions of Helms-Burton have been waived by every administration, but the Trump administration in January opted only to suspend its terms for 45 days, rather than the normal six-month period that previous administrations have repeatedly invoked.\n\nCUBAN GUARDS SURROUNDING MADURO, US MILITARY COMMANDER SAYS\n\n\u201cThis extension will permit us to conduct a careful review of the right to bring action under Title III in light of the national interests of the United States and efforts to expedite a transition to democracy in Cuba,\" the State Department said. \"We encourage any person doing business in Cuba to reconsider whether they are trafficking in confiscated property and abetting this dictatorship.\u201d\n\nIn response, Cuban Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez characterized the Trump administration's move on Twitter as \"political blackmail\u201d and a \u201cbrutal attack against international law.\u201d\n\nIn February, Navy Adm. Craig S. Faller, commander of U.S. Southern Command, testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Thursday that Maduro, fearing for his own safety, has \u201ccompletely surround[ed]\u201d himself with Cuban security.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s a good sense of where the loyalty of the Venezuelan people are, that his immediate security force is made up of Cubans,\u201d Faller told the committee.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton, R- Ark., apparently surprised by the testimony, asked how many of these Secret Service-style guards Maduro has in the country.\n\nThe answer: \u201cI don\u2019t have that number\u201d but \u201cI\u2019d say there are many.\u201d\n\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFaller added that Russia and China have been involved in what intelligence officials say are measures to support Maduro\u2019s regime. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen reporting of Russian security forces being flown in,\u201d he said. \u201cChina\u2019s not been helpful in a diplomatic way. I\u2019ll leave that to the diplomats, but China\u2019s in there and they\u2019re involved in cyber ways that are not helpful to a democratic outcome.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, nearly 87 percent of Cuban voters approved a new constitution that preserves the island's single-party Socialist system and centrally planned economy while updating some financial, electoral and criminal laws, authorities there said in late February. The margin of victory was relatively low for a country where opposition parties and campaigns are illegal and official proposals routinely receive higher than 90 percent approval.\n\nThe U.S., which has recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as interim president of Venezuela, has sent aid to Venezuela despite Maduro\u2019s refusal to accept it. Late last month, Maduro-backed troops blocked the aid convoys at the border and fired tear gas on protesters in clashes that left two people dead and some 300 injured, as Maduro insisted the aid was a ploy by the U.S. to undermine his leadership.\n\n\"How many of you national guardsmen have a sick mother? How many have kids in school without food,\" Guaido said, standing alongside a warehouse in the Colombian city of Cucuta where 600 tons of mostly U.S.-supplied boxes of food and medicine have been stockpiled. \"You don't owe any obedience to a sadist...who celebrates the denial of humanitarian aid the country needs.\"\n\nThe Trump administration imposed sanctions Friday on six high-ranking members of the Venezuelan security forces and revoked the visas of other officials and their relatives over the aid blockade.\n\nThe measures were the latest by the Trump administration to increase the international pressure on Maduro, whose re-election last year is seen as illegitimate, to resign and turn power over to Guaido, who has been recognized by the U.S. and 50 other government as interim president.\n\nThe State Department later said that the U.S. had revoked the visas of 49 people, making them subject to deportation if they are in the country. It placed an unspecified number of others on a visa restriction list.\n\nFox News' Paulina Dedaj and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

REUTERS/Carlos Garcia Rawlins/File Photo\n\nThe report\u2019s findings contrast with comments from President Nicolas Maduro, who has said there is no crisis and no need for humanitarian aid, blaming U.S. sanctions for the country\u2019s economic problems.\n\nThe United Nations has found itself stuck in the middle of the political struggle that pits Maduro against U.S.-backed opposition leader Juan Guaido, who invoked the constitution to assume an interim presidency in January, arguing that Maduro\u2019s 2018 re-election was illegitimate.\n\nLast month, Venezuelan government troops blocked U.S.-backed aid convoys entering from Colombia and Brazil.\n\nHowever, Maduro\u2019s government has accepted aid from ally Russia.\n\n\u201cThe politicization of humanitarian assistance in the context of the crisis makes delivery of assistance in accordance with the principles of neutrality, impartiality and independence more difficult,\u201d reads the 45-page U.N. \u201cOverview of Priority Humanitarian Needs\u201d in Venezuela.\n\nVenezuela\u2019s information ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe March 2019 U.N. review uses a \u201cbroad range\u201d of sources - including U.N. agencies, the Red Cross, academia and civil society - and is part of a push by the world body to try and scale up its humanitarian response in Venezuela.\n\n\u201cMuch more action is required to meet the growing needs of the Venezuelan people,\u201d reads the report, which warned that a lack of reliable, official data made it difficult to accurately determine the scope of need.\n\nIt estimates 94 percent of the 28.8 million people live in poverty, while some 3.4 million people have fled, with a further 1.9 million expected to follow in this year.\n\n\u201cDue to an increasingly contracted economy and political unrest, the Venezuelan population is facing unprecedented challenges in accessing essential services, including protection, healthcare, medicines, vaccinations, water, electricity, education and access to food,\u201d the report said.\n\nThere are an estimated 2.8 million people in need when it comes to healthcare, according to the U.N. review, including some 300,000 people whose lives are at risk because they have been unable to access medicines or treatment for diseases like cancer, diabetes and HIV for more than a year.\n\n\u201cPreventable diseases such as tuberculosis, diphtheria, measles and malaria have resurfaced in the country and are on the rise, as is hepatitis A, due to the lack of access to safe drinking water,\u201d the report said.\n\nIn the area of water, sanitation and hygiene, 4.3 million people are in need of help, according to the report.\n\nIt said a shortage of food had left some 1.9 million people in nutrition need, while an increase in violence in the country meant some 2.7 million Venezuelans were vulnerable.\n\nSome 1.2 million children are not in school due to the crisis, the report said, because many families cannot afford the clothing, footwear or transportation required and children are instead working to help pay for their family\u2019s essential needs. Another 1 million were found to be highly vulnerable to dropping out of school.",

Total EU assistance for the regional crisis now stands at \u20ac117.6 million since 2018. High Representative/Vice-President Federica Mogherini said: \u201cThe European Union stays at the forefront of the international mobilisation to support the Venezuelan people.

The EU's achievements are numerous and the discharge exercise gives us yet another opportunity to look at them. Looking ahead, the next long-term EU budget for the 2021-2027 is the next big opportunity to show that we are learning from the past. In its proposal, the Commission has put forward ideas how to make sure the EU budget generates an even greater added value for the EU citizens, while being more flexible and simpler. We are now working hand in hand with the European Parliament and the Council towards timely adoption of the various proposals, including the 37 specific spending programmes, so that beneficiaries from across the Union will be able to benefit from EU funding as of January 2021.\u201d More information is available in the press statementhere.(For more information: Alexander Winterstein \u2013 Tel.: +32 229 93265; Andreana Stankova \u2013 Tel.: +32 229 57857)\n\nReducing risks in the Banking Union: Commission welcomes agreement by Member States on new measures to reduce high stocks of non-performing loans\n\nThe European Commission welcomes the agreement reached among EU Member States today on new rules to develop secondary markets for sales of non-performing loans (NPLs) while maintaining a high level of borrower protection. NPLs are loans where the borrower - either a company or a physical person - is not able to repay a bank loan. As part of the Commission's effortsto deliver on the Council's Action Plan to tackle NPLs in Europe, the new measures will encourage the development of a secondary market where banks can sell their NPLs to credit servicers and investors, thereby contributing to a reduction in high stocks of NPLs in the EU, a remaining legacy risk from the financial crisis. This is essential for the financial stability of the EU and it is a crucial factor for completing the Banking Union. Today's agreement was reached by EU Permanent Representatives at their meeting this morning in Brussels. Valdis Dombrovskis, Vice-President responsible for Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union said: \"Today's agreement is a further step towards reducing non-performing loans in Europe and increasing the resilience of the European banking sector. I am counting on swift progress on the discussions of our proposed rules in the European Parliament. These rules allow us to progress towards reinforcing the Economic and Monetary Union\". The Directive introduces a harmonised and less restrictive regime for credit purchasers and servicers and removes undue impediments to cross-border activity, while ensuring that the same level of consumer protection is maintained when a loan is sold by a bank. While today's agreement is an important step forward, progress has been regrettably slower on complementary elements of the Directive that would increase the efficiency of enforcement regimes. Further work and discussion on these elements will be needed and should be prioritised in the next legislative cycle. But given the urgent need to foster development of a well-functioning secondary market for NPLs, the draft rules approved by Member States today should still be finalised in the current legislative cycle.

InvestEU builds on the success of the Juncker Plan, or Investment Plan for Europe and will bring together under one roof the European Fund for Strategic Investments and 13 other EU financial instruments currently supporting investment in the EU, making the financing easier to access. Similar to the Juncker Plan, InvestEU is an EU budget guarantee. The guarantee will be \u20ac38 billion, set to mobilise at least \u20ac650 billion in total investment. The InvestEU Fund will be accompanied by the InvestEU Advisory Hub \u2013 tailored support to project promoters \u2013 and the InvestEU Portal \u2013 an easily accessible pipeline of mature projects for potential investors. InvestEU is a partnership with the European Investment Bank Group (EIB), the EU Bank, and will be open to other implementing partners as well. This preliminary agreement is still subject to formal approval by European Parliament and Council. The budgetary aspects of InvestEU are subject to the overall agreement on the next long-term EU budget, which the Commission proposed in May 2018. As of March 2019, the Juncker Plan had mobilised almost \u20ac390 billion in additional investment across Europe and supported 929,000 SMEs.

    "title": "Venezuela blackouts: Maduro blames the US, but is it possible?",
    "description": "Venezuela is suffering its second major electricity blackout in a month, prompting more accusations from President Nicolas Maduro that the US government has had a hand in the crisis \u2014 but is there anything to the accusation? Read Full Article at RT.com",
    "text": "Venezuela is suffering its second major electricity blackout in a month, prompting more accusations from President Nicolas Maduro that the US government has had a hand in the crisis \u2014 but is there anything to the accusation?\n\nMaduro has consistently blamed foreign \u201csaboteurs and terrorists\u201d for the crippling blackouts which have forced stores, businesses and schools to close and left the streets of Caracas empty as people head indoors before sundown.\n\nMeanwhile, self-declared interim president Juan Guaido has blamed the outages on Maduro, whose policies, he said, have allowed the country's infrastructure to crumble to breaking point.\n\nEarlier this month, independent website the Grayzone reported on a 2010 memo, which it called a US government \"regime change blueprint\" for Venezuela, back when Washington was trying to foment a coup against former Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez. The document, originally made public by WikiLeaks, was put together by Srdja Popovic at a Belgrade-based US government-funded \"democracy promotion\" organization called the Center for Applied Non-Violent Action and Strategies (CANVAS) \u2013 and it provides some insight into the claim that the US has played a role in the blackouts.\n\nAlso on rt.com Venezuela\u2019s oil production in jeopardy after new blackout\n\nThe 2010 document states that the collapse of Venezuela's electrical sector could serve as a \"watershed event\" in \"galvanizing public unrest\" in a way that \"no opposition group could ever hope to generate.\" However, \u201can opposition group would be best served to take advantage of the situation and spin it against Chavez and towards their needs,\u201d the memo said.\n\nThe CANVAS organization is also particularly relevant to the current situation in Venezuela, since, according to previous Grayzone reporting, the group led revolution \u201ctraining sessions\u201d with Guaido as far back as 2007.\n\nThe Venezuelan blackouts continue but don't just assume that their electric grid is failing right now because of Chavista incompetence.\n\nThe US is involved in a regime change operation and there's a paper trail indicating that this is part of the plan. https://t.co/OweODcWkuZ \u2014 Lee Camp [Redacted] (@LeeCamp) March 27, 2019\n\nThe document even pinpointed the location where such an electricity disaster might take place \u2014 the Simon Bolivar Hydroelectric Plant at the Guri dam \u2014 the very place where a major failure caused the recent blackouts, which Maduro blamed on a US cyber attack. The second blackout, which happened this week, was apparently caused by a fire at the same plant. Photographs posted online showed the extensive damage that was done to the facility by the fire, which was blamed by Maduro on \"criminals\" and \"terrorists.\u201d A third blackout left a majority of Venezuelans without internet access on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cFlash forward to March 2019, and the scenario outlined by Popovic [in the memo] is playing out almost exactly as he had imagined,\u201d Max Blumenthal wrote at the Grayzone.\n\nAdding to the mystery, roughly 18 minutes after the first blackout happened on March 7, Florida Senator Marco Rubio announced via Twitter that \"backup generators have failed\" at the plant \u2014 before Venezuelan officials themselves even had the same information. \u201cHow did Marco Rubio know that backup generators had failed? At that time, no one knew that,\u201d Venezuelan Communications Minister Jorge Rodriguez asked.\n\nShortly before, regime-change enthusiast Rubio had also told the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on Venezuela that the country was about to \"enter a period of suffering no nation in our hemisphere has confronted in modern history.\"\n\nOf course, there is no proof that the US is behind the recent blackouts, but the document suggests that this exact scenario was mapped out by the US-funded CANVAS as being potentially hugely beneficial for regime change efforts.\n\nSo far, the document has been ignored by mainstream media, which has insisted that there is no indication of US involvement and implied that Maduro\u2019s finger-pointing is entirely baseless.\n\nOf course Reuters and the rest of the corporate media are not mentioning a key detail in their reports on Venezuela's blackout:\n\n\n\nThe US-funded group that trained Venezuela's coup leaders said in 2010 that electricity outages were a tactic they had in mindhttps://t.co/kaSHHjDKoK \u2014 Ben Norton (@BenjaminNorton) March 13, 2019\n\nLike this story?

    "text": "Oil prices rose on Friday, pushed up by ongoing supply cuts led by producer club OPEC and U.S. sanctions against Iran and Venezuela, which have given crude markets the biggest first quarter price push since 2009.\n\nAdvertising\n\nUS West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures were at $59.54 per barrel at 0100 GMT, up 24 cents, or 0.4 percent, from their last settlement.\n\nBrent crude oil futures had yet to trade.\n\nOil prices have been supported for much of 2019 by efforts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-affiliated allies like Russia, known as OPEC+, who have pledged to withhold around 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) of supply this year to prop up markets.\n\n\u201cProduction cuts from the OPEC+ group of producers have been the main reason for the dramatic recovery since the 38 percent price slump seen during the final quarter of last year,\u201d said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank.\n\nAdvertising\n\n\u201cIn fact, the recovery has been so strong and swift that WTI is currently heading towards its biggest quarterly gain \u2013 currently 32 percent \u2013 since Q2 2009, when the recovery from the global financial crisis saw it jump by more than 40 percent,\u201d he added.\n\nThe price surge triggered a call by U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday for OPEC to boost production to lower prices.\n\n\u201cVery important that OPEC increase the flow of Oil. World Markets are fragile, price of Oil getting too high. Thank you!\u201d Trump wrote in a post on Twitter.\n\nHowever, the OPEC+ cuts are not the only reason for rising oil prices this year, with analysts also pointing to U.S. sanctions on oil exporters and OPEC members Iran and Venezuela as reasons for the surge.\n\nSaxo Bank\u2019s Hansen said \u201cthe biggest short-term risk to the oil market is likely to be driven by renewed stock market weakness.\u201d\n\nStock markets have been volatile this year amid signs of a sharp global economic slowdown.\n\n\u201cBusiness confidence has weakened in recent months \u2026 (and) global manufacturing PMIs are about to move into contraction,\u201d Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a note, although it added that \u201cthe services sector \u2026 continues to expand unabated.\u201d\n\nGiven the OPEC+ cuts, however, Bank of America said it expected oil prices to rise in the short-term, with Brent prices forecast to average $74 per barrel in the second quarter.\n\nHeading towards 2020, however, the bank warned of a recession.\n\n\u201cWe are growing more concerned about the outlook for 2020. Manufacturing tends to lead consumer confidence \u2026 A deeper dive into protectionism could eventually kill burgeoning global consumer sentiment and trigger a global recession,\u201d it said.",

    "title": "Venezuelan Economist: Cryptocurrency Is \u2018Good\u2019 Money, Bolivars Are Not",
    "description": "The adoption of cryptocurrencies in Venezuela could contribute to economic recovery, argues one local economist.",
    "text": "The adoption of cryptocurrencies in Venezuela, first due to hyperinflation and later due to dollarization, could come to play a role in the country\u2019s economic rebuilding.\n\nAt least that\u2019s according to Venezuela\u2019s most outspoken economist on the subject of cryptocurrencies, professor Aaron Olmos, who dissected the reasons for his country\u2019s current dependency on the US dollar in a new interview with CoinDesk. A passionate advocate of the benefits of cryptocurrencies, Olmos has lectured about the technology for over two years, even leading a program focused on blockchain for IESA, the most prominent business college in the country.\n\nWith several publications, conferences and interviews in national television, the economist has demonstrated a passion for teaching the Venezuelan public about the crypto economy and the implications of its adoption.\n\nIn his new interview, Olmos discussed the challenges of the present economic situation, where a devalued Bolivar is used as an official currency, despite alternatives. In his opinion, this situation \u2013 a consequence of decades of poor economic administration \u2013 has lead to a crisis where the use of cryptocurrencies has been accelerating as the Bolivar\u2019s decline in value sharpens.\n\nHe told CoinDesk:\n\n\u201cWe are in a complicated situation because \u2018good money\u2019 \u2013 dollars or cryptocurrency \u2013 is available, but it is scarce because people tend to keep it, not spend it. On the other hand our \u2018bad money,\u2019 the Bolivar, it\u2019s the one used by law.\u201d\n\nAdded to this, the economist pointed out the fact that cash in high denominations is limited, while bills in low denominations with no acquisition power are issued by the central bank.\n\n\u201cThis creates a distortion in the price of goods and services since the production value is now based in dollars in the internal market,\u201d he explains. \u201cEverybody knows it: the Bolivar is our official currency in circulation, but the actual functional currency is the US dollar.\u201d\n\nCrypto as a solution\n\nYet, in the midst of this crisis, Olmos believes cryptocurrency could help form a solution, in part, because adoption \u201cis already happening.\u201d\n\nAlong with the reactivation of production and the creation of new sources of investment, the answer to the country\u2019s economic issues could be introducing a double circulation system, similar to the one used in Brazil to overcome its rampant inflation in the 1990s, the Unit of Real Value (URV).\n\nThis way, the cryptocurrency would carry part of the burden in commerce and share it with the Bolivar.\n\n\u201cGiven the conditions were we need an alternative element of trust, there\u2019s nothing better than a cryptocurrency while an economic policy takes care of making the Bolivar regain value and recover its power,\u201d Olmos said.\n\nOlmos went on to indicate that he does not believe current laws in the Venezuelan Constitution exclude the possibility of using a cryptocurrency for payments as part of a readjustment plan.\n\n\u201cWhat should be done is to recognize its use and give it some space for development for it to work properly and temporarily,\u201d the economist said, emphasizing the ultimate goal would be to boost the Bolivar\u2019s value. \u201cWe could even use it in a digital form.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about the possible inclusion of the Petro as part of a recovery plan, the economist denies it outright, adding: \u201cThe Petro hasn\u2019t worked out because it has a structure based on intervention, power concentration, and forced usage.\u201d\n\nTwo visions of one country\n\nOf course, the outcome will be defined by who will make the reins of Venezuela\u2019s future. As Olmos puts it: \u201cFrom Jan. 10, we have two visions of the same country.\u201d\n\nAs the economist recounts, there\u2019s an economic plan for 2019 \u2013 2025 that theoretically includes blockchain and cryptocurrency. \u201cBut this document hasn\u2019t been published nor seen by anyone,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the other hand, it\u2019s unclear what position will be taken, as the administration in charge, run by the National Assembly\u2019s President, Juan Guaid\u00f3, hasn\u2019t issued further opinions about crypto within the context of their plans for Venezuela\u2019s recovery.\n\nAaron Olmos image via Instagram",

That was a 4 percent increase from the year before.\n\n- The previous peak was in 2007, so it took until last year to bring consumption levels back to the pre-recession peak.\n\n- Weather is a key factor. The higher levels in 2018 are largely due to a hot summer and cold winter.\n\nMarket Movers\n\n- Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE: RDS.A) signed two offshore exploration contracts with the Colombian government. If it moves forward, Shell could spend as much as $650 million in exploration.\n\n- Petrobras (NYSE: PBR) announced another $8.1 billion in planned cuts to operational costs through 2023.

Saudi Arabia plans to keep oil production below 10 mb/d in April, extending its deeper-than-required cuts for another month. The move highlights Riyadh\u2019s desire to rapidly drain inventories and boost prices.\n\nRelated: Oil Prices Rise As Saudis Curb Exports\n\nVenezuela blackout disrupts oil exports. A widespread electricity blackout in Venezuela disrupted oil operations, impacting both production and exports. Data is opaque at this time, but Venezuela\u2019s oil exports could be headed for a freefall. Energy Aspects estimates output may have temporarily plunged to as low as 500,000 bpd, or half the output level from January.\n\nCitgo and Valero try to return oil shipments to Venezuela. Due to U.S. sanctions, Citgo and Valero (NYSE: VLO) are trying to send back oil cargoes to Venezuela. In total, more than 6 million barrels of oil are in limbo, Reuters reports.\n\nU.S. presses India to stop buying oil from Venezuela. American officials are pressuring India to stop importing oil from Venezuela. \u201cWe say you should not be helping this regime. You should be on the side of the Venezuelan people,\u201d Elliott Abrams, Trump\u2019s point man on Venezuela, told Reuters in an interview. The U.S. has sent signals that it is considering \u201csecondary sanctions,\u201d in which it would target foreign banks who do business with Venezuela. A similar approach has been crucial in increasing pressure on countries not to do business with Iran.\n\nOil and gas sector facing \u201ccrisis of confidence. The oil and gas sector is suffering from a \u201ccrisis of confidence,\u201d according to Equinor (EQNR) CEO Eldar S\u00e6tre. Climate change and society\u2019s lack of trust in the industry on environmental issues poses a long-term threat. \"We are collectively not doing enough,\" S\u00e6tre said. He called on others to lower emissions and become more transparent. Equinor, for instance, invests heavily in renewable energy.

    "text": "The city of 1.9 million is also nicknamed \"red Vienna\" for having long been run by the political left, with cheap public services and abundant social housing\n\nVIENNA, March 13 (Reuters) - The Austrian capital Vienna has topped Mercer's index of most liveable cities for the 10th year in a row.\n\nKnown by tourists for its imperial past, gilded palaces and classical music, the city of 1.9 million is also nicknamed \"red Vienna\" for having long been run by the political left, with cheap public services and abundant social housing.\n\nBeing medium-sized, safe and relatively green are some of the features it shares with second-placed Zurich, a much more expensive city and major financial centre, as well as with Auckland, Munich and Vancouver, which came joint third.\n\nThose top five cities in consulting firm Mercer's 2019 Quality of Living Ranking published on Wednesday were unchanged from last year's edition, though Vancouver rose to joint third from fifth.\n\n\"Quality of living is determined by many factors, from access to public transport and traffic congestion levels, to the availability of housing and international schools, to a city's cultural scene,\" Mercer said in a statement, without specifying how Vienna keeps edging out Zurich.\n\nMercer says it looks at 39 factors grouped under 10 headings such as \"political and social environment\" and \"recreation\".\n\nThe 10 cities at the bottom of the 231-city table were unchanged, with Baghdad ranked last, followed by Bangui in the Central African Republic and Yemen's capital Sanaa.\n\nThere were few big shifts but Caracas fell nine places to 202nd as Venezuela has suffered from hyperinflation, a shortage of basic goods and, more recently, a political crisis since opposition leader Juan Guaido assumed the interim presidency in January.\n\nMercer said Caracas \"saw living standards drop following significant political and economic instability\".\n\nIts index, however, was based on data analysed between September and November 2018, meaning it did not take into account recent developments such as a massive blackout that has crippled oil exports and made already scarce food rot.\n\nBrexit did not cause major movements among British cities. London remained the highest-ranked overall at 44th despite coming last in Britain in a separate personal safety ranking.\n\n\"In the UK, London remains ... the preferred centre for international business,\" Mercer said.\n\nDublin, which was ranked safer than any British city, rose one spot to 33rd overall, just above San Francisco.\n\n\"Dublin ... has been the net beneficiary of tech, financial services and law firms relocating to the city,\" Mercer said, without elaborating.\n\n(Reporting by Francois Murphy Editing by Alexandra Hudson)\n\nOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.",

    "text": "(Bloomberg) -- OPEC officials sat down to dinner with senior executives from North America\u2019s booming shale oil industry on the sidelines of CERAWeek by IHS Markit, the annual gathering in Houston of some of the energy industry\u2019s biggest names.\n\nOn the first day of the week-long event, topics of discussion included geopolitics, environmental regulations and Royal Dutch Shell Plc\u2019s hunt for acquisitions in the biggest U.S. shale oil field.\n\nTime stamps are Houston.\n\nOil Still Main Driver of OPEC Economies: Barkindo (7:01 p.m.)\n\nEven as OPEC members seek to diversify their economies, Mohammad Barkindo, secretary general of the cartel, noted that oil production \u201cwill continue to be the dominant source of not only energy but also revenue.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, International Energy Agency Executive Director Fatih Birol noted that electric vehicles are not yet a huge threat to oil demand.\n\nRebalancing Market a \u2018Work in Progress\u2019: Barkindo (6:04 p.m.)\n\nBringing oil supply and demand back into equilibrium remains a \u201cwork in progress,\u201d Barkindo said.\n\n\u201cWe are getting there,\u201d the IEA\u2019s Birol said as he and Barkindo shared the stage with industry historian Daniel Yergin.\n\nShell Sees Permian Output Growing by 30% Annually (4:39 p.m.)\n\nShell will grow production from its existing Permian Basin assets, which currently produce about 145,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, by about 30 percent a year for the foreseeable future, Gretchen Watkins, its U.S. president, said in an interview.\n\nCash flow from shale assets, which includes fields in Canada and Argentina, will reach $1 billion to $2 billion by 2021, she said.\n\nOPEC to Break Bread With Shale Competitors (4:04 p.m.)\n\nThe dinner meeting between OPEC officials and shale drillers is due to take place Monday night, Barkindo said in an interview with Bloomberg News. It will be the third consecutive year that rival producers have gathered on the sidelines of CERAWeek. The event has become an informal communication channel between the cartel and fast-growing shale producers.\n\nThe dinner will follow an afternoon gathering behind closed doors of OPEC officials and some of the leading lights of American finance, including Michael O\u2019Dwyer, a senior natural resources banker at Morgan Stanley.\n\nIndia Warning Companies Away From Venezuelan Oil (3:39 p.m.)\n\nThe Indian government is warning companies to halt purchases of Venezuelan oil or face undisclosed consequences, said M.M. Kutty, the nation\u2019s secretary of petroleum and natural gas.\n\nShell Says It Can Be World\u2019s Top Power Producer (3:09 p.m.)\n\nShell plans to become the world\u2019s biggest power company despite electricity\u2019s historically narrow margins.\n\nThe world\u2019s second-largest oil explorer by market value is spending up to $2 billion a year on its \u2018new energies\u2019 division, mainly to grow in a power sector it envisions delivering 8 percent to 12 percent annual returns, according to Maarten Wetselaar, director of Shell\u2019s integrated gas new energies unit.\n\n\u201cWe believe we can be the largest electricity power company in the world in the early 2030s,\u201d Wetselaar said in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Monday. \u201cWe are not interested in the power business because we like what we saw in the last 20 years. We are interested because we think we like what we see in the next 20 years.\u201d\n\nPemex\u2019s Top Execs Skip CERAWeek Conference (2:45 p.m.)\n\nPetroleos Mexicanos Chief Executive Officer Octavio Romero and his finance chief, Alberto Velazquez, won\u2019t attend CERAWeek, according to a company representative who asked not to be identified, citing internal policy. No additional details were disclosed.\n\nEPA To Sign E15 Proposal This Week, Wheeler Says (2:41 p.m.)\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency expects to ratify a new rule governing ethanol use in gasoline this week, Acting Administrator Andrew Wheeler said during a meeting with reporters.\n\nWheeler said he also hopes to have small-refinery exemptions to the new rule out in the next week or two.\n\nPerry Sees Venezuela Worsening Until Regime Ends (1:42 p.m.)\n\nU.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry said the decline of oil output from Venezuela will continue until there\u2019s a change of leadership.\n\nThe International Energy Agency said Monday it expects Venezuelan output to fall to 800,000 barrels a day this year. Power outages in the nation have slowed production that was already stunted in the aftermath of U.S. sanctions on Petroleos de Venezuela SA, the state-owned oil company.\n\nStory continues",

    "title": "Power out, water scarce, looting: Venezuela in crisis. Will Trump administration react?",
    "description": "Democrats in Congress are readying a proposal that would bar President Trump from taking any military intervention without their authorization.",
    "text": "WASHINGTON \u2013 Looting is rampant. Clean water is running low. Mass blackouts continue. And the potential for political violence is ever present.\n\nThat is the quickly deteriorating situation in Venezuela \u2013 where Nicolas Maduro clings to his presidency despite massive American and international pressure for his ouster.\n\nIn Washington, top Trump administration officials sharpened their rhetoric and hinted at a more aggressive posture. Democratic lawmakers prepared a proposal that would bar President Donald Trump from any military intervention without congressional authorization \u2013 fearing that such a step is in the works and that it would be disastrous.\n\nPeople collect water falling from a leaking pipeline along the banks of the Guaire River during rolling blackouts, which affects access to running water in people's homes, offices and stores, in Caracas, Venezuela, March 11, 2019. The blackout has intensified the toxic political climate, with opposition leader Juan Guaido blaming alleged government corruption and mismanagement and President Nicolas Maduro accusing his U.S.-backed adversary of sabotaging the national grid. More\n\n\u201cThe situation in Venezuela has gotten considerably worse in the last week,\u201d said Brett Bruen, a former foreign service officer stationed in Venezuela and a global engagement adviser in the Obama administration. \u201cIt\u2019s gone from alarming to catastrophic, so that requires a reassessment of what our policy is.\u201d\n\nThursday marked the seventh day of Venezuela\u2019s mass power outage \u2013 which has exacerbated the crisis for Venezuelans coping with food and medicine shortages. Without power, hospitals have been unable to help the sick and dying, water pumps have stopped working, and vandals have ransacked stores and other businesses, according to media reports.\n\nChina offered to come to the rescue of Maduro's socialist government, which has been unable to fix the power grid and is increasingly isolated internationally.\n\n\u201cChina is deeply concerned about this,\u201d Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said in Beijing on Wednesday. \u201cChina is willing to provide help and technical support to restore Venezuela\u2019s power grid.\u201d\n\nCiting the dire conditions, the State Department withdrew all its American Embassy staff from Venezuela this week. American officials expressed alarm at Maduro\u2019s call Monday for armed gangs, known as \u201ccolectivos,\u201d to rise up and fight the political opposition. The Trump administration has recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as the legitimate president of Venezuela and labeled Maduro a corrupt usurper.\n\n\u201cI call on the colectivos,\u201d Maduro declared, according to The Washington Post. \u201cThe hour of resistance has arrived.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s calling for armed gangs to take over the streets, and it is obviously going to be a great worry to Venezuelans,\u201d Elliott Abrams, the Trump administration\u2019s special envoy for Venezuela, said during a State Department briefing Tuesday. \u201cPerhaps it is a sign of Maduro\u2019s lack of confidence in his own security forces. But it is by definition a breakdown of law and order.\u201d\n\nAbrams and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo suggested this week that the Trump administration was preparing to increase pressure on Maduro. In his announcement that all American diplomats would leave Venezuela, Pompeo said their presence on the ground was a \u201cconstraint on U.S. policy.\u201d The secretary of state did not elaborate, but the remark fueled speculation of military intervention.\n\nAbrams said the administration would impose \u201csignificant\u201d new sanctions on Venezuela in the coming days. He declined to say whether the Trump administration asked the Pentagon to draft military options.\n\nMichael Dobson, a former senior sanctions policy adviser at the U.S. Treasury Department, said the United States is running out of economic tools to squeeze Maduro. The administration has slapped sanctions on the country\u2019s oil sector, which is by far its largest source of revenue. Dobson said the Treasury Department could look at restrictions on Venezuela\u2019s gold industry and some other minerals.\n\n\u201cBut beyond that, there isn\u2019t much left,\u201d said Dobson, an attorney in Washington. \u201cSo it\u2019s largely a waiting game to see, will the military recalculate and see that it\u2019s no longer worth having Maduro in the chair?\u201d",

Most of the time, such a description would be fit by large-scale disasters like wars, epidemics, and famine. Sometimes, however, portents of doom might barely seem newsworthy.\n\nSeemingly innocuous things like a low birth rate, a shortage of vultures, or just having too many cattle around are, for some countries, more dire than they appear. While the following situations seem unspectacular, they could lead to worse disasters.\n\n\n\n\n\n10 South Korea\u2019s Birth Crisis\n\n\n\nSouth Korea\u2019s birth crisis is so bad that the government is paying couples to have children. The nation\u2019s fertility rate hit a record low in 2018. At the current rate, the population is expected to grow in the negative in just ten years. This means there will be more deaths than births. If the trend is allowed to continue, it is estimated that there will be nobody left in the country by 2750.\n\nIn just 13 years, the South Korean government has spent over $121 billion to encourage parents to have more children. These days, most parents are eligible to receive up to $270 a month from the government.\n\nStarting in late 2019, parents with children below the age of eight will be allowed to work one hour less per day. The government is also building more kindergartens and day cares. Fathers will also given be a paid paternity leave of ten days\u2014seven days more than the currently approved three days.[1]\n\n\n\n9 India\u2019s Stray Cow Crisis\n\n\n\nThe Indian state of Uttar Pradesh is currently experiencing a severe stray cow crisis. Cows are not eaten in India because they are considered sacred creatures. Some people do eat cows, but the state government and cow protection groups have been clamping down on them.\n\nThis has left farmers with fewer incentives to keep male calves and cows that no longer produce milk. Most farmers abandon these unproductive cattle on the streets because having them around costs money. In 2012, there were 1,009,436 stray cattle in the state of Uttar Pradesh. This year\u2019s Live Stock Census is expected to show a much higher number.\n\nThe stray cattle have become a nuisance because they raid farmlands and eat crops. Some cows end up in cow shelters, which have quickly become overcrowded and underfunded. These days, farmers and community members lock the stray cattle in government buildings like schools and hospitals.[2]\n\n\n\n\n\n8 Venezuela\u2019s Passport Crisis\n\n\n\nVenezuela has been in the news for all the wrong reasons over the past few years. The oil-rich Latin American nation has suffered serious hyperinflation that has almost brought its economy to a standstill. And with two people claiming to be president, its many problems won\u2019t be ending anytime soon.\n\nOver 2.3 million people have fled Venezuela for neighboring Latin American nations since 2014. However, many more are still stuck because they do not have passports. The passport crisis is so bad that fellow Latin American nations are allowing Venezuelans in with expired passports. But Venezuelans without passports remain stuck in the nation.\n\nGetting a passport or any government-issued document was an uphill task before the crisis. Now it\u2019s worse. Workers at the passport office are known to deliberately delay passports unless passport-seekers pay bribes of $1,000 to $5,000. Today\u2019s passport-seekers don\u2019t have that kind of money. And the government itself isn\u2019t too keen on allowing its citizens to leave.[3]\n\n7 Venezuela\u2019s Health Care Crisis\n\nVenezuela is also experiencing a severe health care crisis. At least 22,000 doctors have fled the country since the crisis began, causing a nationwide shortage of doctors. Several hospitals have either closed or operate irregularly. Those that remain open do not have enough supplies.\n\nThese days, patients are required to bring their own drugs, syringes, gloves, and even soap. This has seen Venezuelan hospitals go from places where people are cured to places where they get killed. It is normal for patients to contract deadly diseases while admitted for other ailments.\n\nThis is worsened by a shortage of drugs, which, coupled with severely malnourished patients, is the perfect recipe for disaster. Hospitals have also seen an increase in burn victims. Most are toddlers who got burned when they strayed into wood fires and kerosene lamps that have taken the place of heaters and light bulbs.[4]\n\n6 China\u2019s Food Crisis\n\n\n\nChina has been experiencing a food crisis for a few years now, and the trade war with the US made it worse. Last year, the Chinese government introduced several tariffs to much-needed food imports like soybeans, sorghum, and corn in response to Trump\u2019s tariffs on Chinese goods.\n\nInterestingly, the Chinese government-owned Sinograin, which keeps a stockpile of grain for the government, had to pay the tariffs. President Xi Jinping later toured areas of Northeast China, where most of China\u2019s farms are based, and said that China should become more self-sufficient in food production.\n\nFood production has always been a problem for China. China\u2019s arable farmland amounts to less than a tenth of the world\u2019s farmland, even though it has one fifth of the world\u2019s population. On top of that, lots of its farmland is either occupied by industries or contaminated with heavy metals released by those industries.[5]\n\nThe food crisis began decades ago, when an improved standard of living caused Chinese citizens to shift from carbohydrate- to protein-rich diets, and there isn\u2019t enough farmland to grow vegetables and rear livestock. For now, China has been able to manage by importing food and leasing or buying farmland in Africa, Australia, and the Americas.\n\nHowever, the trade war with the US has shown that importation could be unreliable. Besides, most countries harboring Chinese farms are expecting a population boom in a few decades and will be needing the farmland to feed their own citizens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5 The US Recyclable Plastic Crisis\n\n\n\nBad news for environmental activists: the US government cannot recycle most of its recyclable plastics. A few years ago, a huge chunk of recyclable items used in the US ended up in China. This changed in January 2018, when China banned recyclable plastics from the US.\n\nThe US turned to Canada, Turkey, Malaysia, and Thailand to recycle its plastics. In the first half of 2017, the US exported 4,000 tons of recyclable plastics to Thailand. Within six months of China\u2019s ban, the US had exported 91,505 tons of plastic to Thailand. That\u2019s a 1,985-percent increase.\n\nBut these countries do not want US plastics. Malaysia introduced a tax and limited the types of plastics that are acceptable. Thailand has promised to ban US plastics within two years. In response, several US states have either abandoned recycling some types of plastics or dumped recycling altogether.[6]\n\n4 China\u2019s Birth Crisis\n\n\n\nA few decades ago, China introduced a one-child policy to control its booming population. The policy was strictly enforced, with the government even conducting forced abortions and sterilization on people who flouted the policy.\n\nIn 2015, the government replaced the one-child policy with the two-child policy when it realized that the nation was experiencing a decline in population growth, just like South Korea. But it seems like most Chinese couples prefer having just one child or none at all.\n\nThe Chinese government wants parents to have more than one kid so badly that it is encouraging couples to have more children \u201cfor the country.\u201d A government-run newspaper also informed couples that, \u201cHaving children is a family matter but also a national matter.\u201d\n\nThe government is considering paying couples to have a second child. It is also considering tax breaks or even dumping its two-child policy to allow couples have as many children as they want.[7]\n\n3 India\u2019s Vulture Crisis\n\n\n\nIndia had lots of vultures in the past. Its vulture population was so high that nobody bothered to count, though an estimate put it at 40 million in the early 1990s. This changed between 1992 and 2007, during which the vulture population fell by 97 to 99.9 percent. India has only around 20,000 vultures today.\n\nInterestingly, nobody noticed the decline in vulture population until researchers and villagers suddenly noticed that they were not seeing enough vultures. Some villagers even thought the US had stolen their vultures.\n\nRemember we mentioned that Indians generally don\u2019t eat cattle? This is where the vultures come in. Indian farmers fed their dead cattle to vultures. Unfortunately, diclofenac, a popular painkiller used for cattle, is lethal to vultures. It causes renal failure and death in vultures that eat the carcasses of dead cattle.\n\nNow, there aren\u2019t enough vultures to eat the carcasses, leaving lots of dead and decomposing cattle scattered across India. This has left the country on the brink of a disease epidemic. Rats and dogs have replaced the vultures, but they are not as effective. Besides, dogs could pass bacteria in the carcasses to humans.\n\nIndia has banned diclofenac and introduced breeding programs to repopulate the wild with vultures. However, it will take time before it gets the intended results. The government could also suffer a setback because some cattle owners still use diclofenac illegally.[8]\n\n2 South Korea\u2019s Suicide Crisis\n\n\n\nSouth Korea has one of the highest suicide rates in the world. 13,500 South Koreans committed suicide in 2015. That\u2019s an average of 37 in a day. Most who choose to end their own lives are senior citizens, who often live in poverty and do not want to become a burden to their living relatives. Many aged South Koreans are so poor that they depend on free meals to survive.\n\nIn response to high suicide rates, the government has criminalized suicide pacts\u2014agreements between two or more people who promise to engage in joint suicide.[9] In 2011, the government also reduced suicide rates by 15 percent when it banned paraquat, a pesticide often used to commit suicide.\n\n1 Germany\u2019s Renewable Energy Crisis\n\n\n\nGermany is the model nation for renewable energy. On one Sunday in 2017, it generated so much power from its renewable sources that the government paid users to use the excess power. This is referred to as \u201cnegative prices\u201d and has also happened in Belgium, Britain, France, Switzerland, and the Netherlands.\n\nIn such instances, the government pays citizens and factories to switch on equipment and machines they are not using. Imagine the US government paying you to switch on your washing machine for no reason. To be clear, the government does not give consumers money. Rather, the energy companies subtract it from their electricity bills.\n\nNegative prices happen because green energy is unpredictable and uncontrollable. Coal and nuclear plant output can be increased or decreased to meet demands. Solar panels and wind turbines cannot. They generate electricity depending on the weather conditions.\n\nGreen energy companies keep themselves abreast of the weather with forecasts. But for anybody who has ended up in the rain when the weatherman said it would be sunny, we know weather forecasts are not always reliable.\n\nThe attempt to shift to green energy has created a crisis Germans call \u201cenergy poverty.\u201d Energy poverty happens when people find it difficult to pay for electricity, or they spend so much on electricity that they do not have enough money to survive. This happens because Germans pay an average annual tax of $171 and high electricity prices to keep the green energy companies in business.\n\nBesides plunging many into energy poverty, the unreliable green energy is counterproductive for Germany. While the government pays citizens to waste excess electricity, it always leaves it coal and nuclear plants working in case the green sources do not produce enough electricity. This has increased Germany\u2019s carbon emissions and even caused the government to build more coal plants.[10]\n\nPin 1 Email 40 Shares\n\nPin 1 Email 40 Shares",

    "description": "How Russia sank billions of dollars into Venezuelan quicksand Reuters Russian oil company Rosneft spent a fortune on joint ventures in Venezuela even though it suspected it was losing out on millions of dollars, documents show.",
    "text": "Missing parts and missed deadlines\n\nIn September 2012, at a drilling site in the Orinoco basin, Rosneft\u2019s Sechin filled a jar with crude oil and lifted it into the air to mark the moment his firm joined the ranks of global oil majors. Rosneft was part of a Russian consortium that had acquired a 40 percent share in Venezuela\u2019s Junin-6 oilfield. PDVSA held the other 60 percent.\n\nRosneft already pumped oil from its home fields in Siberia; now it had an overseas presence too, tapping into some of the world's biggest crude oil reserves on the banks of the Orinoco River. \u201cToday is indeed an historic day,\u201d Sechin told Russian state television at the ceremony to mark the start of production. \u201cRussian companies have now proved their right to be among the leaders of the global oil sector.\u201d\n\nYet soon after Sechin spoke, Rosneft's foray into the Orinoco basin was running into problems, the documents reviewed by Reuters show.\n\nIn November 2012, without asking its Russian partners, PDVSA shut down one of the four drilling rigs at Junin-6 and removed it, a report by the Russian consortium found that year. Local people staged protests that further blocked work. By the end of 2012, just six wells had been drilled, far short of the project\u2019s target of 47.\n\n\u201cAs of 15.08.2015, PDVSA is in technical default.\u201d\n\nSpare parts for drilling at Junin-6 were procured from a PDVSA unit called Bariven; but getting equipment from Bariven took 10 to 18 months, according to the documents. Drilling rigs were not operating 37 percent of the time. It took on average 49 days to drill a single well, instead of the anticipated 22 days. PDVSA did not respond to questions about the delays.\n\nJunin-6 production forecasts were cut. Rosneft had said in September 2012 that the field would deliver 20,000 barrels per day by the end of the year. In fact, over the whole of 2012 it yielded only 21,400 barrels.\n\nThree years on, there was little sign of improvement. A Rosneft report covering the first three quarters of 2015 cited well construction \u201cof an unsatisfactory quality\u201d and \u201cnon-optimal trajectories\u201d of wells.\n\nBy the end of 2015, the forecast for peak oil output from Junin-6 had been slashed from 450,000 barrels per day to 250,000 barrels per day. Rosneft\u2019s flagship project had lost its lustre.\n\nProblems remain across the Orinoco Basin, according to union leaders who spoke to Reuters. They said that in fields east of Junin, only a handful of the dozens of drilling rigs are working at any one time. Workers complain they don\u2019t have basic equipment such as boots, gloves and helmets. The situation in PDVSA offices is no better. Paper is in short supply. In a vain effort to stem a worker exodus, some HR departments display \u201cNo resignation\u201d signs.\n\nNor is life in Venezuela easy for Rosneft staff. There is often no mains water in the high-end Caracas district where they live, said a Russian who knows families there. A couple of times a week, a water tanker arrives and fills up containers in each apartment.\n\nTwo of Rosneft's Russian partners in Junin-6 dropped out. The smaller Surgutneftegaz decided to quit the project in November 2012. In December 2014, Russia\u2019s second biggest oil firm, Lukoil, announced it too was dropping out. \u201cLooking back, a lot of people at Lukoil breathed a sigh of relief that they didn't have to pile billions into Venezuela,\u201d said an executive in the Junin-6 consortium.\n\nSurgutneftegaz did not respond to a request for comment. Lukoil declined to comment.\n\nRosneft bought out the Surgutneftegaz and Lukoil stakes for upward of $300 million, analysts estimated, deepening its exposure to Venezuela. It also acquired a stake belonging to TNK-BP when it purchased the Russian-British firm in a $55 billion deal in 2013. That left Gazpromneft, the oil unit of state-owned gas firm Gazprom, as Rosneft\u2019s sole remaining Russian partner in Junin-6. Gazpromneft did not reply to Reuters\u2019 questions.\n\nRosneft also had four smaller oil projects with PDVSA at that time. All were experiencing problems during this period, the Rosneft internal reports show. Two of the projects, Carabobo and Petromonagas, are in the Orinoco basin; Boqueron is in the east near the Atlantic coast; Petroperija is on the Caribbean coast.\n\nRosneft internal reports from 2015 concluded that crude flow rates envisaged in the contract for the Carabobo fields were \u201cnot achievable.\u201d At Petromonagas, poor quality work caused drilling delays. At Petroperija, production was falling and the joint venture did not have the cash to buy essential pumping equipment. At the Boqueron field, a broken compressor, a device to raise gas pressure, could not be fixed because the joint venture\u2019s bank account was empty.\n\nMoney troubles\n\nIf getting oil out of its projects was a struggle for Rosneft, so was extracting revenue, the documents show.\n\nThe Russian consortium\u2019s report into operations at Junin-6 in 2012 found that PDVSA had taken $12 million from the Junin-6 budget, without Rosneft\u2019s agreement, for social spending on local people. Only 350 people lived in the area covered by the concession - some 447 square kilometers of hilly scrubland on the northern bank of the Orinoco River.\n\nIn the second half of 2014, Rosneft ordered an audit of the Junin-6 project to check for \u201cdistortion of financial accounting\u201d and \u201cunjustified expenditures.\u201d Reuters couldn\u2019t determine that audit\u2019s conclusions.\n\nRosneft managers ordered the company\u2019s own auditors to investigate money flows between PDVSA and the Petromonagas, Petroperija and Boqueron joint ventures, internal documents relating to the audit show. The audit concluded that PDVSA had understated earnings from Petromonagas oil sales by some $700 million. PDVSA challenged this figure, another document shows, and it was revised to $500 million.\n\nIn a document dated April 30, 2015, Sechin, Rosneft\u2019s chief executive, approved the findings of the audit, and a plan to protect Rosneft\u2019s investments with a series of measures to be implemented by the end of May that year.\n\nThe measures included installing metering stations to monitor how much oil was being pumped to customers, and therefore how much money the ventures should be earning. Rosneft wanted an independent assessor to track how the joint ventures spent money. And it wanted PDVSA to stop hiring its own subsidiaries without signing a contract. Reuters couldn\u2019t determine whether the measures were put into action.\n\nA few months later, in October 2015, Rosneft First Vice President Eric Liron reported to Sechin that there was still disagreement with PDVSA on settling accounts with the joint ventures. Liron wrote in a memo to Sechin: \u201cAs of 15.08.2015, PDVSA is in technical default.\u201d\n\nMonths of efforts to get the money \u2013 in which Rosneft\u2019s Venezuela office and senior executives at headquarters engaged in negotiations with PDVSA officials \u2013 went nowhere. The Rosneft internal auditor stated in the November 2015 email to his colleague that the problem was \u201cunresolved because of the poor financial health of our partner\u201d - a reference to PDVSA.\n\nDiscussing a proposal to push the internal deadline for fixing the problem to a later date, the auditor asked sardonically what would be the point. \u201cWill it (PDVSA) return to health by then, or will it die and the question will no longer be relevant?\u201d he wrote in the same email.\n\nThe auditor left Rosneft in 2016, according to his LinkedIn profile. He did not respond to a message seeking comment.\n\nRosneft was supposed to receive its share of the revenue from oil sales in the form of dividends. As of the fourth quarter of 2015, Rosneft internal presentations showed that the company was owed dividends from three of its joint ventures. The total shortfall was $337 million. The presentations listed among the strategic aims of each of the three projects: \u201cReceiving unpaid dividends\u201d from PDVSA.\n\nSince the period covered by the documents, Rosneft has acted to take greater control of its investments, for example by bringing in its own contractors. Rosneft says PDVSA has paid off much of its debt. In a financial report released on Feb. 5, 2019, Rosneft said the loans it extended to PDVSA, which had totalled about $6.5 billion, were now down to $2.3 billion.\n\nBut serious challenges remain.\n\nRosneft\u2019s own reports and assessments by energy analysts show the company\u2019s projects in Venezuela are today still producing less oil than originally anticipated, with development plans either shelved or behind schedule.\n\nRosneft\u2019s flagship joint venture in Venezuela, the Junin-6 field, is still stuck in the exploration and test production phase, Rosneft wrote in its 2017 annual report. An executive at Russian partner Gazpromneft went further, saying the project is now \u201ccommercially pointless.\u201d The executive did not elaborate. Rosneft did not reply to Reuters questions about the commercial viability of the project.\n\nAdditional reporting by Oksana Kobzeva, Anton Zverev, Olesya Astakhova, Katya Golubkova, Olga Yagova, Gabrielle Tetrault-Farber, Vladimir Soldatkin, Alexander Ershov, Gleb Gorodyankin, Tatiana Ustinova and Margarita Popova in Moscow; Dmitry Zhdannikov in London; Marianna Parraga in Mexico City; Brian Ellsworth, Vivian Sequera, Alexandra Ulmer and Luc Cohen in Caracas.\n\nBillions spent, little to show Reuters estimates that after sinking more than $9 billion into Venezuela in loans, acquisitions and project spending since 2010, Rosneft, which is majority owned by the Russian state, has yet to show a profit. At the end of 2018, Rosneft had spent approximately $1.5 billion more in Venezuela than it had earned in the form of oil allocated to it as dividends, according to Reuters\u2019 calculations. This figure is reached by calculating the value of oil Rosneft received from its joint venture projects and subtracting from that outstanding loans Rosneft issued to PDVSA, official payments Rosneft made to Venezuela for access to oil fields, Rosneft capital expenditure on the ventures, and the cost of extracting Rosneft\u2019s share of the oil. The cost figures are based on a benchmark for operational expenditure in Venezuela of $15 per barrel. Rosneft did not respond to a request for comment. The Reuters estimate of Rosneft\u2019s financial shortfall in Venezuela could be conservative because it does not take into account tax Rosneft had to pay in Venezuela. This tax rate is not publicly disclosed, but Caracas normally takes at least 50 percent of the value of each barrel of oil. The estimate also does not include instances where PDVSA, according to documents reviewed by Reuters, failed to give Rosneft the share of oil production at joint projects that the Russian company believed it was due. Nor does it include cases where Rosneft had to sink extra capital expenditure into fields and plug unexpected holes in the joint ventures\u2019 balance sheets. In April last year, energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said its forecast for peak production at the Junin-6 field was now 120,000 barrels per day - half as much as Rosneft\u2019s internal documents forecast back in 2015, and just over a quarter of the 450,000 barrels initially predicted. The Boqueron field and Petroperija joint ventures were loss-making, Rosneft said in its financial report for 2018. At the Patao, Mejillones and Rio Caribe offshore gas prospects, which Venezuela signed over to Rosneft in 2017, there was no development plan or infrastructure plan in place, Wood Mackenzie said last year. The Petromonagas project \u2013 where Rosneft had planned to increase output - has also been falling short of hopes, internal PDVSA documents show. As of last July, it was pumping less oil per day than it had in 2015.\n\nOrinoco swamp By Christian Lowe and Rinat Sagdiev Photo editing: Simon Newman Design: Catherine Tai Edited by Janet McBride, Mike Collett-White and Richard Woods",

Marco Rubio (R-FL) and White House National Security adviser John Bolton that the Venezuelan military were responsible for deliberately burning the aid convoys. Both Bolton and Rubio are currently leading U.S. efforts to isolate the Maduro regime, with the Treasury Department imposing a range of sanctions on senior regime officials as well as the country\u2019s vital oil industry.\n\nIt is not the first time that Omar has weighed in on the crisis. Earlier this year, she falsely accused the Trump administration of trying to install a \u201cfar-right\u201d leader in replace of Maduro, after the U.S. joined dozens of Western democracies in recognizing opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 (whose Popular Party is actually affiliated with the Socialist International) as the country\u2019s legitimate president.\n\n\u201cA US-backed coup in Venezuela is not a solution to the dire issues they face,\u201d she wrote in January. \u201cTrump\u2019s efforts to install a far-right opposition will only incite violence and further destabilize the region. We must support Mexico, Uruguay & the Vatican\u2019s efforts to facilitate a peaceful dialogue.\u201d\n\nA US backed coup in Venezuela is not a solution to the dire issues they face.

    "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil prices edged higher on Tuesday, supported by signs of tightening global supply after a Saudi official said the kingdom plans to cut oil exports in April, while the U.S. government reduced its forecast for domestic crude output growth.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Drilling rigs are parked up in the Cromarty Firth near Invergordon, Scotland, Britain January 27, 2015. REUTERS/Russell Cheyne\n\nSaudi Arabia, seeking to drain a supply glut and support prices, plans to cut its crude oil exports next month to below 7 million barrels per day (bpd), while keeping its output well below 10 million bpd, a Saudi official said on Monday.\n\nBrent crude futures rose 9 cents, or 0.1 percent, to settle at $66.67 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 8 cents, or 0.1 percent, to settle at $56.87 a barrel.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, both benchmarks have risen around 25 percent.\n\nCrude has been supported since the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia, returned to supply cuts as of Jan. 1. The group, known as OPEC+, agreed to reduce supply by 1.2 million bpd for six months.\n\nSaudi Arabia has voluntarily cut its supply by more than the deal requires and in April will keep output \u201cwell below\u201d 10 million bpd, the Saudi official said - less than the 10.311 million bpd the kingdom had agreed to pump.\n\nOn Sunday, Saudi oil minister Khalid al-Falih said it would be too early to change OPEC+ output policy at the group\u2019s meeting in April.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates in February exceeded its OPEC target for oil output cuts, achieving 119 percent of its goal, the country\u2019s energy minister said on Tuesday at an energy conference.\n\nA host of involuntary supply curbs in OPEC members, caused by unrest in Libya and U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela, have also boosted prices.\n\nIn addition, Venezuela\u2019s state-run oil firm PDVSA has been unable to resume crude exports from its primary port since a power outage last week, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.\n\nIn the United States, domestic crude production is expected to grow more slowly than previously anticipated in 2019, averaging about 12.3 million bpd, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said.\n\n\u201cPart of the pushback against OPEC+ efforts has been this idea of unrelenting growth in U.S. oil production, primarily shale. The EIA report reined some of that in, and the report was supportive in that respect,\u201d said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC in New York.\n\nHowever, the EIA cut its 2019 world oil demand growth forecast by 40,000 bpd to 1.45 million bpd.\n\nU.S. crude inventories fell by 2.6 million barrels in the week to March 8 to 449 million, the American Petroleum Institute industry group said on Tuesday. Analysts had expected an increase of 2.7 million barrels.\n\nThe official U.S. government report on crude stockpiles will be released on Wednesday.",

A rally convened by the government was also sparsely attended.\n\n\u201cVenezuelans are being completely consumed by the search for the basics,\u201d said Domingo Alvarez, 70, a retired journalist who joined about two dozen neighbors clapping and chanting for Guaido on a main street in downtown Caracas. \u201cWe are forced to pay for the inaction and mistakes caused by this government. Sadly, protesting is now secondary.\u201d\n\nVenezuela has spent months gripped by political crisis: Guaido\u2019s attempt to topple President Nicolas Maduro, under whose regime the nation has fallen into ruin. When power went out on March 7, it choked off water service, stalled refineries and knocked the Caracas subway out of commission. The government has blamed a U.S.-sponsored cyber attack, but experts have said the real culprit is a lack of maintenance.\n\nIn Caracas, a metropolitan area of about 5.5. million, parts of the city saw power restored Tuesday, but in some cases swiftly blinked out again. Residents continued to hunt for potable water and food. Communications remained difficult with patchy mobile-phone service and internet.\n\nOn a bridge that overlooked a main avenue downtown, the government held a small rally attended by activists and militia members. Venezuelan folk music blared, drowning out the din of the small protests below, while red-shirted Maduro supporters sat watching state propaganda projected on a large screen.\n\nGuaido, recognized by more than 50 countries as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate head of state, drove around Caracas encouraging supporters to keep protesting in hopes of swaying the military to his side and occupying the presidential palace, Miraflores.\n\n\u201cNo doubt, tough days are ahead, but they will determine our freedom,\u201d Guaido said from a megaphone atop a car. \u201cAnd you will tell your children, grandchildren and friends that we freed Venezuela once and for all.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we have the armed forces fully aligned, we will go and take my office that is there in Miraflores very soon.\u201d\n\nTo contact the reporters on this story: Alex Vasquez in Caracas Office at avasquez45@bloomberg.net;Andrew Rosati in Caracas at arosati3@bloomberg.net\n\nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Stephen Merelman at smerelman@bloomberg.net, Robert Jameson\n\nFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com\n\n\u00a92019 Bloomberg L.P.",

But Maduro has clung to power thanks to the support of the powerful Venezuelan military.\n\nCover image: A view during a power cut in Caracas, Venezuela, on March 7, 2019.
