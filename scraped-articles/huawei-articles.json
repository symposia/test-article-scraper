    "text": "Huawei\u2019s already proven that a ban in the world\u2019s second largest smartphone market won\u2019t hamper its rapid success, but the company still won\u2019t go down in the States without a fight. Word is that the consumer electronics giant is planning to unveil a lawsuit against the U.S. government later this week.\n\nThat news comes via two anonymous sources reported in The New York Times this morning. The reported impending suit is pushback against longstanding bans in the States that have barred the company\u2019s equipment from infrastructural projects ahead of a nationwide push into 5G. It\u2019s also made the nation\u2019s carriers and retail stores wary of stocking Huawei products.\n\nThe suit is reportedly set to be filed in the Eastern District of Texas \u2014 the location of Huawei\u2019s U.S. headquarters, as well as a notorious haven for patent trolls.\n\nU.S. officials have long recommended against using Huawei devices over alleged ties to the Chinese government. On Friday, meanwhile, the Canadian DOJ allowed an extradition case against Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou to proceed after her arrest in Vancouver late last year. Those charges stem from allegations that the company circumvented sanctions on Iran.\n\nEarlier today it was announced that Meng was filing a civil suit in the country, alleging that authorities didn\u2019t advise her of her constitutional rights prior to questioning and detaining her.\n\nWe\u2019ve reached out to Huawei for comment on the suits.",

    "text": "OTTAWA (Reuters) - The lawyers for Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou are suing the Canadian government, its border agency and federal police, alleging their client was detained, searched and interrogated for three hours in violation of her constitutional rights.\n\nCanada arrested Meng in Vancouver on Dec. 1 at the request of the United States, which has brought sweeping charges against her and China\u2019s Huawei Technologies Co that portray the company as a threat to U.S. national security. Meng was charged with bank and wire fraud to violate American sanctions against Iran.\n\nIn a civil lawsuit filed in the British Columbia Supreme Court on Friday, Meng\u2019s lawyers said the manner in which officers obtained evidence and information from Meng constituted serious violations of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Meng is the daughter of Huawei\u2019s founder.\n\nIt added that Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) officers deliberately delayed the immediate execution of an arrest warrant and unlawfully subjected Meng to detention, search and interrogation to extract evidence from her before she was arrested.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police - Canada\u2019s federal police - only exercised its arrest warrant three hours after Meng\u2019s \u201cunlawful\u201d detention at the airport, the lawsuit added.\n\nThere was no immediate response from Canada\u2019s justice ministry or the RCMP. The CBSA said it did not comment on matters before the courts.\n\nMeng, who is out on bail, is due to appear in a Vancouver court at 10 a.m. PST (1800 GMT) on Wednesday, when a date will be set for her extradition hearing. The Canadian government approved her extradition proceedings on Friday.\n\nSlideshow (3 Images)\n\nChina, whose relations with Canada have deteriorated over the affair, denounced Canada\u2019s decision on Friday and repeated previous demands for Meng\u2019s release.\n\nThe lawsuit further alleged that Meng was directed to surrender all her electronic devices, computers and passwords and that CBSA officers then unlawfully opened and viewed the contents of the seized devices in violation of her right to privacy.\n\nCBSA officers also searched Meng\u2019s luggage in violation of the right to privacy, the lawsuit said. \u201cThe CBSA Officers knew or were recklessly indifferent to the fact that they had no authority to conduct such a search, which search was performed under the false pretense of a routine customs or immigration related examination,\u201d according to the lawsuit.",

    "text": "(Reuters) - The surprise arrest of Huawei\u2019s chief financial officer in December quickly turned the executive, Meng Wanzhou, into a central figure in a trade war between two economic superpowers.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A researcher works at a laboratory inside the headquarters of the Chinese telecommunications equipment and smartphone maker Huawei in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China March 6, 2019. REUTERS/Yuyang Wang\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump told Reuters he would consider intervening in her case - a potential action he alluded to again two weeks ago - if it would help close a trade deal with China.\n\nMeng\u2019s lawyer on Wednesday told a Canadian court that he has concerns the allegations against her have a political character, noting Trump\u2019s comments on the case.\n\nBut U.S. probes of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd for allegedly evading U.S. sanctions on Iran were not rooted in Trump\u2019s trade aspirations. Long before Trump initiated a bitter trade war with China, Huawei activities were under scrutiny by U.S. authorities, according to interviews with ten people familiar with the Huawei probes and documents related to the investigations seen by Reuters.\n\nThe U.S. focus on Huawei intensified after years of investigation into smaller Chinese rival ZTE Corp, and relied in part on information collected from devices of company employees traveling through airports.\n\nTwo of the sources said a critical point took place in August 2017, when deputy U.S. Attorney General Rod Rosenstein - best known for his oversight of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe of Russian interference in the U.S. election \u2013 handed a lead role to Brooklyn prosecutors to pursue possible bank fraud charges against Huawei.\n\nFifteen months later, that strategy would help land Meng in a Canadian jail.\n\nThe U.S. investigations of China\u2019s top telecom companies were spurred by reports by Reuters over six years ago, detailing possible Iran sanctions violations by both ZTE and Huawei, as well as close ties between Huawei and Skycom Tech Co Ltd - a suspected front company doing business in Iran.\n\nA spokesman for Huawei, the world\u2019s largest telecommunications equipment maker, has denied the charges in the sanctions case, and did not provide further comment to Reuters. Meng has said she is innocent of the charges. ZTE, which pleaded guilty in 2017 for illegally shipping U.S. goods to Iran, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nU.S. Justice Department spokeswoman Nicole Navas Oxman said the government pursues cases \u201cfree of any political interference and follows the evidence and rule of law in pursuing criminal charges.\u201d\n\nAIRPORT EVIDENCE GRAB\n\nOn December 1, 2018, Meng was stopped at Vancouver International Airport as she walked up the jetway after her flight, according to a lawsuit she filed on Friday accusing the Canadian government of violating her rights. Border officers examined her passport and escorted her to an area for secondary screenings.\n\nWhile there, she was instructed to surrender her two mobile phones, an iPad and a personal computer, along with their passwords, the suit alleges, and the officers viewed the devices\u2019 contents.\n\nReuters has not been able to determine what information was found on Meng\u2019s devices, but it is not the first time she and other Chinese telecom executives have turned over such property to border patrol agents.\n\nIn the years leading up to the Huawei indictment, U.S. officials had been capturing information that would influence the investigation when telecom executives passed through U.S. airports, according to a number of sources familiar with the Huawei and ZTE investigations and the Meng indictment.\n\nFor example, Meng arrived in the United States via John F. Kennedy International Airport in early 2014. The indictment says investigators found \u201csuggested talking points\u201d on one of her electronic devices, stating among other things that Huawei\u2019s relationship with Skycom was \u201cnormal business cooperation.\u201d\n\nMeng had been pulled into a secondary screening at the airport that time as well, and her electronic devices were taken, according to one person familiar with the stop. After a couple of hours, the devices were returned and she was freed to go, the person said.\n\nAnother border search, this time on September 12, 2014, of executives from rival ZTE also supported U.S. investigators long-held suspicions of how Huawei might have been doing illicit business in countries subject to U.S. sanctions, one of the sources told Reuters.\n\nZTE\u2019s CFO at the time was stopped at Boston\u2019s Logan Airport after flying in from London with an assistant, the person said.\n\nThe assistant was carrying a Lenovo laptop containing a confidential ZTE document, dated August 25, 2011 and signed by four top executives, about the need to establish front companies to supply U.S. procured items needed for projects in embargoed countries.\n\nThe airport stop provided key evidence against ZTE in its legal battle with the United States, according to U.S. officials. But it also identified a company as \u201cF7\u201d and how it used a front company to serve as its agent for contracts in sanctioned countries. F7 was Huawei, according to the individuals familiar with the ZTE and Huawei investigations.\n\nThe document was posted on the U.S. Commerce Department website in March 2016 when ZTE was placed on a list of companies that were restricted from buying parts and components from U.S. suppliers. Shortly after the public posting, the New York Times reported that the description of F7 offered by ZTE matched Huawei.\n\nA month later, the Commerce Department sent a subpoena to Huawei in the United States demanding information on the company\u2019s exporting American technology to Iran, according to a court document and one of the people familiar with the Huawei probe.\n\nFROM ZTE TO HUAWEI\n\nWith the case against ZTE wrapping up, more than a dozen people from Departments of Treasury, Commerce, Homeland Security and Justice, gathered in Washington on February 14, 2017 and talked about how they were moving forward against Huawei, according to a person familiar with matter.\n\nBrooklyn prosecutors discussed the relationship between Huawei and HSBC, a bank that was required to cooperate with U.S. prosecutors in any investigation until the end of 2017 for violating U.S. anti-money laundering and sanctions laws, the person added.\n\nIn late 2016, HSBC began to conduct an internal bank probe of Huawei. In the weeks and months following the meeting, HSBC helped authorities obtain evidence of links between Skycom and Huawei, documents reviewed by Reuters show. The probe found Meng met in 2013 with a HSBC banker. She later gave him a copy of the PowerPoint presentation, which the U.S. indictment says misrepresented Huawei\u2019s control of Skycom.\n\nHSBC told Reuters that it provided information in response to demands from the Justice Department.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in Washington, D.C., meanwhile, pursued a more traditional export control investigation against Huawei, which included the accusations of attempted illegal shipments of computers to Iran disclosed in the Reuters 2012 story.\n\nA grand jury subpoena was issued to the U.S subsidiary of the company in April 2017, the first clear sign to Huawei that the probe had turned criminal.\n\nArmed with that knowledge, the company moved U.S.-based Chinese employees who knew about its Iranian dealings out of the country and otherwise concealed and destroyed evidence, the prosecutors allege. Meng and other Huawei executives also began to avoid travel to the United States, prosecutors say.\n\nIn the late summer of 2017, according to two of the sources close to the Huawei investigation, Rosenstein chose Brooklyn as the venue to file charges and the Washington U.S. Attorney\u2019s office dropped out of the case. Brooklyn was already working with a money laundering unit at the Justice Department. The national security division also merged with the Brooklyn prosecution team.\n\nLegal experts said since most evidence of any illegal U.S. goods in Iran presumably existed outside the jurisdiction of U.S. authorities, the bank fraud route presented a potentially quicker path to indictment. They added that bank fraud charges are more likely to lead to arrest by other countries for extradition to the United States than export controls or sanctions violations, and have a longer statute of limitations.\n\nMeng and the company were charged with bank and wire fraud. The PowerPoint presentation\u2019s \u201cnumerous misrepresentations\u201d were central to the charges brought against Meng herself, the indictment shows.\n\nTwelve months after Brooklyn got the case, prosecutors secretly obtained a warrant for Meng\u2019s arrest.\n\nLess than four months later they learned she was stopping in Vancouver en route to Mexico on December 1, and asked the Canadians to detain her at the airport.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Huawei partner offered embargoed HP gear to Iran - reut.rs/2sRL7Ve\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Huawei CFO linked to firm that offered HP gear to Iran - reut.rs/2sUq8RT\n\nEXCLUSIVE: China's ZTE planned U.S. computer sale to Iran - reut.rs/2T17JlN\n\nChinese firm (ZTE) helps Iran spy on citizens - reut.rs/2TlJJJq",

    "text": "Photo: AP\n\nChinese telecom firm Huawei has recently come under intense pressure in the U.S. to prove that the company isn\u2019t spying for the Chinese government. But if a new report is accurate, Huawei is ready to push back. Hard.\n\n\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Huawei is preparing a lawsuit against the U.S. government that could be formally announced by the end of this week. The details of Huawei\u2019s lawsuit are still unclear, but the Times claims that it will be an effort to force the U.S. \u201cto more publicly make its case\u201d that Huawei\u2019s technology is somehow a threat to the privacy and security of Americans. Gizmodo has reached out to Huawei for comment on the potential lawsuit but did not immediately hear back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe U.S. and other Five Eyes nations have alleged since at least 2012 that Huawei poses a national security threat to the west, especially if it\u2019s allowed to build critical 5G infrastructure around the world. But the national security concerns that have been so far leveled by American intelligence agencies have largely been hypothetical. Any potential specifics on how the Chinese government would use Huawei to make Americans less safe have only been uttered behind closed doors.\n\nFrom the New York Times:\n\nThe lawsuit that Huawei is preparing to file in the United States is expected to challenge a section of a defense spending authorization law that was approved last year. The provision blocks executive agencies from using telecom equipment made by Huawei and another Chinese company, ZTE. According to one of the people familiar with the matter, Huawei\u2019s lawsuit is likely to argue that the provision is a \u201cbill of attainder,\u201d or a legislative act that singles out a person or group for punishment without trial. The Constitution forbids Congress from passing such bills.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTop officials from the Five Eyes countries of the U.S., UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand reportedly met in July of 2018 to discuss the alleged threat from Huawei\u2019s technologies. But, again, the charge that Huawei poses a national security threat is so far pretty vague. A lawsuit brought by Huawei would theoretically force the U.S. government to state its case publicly, and Huawei would essentially be calling the U.S. government\u2019s bluff if U.S. officials couldn\u2019t point to specifics.\n\nBut one can easily imagine a situation where the U.S. government would be hesitant to lay out specific charges against Huawei by citing national security concerns\u2014a kind of Kafkaesque nightmare all around.\n\n\n\nIn January, the U.S. Justice Department announced charges against Huawei that include fraud, obstruction of justice, and the theft of trade secrets. And Huawei\u2019s CFO, Meng Wanzhou, was arrested in Vancouver this past December at the request of the U.S. government for allegedly violating sanctions against Iran. Meng, who is notably the daughter of Huawei\u2019s founder, faces extradition to the U.S. in the very near future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Friday, Meng filed her own civil lawsuit against the Canadian government, claiming multiple violations of her rights under Canada\u2019s Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Chinese government has accused both Canada and the U.S. of staging Meng\u2019s arrest as a purely political stunt and have demanded her immediate release.\n\nHuawei has been on a charm offensive over the past couple of months, with Huawei\u2019s CEO even giving rare interviews to U.S. media. Ren Zhengfei, the billionaire founder and CEO of Huawei, even went so far as to call President Donald Trump a \u201cgreat president.\u201d Trump, who is arguably the dumbest person to ever hold elected office in America, has responded favorably to that kind of flattery in the past.\n\n\u201cNo law requires any company in China to install mandatory back doors,\u201d Ren said on January 15, according to the Wall Street Journal. \u201cI personally would never harm the interest of my customers and me and my company would not answer to such requests.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI love my country, I support the Communist Party. But I will not do anything to harm the world,\u201d Ren said, according to a report in Bloomberg News.\n\nBut Huawei\u2019s public stance has become more adversarial over the past couple of weeks. For example, last week, Huawei\u2019s rotating chairman didn\u2019t pull his punches at the Mobile World Congress 2019 in Barcelona.\n\nDuring his keynote speech, Guo Ping said, \u201cPrism, prism on the wall, who\u2019s the most trustworthy of them all?\u201d a reference to the NSA\u2019s Prism spying program, which became public knowledge in 2013 after whistleblower Edward Snowden exposed details of the effort.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an important question. And if you don\u2019t understand that, you can go ask Edward Snowden,\u201d Guo continued.\n\nHuawei reportedly plans to sue in the Eastern District of Texas, which covers the location of Huawei\u2019s U.S. headquarters in Plano, Texas. Gizmodo will update this post if we hear back from Huawei.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[New York Times]",

    "description": "Chinese telecoms equipment maker Huawei Technologies sued the U.S. government on Thursday saying a law limiting its U.S. business was unconstitutional, ratcheting up its fight back against a government bent on closing it out of global markets.",
    "text": "HONG KONG/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Chinese telecoms equipment maker Huawei Technologies sued the U.S. government on Thursday, saying a law limiting its American business was unconstitutional, ratcheting up its fight back against a government bent on closing it out of global markets.\n\nHuawei said it had filed a complaint in a federal court in Texas challenging Section 889 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), signed into law by U.S. President Donald Trump in August, which bars federal agencies and their contractors from procuring its equipment and services.\n\nThe lawsuit marks the latest confrontation between China and the United States, which spent most of 2018 slapping import tariffs on billions of dollars worth of each other\u2019s goods. The year ended with the arrest of Huawei\u2019s chief financial officer in Canada at U.S. request, to the consternation of China.\n\nLong before Trump initiated the trade war, Huawei\u2019s activities were under scrutiny by U.S. authorities, according to interviews with 10 people familiar with the Huawei probes and documents related to the investigations seen by Reuters.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Congress has repeatedly failed to produce any evidence to support its restrictions on Huawei products. We are compelled to take this legal action as a proper and last resort,\u201d Huawei Rotating Chairman Guo Ping said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThis ban not only is unlawful, but also restricts Huawei from engaging in fair competition, ultimately harming U.S. consumers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe look forward to the court\u2019s verdict.\u201d\n\nWhile Huawei had very little share of the U.S. market before the bill, it is the world\u2019s biggest telecoms gear maker and is seeking to be at the forefront of a global rollout of fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks and services.\n\nIn its lawsuit, Huawei said its \u201cequipment and services are subject to advanced security procedures, and no backdoors, implants, or other intentional security vulnerabilities have been documented in any of the more than 170 countries in the world where Huawei equipment and services are used.\u201d\n\nThe privately owned firm has embarked on a public relations and legal offensive as Washington lobbies allies to abandon Huawei when building 5G networks, focusing on a 2017 Chinese law requiring companies to cooperate with national intelligence work.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Government is sparing no effort to smear the company and mislead the public,\u201d Guo said in a news briefing at Huawei\u2019s headquarters in southern China.\n\nThe U.S. State Department declined comment on the lawsuit on Thursday.\n\n\u201cMore generally,\u201d State Department spokesman Robert Palladino told reporters, \u201cthe United States advocates for secure telecom networks and supply chains that are free from suppliers subject to foreign government control or undue influence which would pose risks of unauthorized access and malicious cyber activity.\u201d\n\nU.S. Representative Mike Conaway, a Texas Republican who has sponsored anti-Huawei legislation, called the Huawei lawsuit \u201cbogus.\u201d\n\n\u201cNO PROOF\u201d\n\nThe NDAA bans the U.S. government from doing business with Huawei or compatriot peer ZTE Corp or from doing business with any company that has equipment from the two companies as a \u201csubstantial or essential component\u201d of their system.\n\nIn its lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Texas, Huawei argues that the section in question is illegal because it could sharply limit the company\u2019s ability to do business in the United States despite no proof of wrongdoing.\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges that Huawei has been denied due process and that Congress, by stripping Huawei of commercial opportunities, has violated the \u201cseparation of powers\u201d portion of the U.S. Constitution by doing the work of the courts.\n\nChinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said he had no information on whether China\u2019s government may also seek legal action against the U.S. law, but added Huawei\u2019s move is \u201ctotally reasonable and totally understandable.\u201d\n\nThe Huawei brand logo is seen above a store of the telecoms equipment maker in Beijing, China, March 7, 2019. REUTERS/Thomas Peter\n\nUPHILL BATTLE\n\nSome legal experts said Huawei\u2019s lawsuit is likely to be dismissed because U.S. courts are reluctant to second-guess national security determinations by other branches of government.\n\nThe lawsuit \u201cwill be an uphill battle because Congress has broad authority to protect us from perceived national security threats,\u201d said Franklin Turner, a government contracts lawyer at McCarter & English.\n\nIn November, a federal appeals court rejected a similar lawsuit filed by Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab, which was challenging a ban on the use of its software in U.S. government networks.\n\nThe Texas court hearing Huawei\u2019s case will not be bound by that decision, but will likely adopt its reasoning because of similarities in the two disputes, said Steven Schwinn, a professor at the John Marshall Law School in Chicago.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how (Huawei) can really escape that result,\u201d said Schwinn.\n\nHuawei\u2019s chief legal officer, Song Liuping, said the two cases were different in terms of evidence and scope, and that the Chinese company\u2019s case had \u201cfull merits.\u201d\n\nIf a judge decides Huawei has a plausible claim, the case will proceed to the discovery phase, in which internal documents are shared and U.S. government officials could be forced to provide testimony and lay out their security concerns.\n\nRETRIBUTION\n\nThe legal action compares with a more restrained response in December emphasizing \u201ctrust in justice\u201d after the arrest of Chief Financial Officer Sabrina Meng Wanzhou.\n\nA man enters a Huawei shop in Beijing, China, March 7, 2019. REUTERS/Thomas Peter\n\nHuawei founder Ren Zhengfei later said Meng\u2019s arrest was politically motivated and \u201cnot acceptable.\u201d\n\nMeng - Ren\u2019s daughter - is accused by the United States of bank and wire fraud related to breaches of trade sanctions against Iran. Canada approved extradition proceedings on March 1, but Meng has since sued Canada\u2019s government for procedural wrongs in her arrest. The next court hearing is set for May 8.\n\nThe case strained Canada\u2019s relations with China, which this week accused two arrested Canadians of stealing state secrets and blocked Canadian canola imports.\n\nMeng is under house arrest in Vancouver. It is unclear where the two Canadians are being detained in China, and at least one does not have access to legal representation, sources previously told Reuters.",

She denies wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cOne month before that arrest, she wanted to resign and find a job elsewhere.

    "text": "(Reuters) - The surprise arrest of Huawei\u2019s chief financial officer in December quickly turned the executive, Meng Wanzhou, into a central figure in a trade war between two economic superpowers.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A researcher works at a laboratory inside the headquarters of the Chinese telecommunications equipment and smartphone maker Huawei in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China March 6, 2019. REUTERS/Yuyang Wang\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump told Reuters he would consider intervening in her case - a potential action he alluded to again two weeks ago - if it would help close a trade deal with China.\n\nMeng\u2019s lawyer on Wednesday told a Canadian court that he has concerns the allegations against her have a political character, noting Trump\u2019s comments on the case.\n\nBut U.S. probes of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd for allegedly evading U.S. sanctions on Iran were not rooted in Trump\u2019s trade aspirations. Long before Trump initiated a bitter trade war with China, Huawei activities were under scrutiny by U.S. authorities, according to interviews with ten people familiar with the Huawei probes and documents related to the investigations seen by Reuters.\n\nThe U.S. focus on Huawei intensified after years of investigation into smaller Chinese rival ZTE Corp, and relied in part on information collected from devices of company employees traveling through airports.\n\nTwo of the sources said a critical point took place in August 2017, when deputy U.S. Attorney General Rod Rosenstein - best known for his oversight of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe of Russian interference in the U.S. election \u2013 handed a lead role to Brooklyn prosecutors to pursue possible bank fraud charges against Huawei.\n\nFifteen months later, that strategy would help land Meng in a Canadian jail.\n\nThe U.S. investigations of China\u2019s top telecom companies were spurred by reports by Reuters over six years ago, detailing possible Iran sanctions violations by both ZTE and Huawei, as well as close ties between Huawei and Skycom Tech Co Ltd - a suspected front company doing business in Iran.\n\nA spokesman for Huawei, the world\u2019s largest telecommunications equipment maker, has denied the charges in the sanctions case, and did not provide further comment to Reuters. Meng has said she is innocent of the charges. ZTE, which pleaded guilty in 2017 for illegally shipping U.S. goods to Iran, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nU.S. Justice Department spokeswoman Nicole Navas Oxman said the government pursues cases \u201cfree of any political interference and follows the evidence and rule of law in pursuing criminal charges.\u201d\n\nAIRPORT EVIDENCE GRAB\n\nOn December 1, 2018, Meng was stopped at Vancouver International Airport as she walked up the jetway after her flight, according to a lawsuit she filed on Friday accusing the Canadian government of violating her rights. Border officers examined her passport and escorted her to an area for secondary screenings.\n\nWhile there, she was instructed to surrender her two mobile phones, an iPad and a personal computer, along with their passwords, the suit alleges, and the officers viewed the devices\u2019 contents.\n\nReuters has not been able to determine what information was found on Meng\u2019s devices, but it is not the first time she and other Chinese telecom executives have turned over such property to border patrol agents.\n\nIn the years leading up to the Huawei indictment, U.S. officials had been capturing information that would influence the investigation when telecom executives passed through U.S. airports, according to a number of sources familiar with the Huawei and ZTE investigations and the Meng indictment.\n\nFor example, Meng arrived in the United States via John F. Kennedy International Airport in early 2014. The indictment says investigators found \u201csuggested talking points\u201d on one of her electronic devices, stating among other things that Huawei\u2019s relationship with Skycom was \u201cnormal business cooperation.\u201d\n\nMeng had been pulled into a secondary screening at the airport that time as well, and her electronic devices were taken, according to one person familiar with the stop. After a couple of hours, the devices were returned and she was freed to go, the person said.\n\nAnother border search, this time on September 12, 2014, of executives from rival ZTE also supported U.S. investigators long-held suspicions of how Huawei might have been doing illicit business in countries subject to U.S. sanctions, one of the sources told Reuters.\n\nZTE\u2019s CFO at the time was stopped at Boston\u2019s Logan Airport after flying in from London with an assistant, the person said.\n\nThe assistant was carrying a Lenovo laptop containing a confidential ZTE document, dated August 25, 2011 and signed by four top executives, about the need to establish front companies to supply U.S. procured items needed for projects in embargoed countries.\n\nThe airport stop provided key evidence against ZTE in its legal battle with the United States, according to U.S. officials. But it also identified a company as \u201cF7\u201d and how it used a front company to serve as its agent for contracts in sanctioned countries. F7 was Huawei, according to the individuals familiar with the ZTE and Huawei investigations.\n\nThe document was posted on the U.S. Commerce Department website in March 2016 when ZTE was placed on a list of companies that were restricted from buying parts and components from U.S. suppliers. Shortly after the public posting, the New York Times reported that the description of F7 offered by ZTE matched Huawei.\n\nA month later, the Commerce Department sent a subpoena to Huawei in the United States demanding information on the company\u2019s exporting American technology to Iran, according to a court document and one of the people familiar with the Huawei probe.\n\nFROM ZTE TO HUAWEI\n\nWith the case against ZTE wrapping up, more than a dozen people from Departments of Treasury, Commerce, Homeland Security and Justice, gathered in Washington on February 14, 2017 and talked about how they were moving forward against Huawei, according to a person familiar with matter.\n\nBrooklyn prosecutors discussed the relationship between Huawei and HSBC, a bank that was required to cooperate with U.S. prosecutors in any investigation until the end of 2017 for violating U.S. anti-money laundering and sanctions laws, the person added.\n\nIn late 2016, HSBC began to conduct an internal bank probe of Huawei. In the weeks and months following the meeting, HSBC helped authorities obtain evidence of links between Skycom and Huawei, documents reviewed by Reuters show. The probe found Meng met in 2013 with a HSBC banker. She later gave him a copy of the PowerPoint presentation, which the U.S. indictment says misrepresented Huawei\u2019s control of Skycom.\n\nHSBC told Reuters that it provided information in response to demands from the Justice Department.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in Washington, D.C., meanwhile, pursued a more traditional export control investigation against Huawei, which included the accusations of attempted illegal shipments of computers to Iran disclosed in the Reuters 2012 story.\n\nA grand jury subpoena was issued to the U.S subsidiary of the company in April 2017, the first clear sign to Huawei that the probe had turned criminal.\n\nArmed with that knowledge, the company moved U.S.-based Chinese employees who knew about its Iranian dealings out of the country and otherwise concealed and destroyed evidence, the prosecutors allege. Meng and other Huawei executives also began to avoid travel to the United States, prosecutors say.\n\nIn the late summer of 2017, according to two of the sources close to the Huawei investigation, Rosenstein chose Brooklyn as the venue to file charges and the Washington U.S. Attorney\u2019s office dropped out of the case. Brooklyn was already working with a money laundering unit at the Justice Department. The national security division also merged with the Brooklyn prosecution team.\n\nLegal experts said since most evidence of any illegal U.S. goods in Iran presumably existed outside the jurisdiction of U.S. authorities, the bank fraud route presented a potentially quicker path to indictment. They added that bank fraud charges are more likely to lead to arrest by other countries for extradition to the United States than export controls or sanctions violations, and have a longer statute of limitations.\n\nMeng and the company were charged with bank and wire fraud. The PowerPoint presentation\u2019s \u201cnumerous misrepresentations\u201d were central to the charges brought against Meng herself, the indictment shows.\n\nTwelve months after Brooklyn got the case, prosecutors secretly obtained a warrant for Meng\u2019s arrest.\n\nLess than four months later they learned she was stopping in Vancouver en route to Mexico on December 1, and asked the Canadians to detain her at the airport.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Huawei partner offered embargoed HP gear to Iran - reut.rs/2sRL7Ve\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Huawei CFO linked to firm that offered HP gear to Iran - reut.rs/2sUq8RT\n\nEXCLUSIVE: China's ZTE planned U.S. computer sale to Iran - reut.rs/2T17JlN\n\nChinese firm (ZTE) helps Iran spy on citizens - reut.rs/2TlJJJq",

Canada arrested the daughter of Huawei's founder at the request of the U.S. on Dec. 1 at Vancouver's airport. Meng is wanted on fraud charges that she misled banks about the company's business dealings in Iran.\n\nThe suit alleges that instead of immediately arresting her, authorities interrogated Meng \"under the guise of a routine customs\" examination and used the opportunity to \"compel her to provide evidence and information.\" The suit alleges Canada Border Service Agency agents seized her electronic devices, obtained passwords and unlawfully viewed the contents and intentionally failed to adviser her of the true reasons for her detention. The suit said only after three hours was she told she was under arrest and had right to counsel.\n\nMeng is out on bail and living in Vancouver awaiting extradition proceedings.\n\nOn Friday, Canadian Justice Department officials gave the go-ahead for her extradition proceedings to begin. Meng is due in court Wednesday to set a date for the proceedings to start. It could be several months or even years before her case is resolved.\n\nRead more: Huawei just swiped at the US, saying it has 'no evidence, nothing,' of Chinese spying\n\nMeng's arrest set off a diplomatic furor and severely strained Canadian relations with China.

Huawei's corporate senior vice president and director of the board, Chen Lifang, said \"the incident caused damage to the Huawei brand.\"\n\nLast year, Huawei was caught passing off photos taken with a DSLR as images from its P9 smartphone camera.\n\nWhether Meng really is a big fan of Apple products is something we may never know, but it's still crazy to see a Huawei exec caught with so many of a competitor's products. Maybe next time, she should keep a MateBook X Pro in her bag.",

    "text": "HONG KONG/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Chinese telecoms equipment maker Huawei Technologies sued the U.S. government on Thursday, saying a law limiting its American business was unconstitutional, ratcheting up its fight back against a government bent on closing it out of global markets.\n\nHuawei said it had filed a complaint in a federal court in Texas challenging Section 889 of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), signed into law by U.S. President Donald Trump in August, which bars federal agencies and their contractors from procuring its equipment and services.\n\nThe lawsuit marks the latest confrontation between China and the United States, which spent most of 2018 slapping import tariffs on billions of dollars worth of each other\u2019s goods. The year ended with the arrest of Huawei\u2019s chief financial officer in Canada at U.S. request, to the consternation of China.\n\nLong before Trump initiated the trade war, Huawei\u2019s activities were under scrutiny by U.S. authorities, according to interviews with 10 people familiar with the Huawei probes and documents related to the investigations seen by Reuters.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Congress has repeatedly failed to produce any evidence to support its restrictions on Huawei products. We are compelled to take this legal action as a proper and last resort,\u201d Huawei Rotating Chairman Guo Ping said in a statement.\n\n\u201cThis ban not only is unlawful, but also restricts Huawei from engaging in fair competition, ultimately harming U.S. consumers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe look forward to the court\u2019s verdict.\u201d\n\nWhile Huawei had very little share of the U.S. market before the bill, it is the world\u2019s biggest telecoms gear maker and is seeking to be at the forefront of a global rollout of fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks and services.\n\nIn its lawsuit, Huawei said its \u201cequipment and services are subject to advanced security procedures, and no backdoors, implants, or other intentional security vulnerabilities have been documented in any of the more than 170 countries in the world where Huawei equipment and services are used.\u201d\n\nThe privately owned firm has embarked on a public relations and legal offensive as Washington lobbies allies to abandon Huawei when building 5G networks, focusing on a 2017 Chinese law requiring companies to cooperate with national intelligence work.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. Government is sparing no effort to smear the company and mislead the public,\u201d Guo said in a news briefing at Huawei\u2019s headquarters in southern China.\n\nThe U.S. State Department declined comment on the lawsuit on Thursday.\n\n\u201cMore generally,\u201d State Department spokesman Robert Palladino told reporters, \u201cthe United States advocates for secure telecom networks and supply chains that are free from suppliers subject to foreign government control or undue influence which would pose risks of unauthorized access and malicious cyber activity.\u201d\n\nU.S. Representative Mike Conaway, a Texas Republican who has sponsored anti-Huawei legislation, called the Huawei lawsuit \u201cbogus.\u201d\n\n\u201cNO PROOF\u201d\n\nThe NDAA bans the U.S. government from doing business with Huawei or compatriot peer ZTE Corp or from doing business with any company that has equipment from the two companies as a \u201csubstantial or essential component\u201d of their system.\n\nIn its lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Texas, Huawei argues that the section in question is illegal because it could sharply limit the company\u2019s ability to do business in the United States despite no proof of wrongdoing.\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges that Huawei has been denied due process and that Congress, by stripping Huawei of commercial opportunities, has violated the \u201cseparation of powers\u201d portion of the U.S. Constitution by doing the work of the courts.\n\nChinese foreign ministry spokesman Lu Kang said he had no information on whether China\u2019s government may also seek legal action against the U.S. law, but added Huawei\u2019s move is \u201ctotally reasonable and totally understandable.\u201d\n\nThe Huawei brand logo is seen above a store of the telecoms equipment maker in Beijing, China, March 7, 2019. REUTERS/Thomas Peter\n\nUPHILL BATTLE\n\nSome legal experts said Huawei\u2019s lawsuit is likely to be dismissed because U.S. courts are reluctant to second-guess national security determinations by other branches of government.\n\nThe lawsuit \u201cwill be an uphill battle because Congress has broad authority to protect us from perceived national security threats,\u201d said Franklin Turner, a government contracts lawyer at McCarter & English.\n\nIn November, a federal appeals court rejected a similar lawsuit filed by Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab, which was challenging a ban on the use of its software in U.S. government networks.\n\nThe Texas court hearing Huawei\u2019s case will not be bound by that decision, but will likely adopt its reasoning because of similarities in the two disputes, said Steven Schwinn, a professor at the John Marshall Law School in Chicago.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see how (Huawei) can really escape that result,\u201d said Schwinn.\n\nHuawei\u2019s chief legal officer, Song Liuping, said the two cases were different in terms of evidence and scope, and that the Chinese company\u2019s case had \u201cfull merits.\u201d\n\nIf a judge decides Huawei has a plausible claim, the case will proceed to the discovery phase, in which internal documents are shared and U.S. government officials could be forced to provide testimony and lay out their security concerns.\n\nRETRIBUTION\n\nThe legal action compares with a more restrained response in December emphasizing \u201ctrust in justice\u201d after the arrest of Chief Financial Officer Sabrina Meng Wanzhou.\n\nA man enters a Huawei shop in Beijing, China, March 7, 2019. REUTERS/Thomas Peter\n\nHuawei founder Ren Zhengfei later said Meng\u2019s arrest was politically motivated and \u201cnot acceptable.\u201d\n\nMeng - Ren\u2019s daughter - is accused by the United States of bank and wire fraud related to breaches of trade sanctions against Iran. Canada approved extradition proceedings on March 1, but Meng has since sued Canada\u2019s government for procedural wrongs in her arrest. The next court hearing is set for May 8.\n\nThe case strained Canada\u2019s relations with China, which this week accused two arrested Canadians of stealing state secrets and blocked Canadian canola imports.\n\nMeng is under house arrest in Vancouver. It is unclear where the two Canadians are being detained in China, and at least one does not have access to legal representation, sources previously told Reuters.",

Finally, the company CFO Wanzhou Meng, arrested in Canada last December, is still awaiting possible extradition to the U.S., where she is charged for wire fraud and bank fraud.\n\nHuawei\u2019s 2018 revenue and net profit see double digit growth, 19.5% and 25.1% respectively. Read our annual report to learn more about the statistics and the facts behind the advancement: https://t.co/ffme3oYyKI pic.twitter.com/VDHifR5tpn \u2014 Huawei Technologies (@Huawei) March 29, 2019\n\nBut looking at the company's earnings report, you'd think that Huawei's never been doing better. The company sold more than 200 million phones in 2018, and ended the year as the third largest smartphone maker by shipments, behind Samsung and Apple, according to Gartner and Canalys (Huawei temporarily overtook Apple to become the global number two smartphone maker in August last year). But Huawei is making more money than ever from phone sales. The company's consumer business is booming, having grown 45.1 percent year-over-year. Its carrier business \u2014 which includes the company's 5G equipment business \u2014 was down slightly (1.3 percent) compared to 2017, but that's unsurprising given all the negative press and outright bans in some places.\n\nJust days ago, the company launched a new flagship smartphone, the Huawei P30 Pro, at a lavish event in Paris. Its pricing in Europe is slightly higher than that of its predecessor, the P20 Pro at launch, and the P20 Pro was more expensive than the P10. That's hardly surprising \u2014 with sales booming, Huawei's able to raise prices of its products, which are now on par with flagship product prices of its nearest competitors, Samsung and Apple. In fact, the Huawei Mate X \u2014 a snazzy folding phone which is yet to hit the market \u2014 is priced even higher than the upcoming folding phone from Samsung. By some measures, it's also more promising, as well.\n\nHere's the kicker: Despite all the negative press, the company feels it can sustain this growth in the future. According to CNBC, Huawei chairman Guo Ping said the company's revenue grew 30 percent year-over-year in January and February, and that Huawei expects double-digit growth in 2019. After a year like this, it doesn't seem impossible.",

REUTERS/Nigel Treblin\n\nBy Jonathan Weber and Sijia Jiang\n\nSHENZHEN/HONG KONG (Reuters) - The U.S. campaign against China\u2019s Huawei is having little impact on the company\u2019s sales and it is unlikely many countries will follow the United States in banning Huawei from building next-generation mobile networks, its rotating Chairman Eric Xu said.\n\n\u201cRecently we are seeing a large number of countries making their own decisions,\u201d Xu said during an interview at Huawei Technologies\u2019 headquarters in Shenzhen.\n\nWhile Australia has banned Huawei from 5G networks over security concerns, European Union countries such as Germany and France have indicated they are likely to ignore the U.S. call to shut out the telecoms giant.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s only Australia,\u201d Xu told Reuters reporters after a tour of the campus.\n\nXu affirmed that Huawei\u2019s revenue jumped 36 percent over the first two months of 2019 and was set for a 15 percent annual spike to $125 billion, underlining strength in its smartphone business and sales of computing and communications networks.\n\nHuawei has been facing mounting scrutiny, led by the United States, amid worries its equipment could be used by Beijing for spying. The company, however, says the concerns are unfounded.\n\nXu said he does not expect the United States to intensify its attack on the company by barring sales of U.S. components to Huawei, a move that almost put its compatriot ZTE Corp out of business last year before U.S. President Donald Trump lifted the ban.\n\nHuawei is the world\u2019s third-largest buyer of computer chips, many of which come from U.S. companies, and a sales ban would be disruptive to the global tech industry, Xu said.\n\nXu\u2019s comments come at a time when Huawei has sued the U.S. government over a law that restricts its market access.\n\nIn Canada, lawyers for Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of founder Ren Zhengfei, have sued the government over her Dec. 1 arrest at the behest of the United States. She was charged with bank and wire fraud to violate U.S. sanctions against Iran.\n\nCAMPUS TOUR\n\nHuawei, a privately held firm that offers few details about its internal operations, has in recent months offered media interviews and invited journalists to tour its facilities as part of a counter-attack against the allegations of spying.\n\nReuters reporters were invited on Monday to peruse files in Huawei\u2019s \u201cshare registry room\u201d where it keeps records on tens of thousands of employee shareholders.\n\nHuawei said the records show that the firm is owned by its employees and that its 74-year-old founder Ren owns just over 1 percent of the company. Reuters could not independently verify the ownership structure.\n\nMuch of the global scrutiny of Huawei stems from Ren\u2019s background with China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army, where he was a civilian engineer for nearly a decade until his departure in 1983 after helping to build its communications network.\n\nReuters also toured Huawei\u2019s new campus in Dongguan, near Shenzhen, that features buildings modeled on European cities including Paris and Heidelberg, connected by a special train imported from Switzerland.\n\nHowever, there was little activity on the campus, which is designed to house 18,000 workers, save a couple of black swans flitting about a lake.\n\nIn contrast, another Huawei facility nearby bustled with workers assembling smartphones on automated production lines.\n\nNEW GROWTH DRIVERS\n\nHuawei\u2019s growth is mainly being driven by its booming smartphone business and sales of computing and communications networks to government and business customers.\n\nFuture growth will also come \u201cprimarily\u201d from these, Xu said, with sales of equipment to telecom carriers growing at single digit rates.\n\nHuawei is the world\u2019s top producer of telecoms equipment and third-biggest maker of smartphones.\n\nOn Huawei\u2019s semiconductor operations, HiSilicon, Xu said the unit produced more than $7.5 billion worth of chips last year. That compares with an estimated $21 billon of chips that Huawei acquired from outside vendors.\n\nHiSilicon produces chip designs for Huawei\u2019s equipment mainly, with the manufacturing handled by so-called \u201cfoundry\u201d companies such as Taiwan\u2019s TSMC.\n\nSlideshow (20 Images)\n\nIt does sell chips to others for use in video cameras, television set-top boxes and some low-cost internet-connected devices, Xu said.\n\nHuawei will report its 2018 financial results at a press briefing on Friday, which over a hundred journalists are expected to attend, far more than in past years.\n\n\u201cThe United States should take quite a lot of the credit for making advertisements for Huawei,\u201d Xu quipped.",

    "description": "The surprise arrest of Huawei's chief financial officer in December quickly turned the executive, Meng Wanzhou, into a central figure in a trade war between two economic superpowers.",
    "text": "(Repeats to additional customers with no changes to text)\n\nBy Karen Freifeld\n\nMarch 6 (Reuters) - The surprise arrest of Huawei\u2019s chief financial officer in December quickly turned the executive, Meng Wanzhou, into a central figure in a trade war between two economic superpowers.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump told Reuters he would consider intervening in her case - a potential action he alluded to again two weeks ago - if it would help close a trade deal with China.\n\nMeng\u2019s lawyer on Wednesday told a Canadian court that he has concerns the allegations against her have a political character, noting Trump\u2019s comments on the case.\n\nBut U.S. probes of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd for allegedly evading U.S. sanctions on Iran were not rooted in Trump\u2019s trade aspirations. Long before Trump initiated a bitter trade war with China, Huawei activities were under scrutiny by U.S. authorities, according to interviews with ten people familiar with the Huawei probes and documents related to the investigations seen by Reuters.\n\nThe U.S. focus on Huawei intensified after years of investigation into smaller Chinese rival ZTE Corp , and relied in part on information collected from devices of company employees traveling through airports.\n\nTwo of the sources said a critical point took place in August 2017, when deputy U.S. Attorney General Rod Rosenstein - best known for his oversight of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe of Russian interference in the U.S. election \u2013 handed a lead role to Brooklyn prosecutors to pursue possible bank fraud charges against Huawei.\n\nFifteen months later, that strategy would help land Meng in a Canadian jail.\n\nThe U.S. investigations of China\u2019s top telecom companies were spurred by reports by Reuters over six years ago, detailing possible Iran sanctions violations by both ZTE and Huawei, as well as close ties between Huawei and Skycom Tech Co Ltd - a suspected front company doing business in Iran. Click here reut.rs/2sRL7Ve and here reut.rs/2sUq8RT to read the stories.\n\nA spokesman for Huawei, the world\u2019s largest telecommunications equipment maker, has denied the charges in the sanctions case, and did not provide further comment to Reuters. Meng has said she is innocent of the charges. ZTE, which pleaded guilty in 2017 for illegally shipping U.S. goods to Iran, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nU.S. Justice Department spokeswoman Nicole Navas Oxman said the government pursues cases \u201cfree of any political interference and follows the evidence and rule of law in pursuing criminal charges.\u201d\n\nAIRPORT EVIDENCE GRAB\n\nOn December 1, 2018, Meng was stopped at Vancouver International Airport as she walked up the jetway after her flight, according to a lawsuit she filed on Friday accusing the Canadian government of violating her rights. Border officers examined her passport and escorted her to an area for secondary screenings.\n\nWhile there, she was instructed to surrender her two mobile phones, an iPad and a personal computer, along with their passwords, the suit alleges, and the officers viewed the devices\u2019 contents.\n\nReuters has not been able to determine what information was found on Meng\u2019s devices, but it is not the first time she and other Chinese telecom executives have turned over such property to border patrol agents.\n\nIn the years leading up to the Huawei indictment, U.S. officials had been capturing information that would influence the investigation when telecom executives passed through U.S. airports, according to a number of sources familiar with the Huawei and ZTE investigations and the Meng indictment.\n\nFor example, Meng arrived in the United States via John F. Kennedy International Airport in early 2014. The indictment says investigators found \u201csuggested talking points\u201d on one of her electronic devices, stating among other things that Huawei\u2019s relationship with Skycom was \u201cnormal business cooperation.\u201d\n\nMeng had been pulled into a secondary screening at the airport that time as well, and her electronic devices were taken, according to one person familiar with the stop. After a couple of hours, the devices were returned and she was freed to go, the person said.\n\nAnother border search, this time on September 12, 2014, of executives from rival ZTE also supported U.S. investigators long-held suspicions of how Huawei might have been doing illicit business in countries subject to U.S. sanctions, one of the sources told Reuters.\n\nZTE\u2019s CFO at the time was stopped at Boston\u2019s Logan Airport after flying in from London with an assistant, the person said.\n\nThe assistant was carrying a Lenovo laptop containing a confidential ZTE document, dated August 25, 2011 and signed by four top executives, about the need to establish front companies to supply U.S. procured items needed for projects in embargoed countries.\n\nThe airport stop provided key evidence against ZTE in its legal battle with the United States, according to U.S. officials. But it also identified a company as \u201cF7\u201d and how it used a front company to serve as its agent for contracts in sanctioned countries. F7 was Huawei, according to the individuals familiar with the ZTE and Huawei investigations.\n\nThe document was posted on the U.S. Commerce Department website in March 2016 when ZTE was placed on a list of companies that were restricted from buying parts and components from U.S. suppliers. Shortly after the public posting, the New York Times reported that the description of F7 offered by ZTE matched Huawei.\n\nA month later, the Commerce Department sent a subpoena to Huawei in the United States demanding information on the company\u2019s exporting American technology to Iran, according to a court document and one of the people familiar with the Huawei probe.\n\nFROM ZTE TO HUAWEI\n\nWith the case against ZTE wrapping up, more than a dozen people from Departments of Treasury, Commerce, Homeland Security and Justice, gathered in Washington on February 14, 2017 and talked about how they were moving forward against Huawei, according to a person familiar with matter.\n\nBrooklyn prosecutors discussed the relationship between Huawei and HSBC, a bank that was required to cooperate with U.S. prosecutors in any investigation until the end of 2017 for violating U.S. anti-money laundering and sanctions laws, the person added.\n\nIn late 2016, HSBC began to conduct an internal bank probe of Huawei. In the weeks and months following the meeting, HSBC helped authorities obtain evidence of links between Skycom and Huawei, documents reviewed by Reuters show. The probe found Meng met in 2013 with a HSBC banker. She later gave him a copy of the PowerPoint presentation, which the U.S. indictment says misrepresented Huawei\u2019s control of Skycom.\n\nHSBC told Reuters that it provided information in response to demands from the Justice Department.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in Washington, D.C., meanwhile, pursued a more traditional export control investigation against Huawei, which included the accusations of attempted illegal shipments of computers to Iran disclosed in the Reuters 2012 story.\n\nA grand jury subpoena was issued to the U.S subsidiary of the company in April 2017, the first clear sign to Huawei that the probe had turned criminal.\n\nArmed with that knowledge, the company moved U.S.-based Chinese employees who knew about its Iranian dealings out of the country and otherwise concealed and destroyed evidence, the prosecutors allege. Meng and other Huawei executives also began to avoid travel to the United States, prosecutors say.\n\nIn the late summer of 2017, according to two of the sources close to the Huawei investigation, Rosenstein chose Brooklyn as the venue to file charges and the Washington U.S. Attorney\u2019s office dropped out of the case. Brooklyn was already working with a money laundering unit at the Justice Department. The national security division also merged with the Brooklyn prosecution team.\n\nLegal experts said since most evidence of any illegal U.S. goods in Iran presumably existed outside the jurisdiction of U.S. authorities, the bank fraud route presented a potentially quicker path to indictment. They added that bank fraud charges are more likely to lead to arrest by other countries for extradition to the United States than export controls or sanctions violations, and have a longer statute of limitations.\n\nMeng and the company were charged with bank and wire fraud. The PowerPoint presentation\u2019s \u201cnumerous misrepresentations\u201d were central to the charges brought against Meng herself, the indictment shows.\n\nTwelve months after Brooklyn got the case, prosecutors secretly obtained a warrant for Meng\u2019s arrest.\n\nLess than four months later they learned she was stopping in Vancouver en route to Mexico on December 1, and asked the Canadians to detain her at the airport.",

Specifically, the company reportedly plans to sue the US for barring federal agencies from using Huawei tech.\n\nThe US has long voiced concerns that Huawei technology \u2014 along with its fellow Chinese telecom company ZTE \u2014 could pose a security risk, fearing that the company's technology could act as a backdoor for the Chinese government to spy.\n\nHuawei denies the allegations and last week returned fire, criticizing a new, wide-reaching American law that allows the US government to demand data stored with Amazon, Microsoft, or other cloud providers.\n\nRead more: The Trump administration is warning allies to stay away from a powerful Chinese company \u2014 but not everyone is listening\n\nAccording to The Times, Huawei's suit will center on a section of a defense-spending-authorization law that was enacted last year, blocking federal agencies from using Huawei and ZTE telecom equipment.\n\nOne of the sources told The Times that Huawei was likely to argue the provision to be a \"bill of attainder,\" a law that singles out a person or group of people as guilty of a crime and prescribes their punishment without trial. Bills of attainder are banned by the US Constitution.\n\nThis week has also seen a Huawei executive take legal action against Canada.

    "text": "An executive of Chinese tech giant Huawei is suing the Canadian government, its border agency and the national police force, saying they detained, searched and interrogated her before telling her she was under arrest.\n\nLawyers for Meng Wanzhou said Sunday they filed a notice of civil claim in the British Columbia Supreme Court.\n\nCanada arrested Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, at the request of the U.S. on December 1 at Vancouver's airport. She is wanted on fraud charges that she misled banks about the company's business dealings in Iran.\n\nMeng Wanzhou (pictured January 29) is suing the Canadian government, its border agency and the national police force, saying they detained, searched and interrogated her before telling her she was under arrest\n\nThe suit alleges that instead of immediately arresting her, authorities interrogated Meng 'under the guise of a routine customs' examination and used the opportunity to 'compel her to provide evidence and information.'\n\nThe suit alleges Canada Border Service Agency agents seized her electronic devices, obtained passwords and unlawfully viewed the contents and intentionally failed to advise her of the true reasons for her detention.\n\nThe suit said only after three hours was she told she was under arrest and had right to counsel.\n\n'This case concerns a deliberate and pre-meditated effort on the part of the defendant officers to obtain evidence and information from the plaintiff in a manner which they knew constituted serious violations of the plaintiff's rights,' the claim says.\n\nMeng is out on bail and living in Vancouver awaiting extradition proceedings.\n\nOn Friday, Canadian Justice Department officials gave the go-ahead for her extradition proceedings to begin. Meng is due in court Wednesday to set a date for the proceedings to start. It could be several months or even years before her case is resolved.\n\nMeng's arrest set off a diplomatic furor and severely strained Canadian relations with China. Beijing has accused Washington of a politically motivated attempt to hurt the company.\n\nChina detained former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and Canadian entrepreneur Michael Spavor on December 10 in an apparent attempt to pressure Canada to release Meng.\n\nA Chinese court also sentenced a Canadian to death in a sudden retrial, overturning a 15-year prison term handed down earlier. Kovrig and Spavor haven't had access to a lawyer or to their families since being arrested.\n\nNicolas Dorion, a spokesman for the Canada Border Services Agency, said it's not a practice of the agency to comment on legal matters that are before the courts. A justice department spokesman referred comment to the border agency, and a spokesman for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said they were unlikely to comment Sunday.\n\nGary Botting, a Vancouver extradition lawyer who is not representing Meng, said Canada's Border Services Agency tends to overstep.\n\n'They took her under custody without telling her why,' Botting said. 'They disguised the real reason why they detained her. Her rights were violated.'\n\nBotting said they had no reason to detain her as she had travelled to Canada many times before. 'They are trying to get all this information ahead of time and they know ultimately an arrest was in the works,' he said.\n\nJulian Ku, senior associate dean for academic affairs at Hofstra Law, noted the civil action is separate and apart from Meng's extradition proceeding. He said the lawsuit will allow her to argue she is being unfairly treated and support her broader public relations claim that the detention is part of a U.S and Canadian political conspiracy against Huawei.\n\nLynette Ong, an associate professor of political science at the University of Toronto who focuses on China, quipped that the detained Canadians should take Beijing to court for violation of basic human rights, taking a leaf from the Meng lawsuit.\n\n'The violation of their human rights is so much more grave than violation of her constitutional rights,' Ong said. 'But that's not even possible for them. The fact that they were denied a lawyer in the first place means they are not entitled to any justice.'",

    "title": "Why is Justin Trudeau in trouble?",
    "description": "A scandal has cost him two cabinet ministers",
    "text": "ALLEGATIONS THAT Justin Trudeau, Canada\u2019s prime minister, put pressure last year on Jody Wilson-Raybould, then justice minister and attorney-general, to drop a criminal case against a large construction company have dominated the news for almost a month. Ms Wilson-Raybould says that the Liberal prime minister and his officials pushed her to suspend the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin for bribing Libyan officials prior to 2011, and fine the company instead. Mr Trudeau admits that he raised the matter with Ms Wilson-Raybould because he wanted to protect 9,000 jobs, but denies that he and his officials did anything inappropriate. He did not override Ms Wilson-Raybould\u2019s decision to proceed with a trial. And she has not accused him or his aides of criminal behaviour. So why is Mr Trudeau in trouble?\n\nWhen Mr Trudeau led the Liberals to victory in the election in October 2015, he called himself a feminist, promised to improve Canada\u2019s troubled relations with indigenous peoples and pledged to conduct an open and transparent government. These promises look empty after Ms Wilson-Raybould, an indigenous politician, told the parliamentary justice committee investigating the affair on February 27th that the prime minister and his officials had tried to strong-arm her. The most senior bureaucrat in Ottawa issued \u201cveiled threats\u201d of what would happen if she did not change her mind, she testified. (That bureaucrat, who has testified previously, is due to appear before the committee again on March 6th.) She believes that she was demoted in January to the more junior post of minister of veterans\u2019 affairs as punishment for resisting. She resigned from cabinet last month but still sits as a Liberal MP.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nOpposition parties have piled in, hoping to do as much damage as possible to the Liberal brand during this last session of parliament before Canadians vote in the next parliamentary election, due in October. Andrew Scheer, the Conservative leader, says Mr Trudeau should resign. The prime minister\u2019s damage-control efforts received a blow on March 4th when Jane Philpott, one of his most competent and respected ministers, quit as president of the treasury board, the government\u2019s main administrative department. Ms Philpott said the pressure on Ms Wilson-Raybould raised serious concerns about the independence of Canada\u2019s justice system. \u201cSadly, I have lost confidence in how the government has dealt with this matter and how it has responded to the issues raised,\u201d she wrote. China has seized on the controversy to argue that Canada\u2019s judiciary did not behave independently of government when it ordered the arrest in December of Meng Wanzhou, the CFO of Huawei, a big Chinese telecoms company, at the request of American prosecutors. The dispute has poisoned relations between Canada and China.\n\nMr Trudeau faces more pitfalls. Gerald Butts, his former principal secretary, is to testify before the justice committee on March 6th. Ms Wilson-Raybould says he exerted some of the pressure. The parliamentary ethics commissioner and justice committee will issue separate reports. Mr Trudeau must still decide whether he wants Ms Wilson-Raybould and Ms Philpott to remain members of the Liberal caucus now that they have lost confidence in his government. Expelling them could be explosive.\n\nEven before the Globe and Mail, a national newspaper, first published the allegations of backroom pressure on Ms Wilson-Raybould, the Liberals were dropping in the polls. Some indicate that the Conservatives would win if an election were called today. Most Canadians say the economy, rather than issues like SNC-Lavalin, will determine their vote in October. Unfortunately for Mr Trudeau, the latest statistics show that the economy has stopped growing. If Mr Trudeau weathers the SNC-Lavalin scandal, a weaker economy could jeopardise his re-election.",

    "text": "(Reuters) - The surprise arrest of Huawei\u2019s chief financial officer in December quickly turned the executive, Meng Wanzhou, into a central figure in a trade war between two economic superpowers.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A researcher works at a laboratory inside the headquarters of the Chinese telecommunications equipment and smartphone maker Huawei in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China March 6, 2019. REUTERS/Yuyang Wang\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump told Reuters he would consider intervening in her case - a potential action he alluded to again two weeks ago - if it would help close a trade deal with China.\n\nMeng\u2019s lawyer on Wednesday told a Canadian court that he has concerns the allegations against her have a political character, noting Trump\u2019s comments on the case.\n\nBut U.S. probes of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd for allegedly evading U.S. sanctions on Iran were not rooted in Trump\u2019s trade aspirations. Long before Trump initiated a bitter trade war with China, Huawei activities were under scrutiny by U.S. authorities, according to interviews with ten people familiar with the Huawei probes and documents related to the investigations seen by Reuters.\n\nThe U.S. focus on Huawei intensified after years of investigation into smaller Chinese rival ZTE Corp, and relied in part on information collected from devices of company employees traveling through airports.\n\nTwo of the sources said a critical point took place in August 2017, when deputy U.S. Attorney General Rod Rosenstein - best known for his oversight of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe of Russian interference in the U.S. election \u2013 handed a lead role to Brooklyn prosecutors to pursue possible bank fraud charges against Huawei.\n\nFifteen months later, that strategy would help land Meng in a Canadian jail.\n\nThe U.S. investigations of China\u2019s top telecom companies were spurred by reports by Reuters over six years ago, detailing possible Iran sanctions violations by both ZTE and Huawei, as well as close ties between Huawei and Skycom Tech Co Ltd - a suspected front company doing business in Iran.\n\nA spokesman for Huawei, the world\u2019s largest telecommunications equipment maker, has denied the charges in the sanctions case, and did not provide further comment to Reuters. Meng has said she is innocent of the charges. ZTE, which pleaded guilty in 2017 for illegally shipping U.S. goods to Iran, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nU.S. Justice Department spokeswoman Nicole Navas Oxman said the government pursues cases \u201cfree of any political interference and follows the evidence and rule of law in pursuing criminal charges.\u201d\n\nAIRPORT EVIDENCE GRAB\n\nOn December 1, 2018, Meng was stopped at Vancouver International Airport as she walked up the jetway after her flight, according to a lawsuit she filed on Friday accusing the Canadian government of violating her rights. Border officers examined her passport and escorted her to an area for secondary screenings.\n\nWhile there, she was instructed to surrender her two mobile phones, an iPad and a personal computer, along with their passwords, the suit alleges, and the officers viewed the devices\u2019 contents.\n\nReuters has not been able to determine what information was found on Meng\u2019s devices, but it is not the first time she and other Chinese telecom executives have turned over such property to border patrol agents.\n\nIn the years leading up to the Huawei indictment, U.S. officials had been capturing information that would influence the investigation when telecom executives passed through U.S. airports, according to a number of sources familiar with the Huawei and ZTE investigations and the Meng indictment.\n\nFor example, Meng arrived in the United States via John F. Kennedy International Airport in early 2014. The indictment says investigators found \u201csuggested talking points\u201d on one of her electronic devices, stating among other things that Huawei\u2019s relationship with Skycom was \u201cnormal business cooperation.\u201d\n\nMeng had been pulled into a secondary screening at the airport that time as well, and her electronic devices were taken, according to one person familiar with the stop. After a couple of hours, the devices were returned and she was freed to go, the person said.\n\nAnother border search, this time on September 12, 2014, of executives from rival ZTE also supported U.S. investigators long-held suspicions of how Huawei might have been doing illicit business in countries subject to U.S. sanctions, one of the sources told Reuters.\n\nZTE\u2019s CFO at the time was stopped at Boston\u2019s Logan Airport after flying in from London with an assistant, the person said.\n\nThe assistant was carrying a Lenovo laptop containing a confidential ZTE document, dated August 25, 2011 and signed by four top executives, about the need to establish front companies to supply U.S. procured items needed for projects in embargoed countries.\n\nThe airport stop provided key evidence against ZTE in its legal battle with the United States, according to U.S. officials. But it also identified a company as \u201cF7\u201d and how it used a front company to serve as its agent for contracts in sanctioned countries. F7 was Huawei, according to the individuals familiar with the ZTE and Huawei investigations.\n\nThe document was posted on the U.S. Commerce Department website in March 2016 when ZTE was placed on a list of companies that were restricted from buying parts and components from U.S. suppliers. Shortly after the public posting, the New York Times reported that the description of F7 offered by ZTE matched Huawei.\n\nA month later, the Commerce Department sent a subpoena to Huawei in the United States demanding information on the company\u2019s exporting American technology to Iran, according to a court document and one of the people familiar with the Huawei probe.\n\nFROM ZTE TO HUAWEI\n\nWith the case against ZTE wrapping up, more than a dozen people from Departments of Treasury, Commerce, Homeland Security and Justice, gathered in Washington on February 14, 2017 and talked about how they were moving forward against Huawei, according to a person familiar with matter.\n\nBrooklyn prosecutors discussed the relationship between Huawei and HSBC, a bank that was required to cooperate with U.S. prosecutors in any investigation until the end of 2017 for violating U.S. anti-money laundering and sanctions laws, the person added.\n\nIn late 2016, HSBC began to conduct an internal bank probe of Huawei. In the weeks and months following the meeting, HSBC helped authorities obtain evidence of links between Skycom and Huawei, documents reviewed by Reuters show. The probe found Meng met in 2013 with a HSBC banker. She later gave him a copy of the PowerPoint presentation, which the U.S. indictment says misrepresented Huawei\u2019s control of Skycom.\n\nHSBC told Reuters that it provided information in response to demands from the Justice Department.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in Washington, D.C., meanwhile, pursued a more traditional export control investigation against Huawei, which included the accusations of attempted illegal shipments of computers to Iran disclosed in the Reuters 2012 story.\n\nA grand jury subpoena was issued to the U.S subsidiary of the company in April 2017, the first clear sign to Huawei that the probe had turned criminal.\n\nArmed with that knowledge, the company moved U.S.-based Chinese employees who knew about its Iranian dealings out of the country and otherwise concealed and destroyed evidence, the prosecutors allege. Meng and other Huawei executives also began to avoid travel to the United States, prosecutors say.\n\nIn the late summer of 2017, according to two of the sources close to the Huawei investigation, Rosenstein chose Brooklyn as the venue to file charges and the Washington U.S. Attorney\u2019s office dropped out of the case. Brooklyn was already working with a money laundering unit at the Justice Department. The national security division also merged with the Brooklyn prosecution team.\n\nLegal experts said since most evidence of any illegal U.S. goods in Iran presumably existed outside the jurisdiction of U.S. authorities, the bank fraud route presented a potentially quicker path to indictment. They added that bank fraud charges are more likely to lead to arrest by other countries for extradition to the United States than export controls or sanctions violations, and have a longer statute of limitations.\n\nMeng and the company were charged with bank and wire fraud. The PowerPoint presentation\u2019s \u201cnumerous misrepresentations\u201d were central to the charges brought against Meng herself, the indictment shows.\n\nTwelve months after Brooklyn got the case, prosecutors secretly obtained a warrant for Meng\u2019s arrest.\n\nLess than four months later they learned she was stopping in Vancouver en route to Mexico on December 1, and asked the Canadians to detain her at the airport.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Huawei partner offered embargoed HP gear to Iran - reut.rs/2sRL7Ve\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Huawei CFO linked to firm that offered HP gear to Iran - reut.rs/2sUq8RT\n\nEXCLUSIVE: China's ZTE planned U.S. computer sale to Iran - reut.rs/2T17JlN\n\nChinese firm (ZTE) helps Iran spy on citizens - reut.rs/2TlJJJq",

She didn't violate any Canadian rules and I think both Canada and Huawei are victims because this case hurts people in both countries and bilateral relations also suffered setbacks,\" said Ren.\n\nHe also said he had previously only communicated infrequently with Meng, given how busy the two were.\n\n\"Now, every other day we have phone calls, we shoot the breeze, tell jokes, I tell her some anecdote I read on the internet. The case in Canada made my bonds deeper with my daughter,\" he said.\n\nHuawei is a major manufacturer of equipment for 5G, the latest generation of cellular mobile communications. Canada is studying whether the firm will be able to bid for 5G contracts, given concerns about how secure the technology is.\n\nWashington said last month that it would not be able to partner with or share information with countries that adopt Huawei systems.\n\n\"Meng Wanzhou is an individual case and I don't think it should influence in any way the relationship Canada has with Huawei,\" said Ren.",

    "text": "A Canadian ex-diplomat detained by China has been accused of stealing state secrets for overseas entities helped by another Canadian citizen, according to Chinese state media.\n\nMichael Kovrig was working for a non-profit organisation when he was detained in Beijing last December on suspicion of carrying out activities that harmed the China's national security.\n\nIt is said that the intelligence had been passed onto Kovrig by Canadian businessman, Michael Spavor, who was also detained by China in December.\n\nMichael Kovrig (pictured) has been accused of stealing state secrets for overseas entities by China, according to Chinese state newspaper Global Times citing a relevant government body\n\nThe Chinese authorities alleged that Kovrig had obtained state secrets and intelligence from another Canadian citizen Michael Spavor (pictured), who was also detained in December\n\nChinese authorities claimed that they had achieved a breakthrough in the investigation of Kovrig's case, according a report on state-run Global Times today, citing information released by a relevant government body.\n\nKovrig has been accused of stealing and spying on state secrets and intelligence from China for overseas entities through his contacts inside China.\n\nAuthorities alleged that Kovrig had carried out such activities since 2017 by entering China with an ordinary passport and business visas.\n\nMichael Spavor, a Canadian businessman who was also detained on suspicion of harming China's national security, is said to have been 'an important contact' for Kovrig and provided intelligence for him.\n\nThe article claimed that Kovrig's behaviour had 'seriously violated the Chinese law' and that China 'will resolutely crack down on any illegal and criminal activities that seriously endanger national security'.\n\nThe relevant government body also promised to provide Kovrig and Spavor's legal rights, the article said.\n\nThe arrests of the two Canadians came after Meng Wanzhou, a top Chinese executive, was arrested in Canada on December 1 last year at the request of the United States.\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and U.S. President Donald Trump denounced China's 'arbitrary detention' of two Canadians during a telephone call last month, officials said.\n\nThe arrests of the two Canadians came after Meng Wanzhou (pictured), a top Chinese executive, was arrested in Canada on December 1 last year at the request of the United States\n\nThe arrest of Meng, the CFO of Chinese tech-giant Huawei, has sparked political tensions between China, Canada and the United States. Meng is awaiting extradition proceedings\n\nWashington accuses Huawei of using a Hong Kong shell company to sell equipment to Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions. Meng is facing extradition to the United States.\n\nThe arrest of Meng has sparked ongoing political tensions between China, Canada and the United States.\n\nAnother Canadian, Robert Lloyd Schellenberg, was sentenced to death in China for drug trafficking last month amid the diplomatic row after the court changed his original 15-year jail sentence.\n\nChina has not drawn a direct link between its detention of the two Canadians and Meng's arrest, but Beijing-based Western diplomats have called the cases a tit-for-tat reprisal.\n\nLast month, more than 100 academics and former diplomats are calling on China to release Kovrig and Spavor in a letter addressed to Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\nThe letter says the arrests of the two Canadians sends a worrisome signal to those who work in policy and research in China.\n\nAnother Canadian, Robert Lloyd Schellenberg (pictured), was sentenced to death in China for drug trafficking last month. The court had changed its original 15-year jail sentence\n\nIt notes Kovrig is a former diplomat who was working as an expert on Asia for the International Crisis Group think tank. It notes that Spavor devoted his time to building relationships between North Korea and China, Canada and United States.\n\nIt praises Kovrig and Spavor as bridge-builders between China and the world and said their arrests make writers 'more cautious' about travelling to China.\n\nThe International Crisis Group, the organisation Kovrig works for, said they were aware of the report but had not heard any official charges laid against Kovrig.\n\nA spokesperson from the Brussels-based non-profit said: 'Michael's work for Crisis Group has been entirely transparent and in the open as all who follow his work can attest.'\n\nThe spokesperson added: 'Vague and unsubstantiated accusations against him are unwarranted and unfair.'\n\nOn the other hand, Meng has sued the Canadian government, its border agency and the national police force over her arrest as the United States continues their bid to get her extradited to face charges\n\nMeng claimed that the Canadian authorities had detained, searched and interrogated her before telling her she was under arrest.\n\nLawyers for Meng said yesterday that they filed a notice of civil claim in the British Columbia Supreme Court.\n\nMeng is out on bail and living in Vancouver awaiting extradition proceedings.",

    "text": "U.S. Warns Germany: Using Huawei Could Crimp Intelligence-Sharing Between Agencies\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Sean Gallup/Getty Images Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n\nThe U.S. has apparently warned Germany that if Chinese tech companies such as Huawei help build the country's new 5G telecom infrastructure, U.S. agencies might not share as much intelligence with the German government as they currently do.\n\nThat's the gist of a letter U.S. Ambassador Richard A. Grenell recently sent to German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier, according to The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the news.\n\n\"A U.S. Embassy spokesman told NPR in a statement that he would not comment on the contents of the letter,\" NPR's Joanna Kakissis reports from Munich. \"But he added that the U.S. position on 5G network security is well-known.\"\n\nThe U.S. has repeatedly urged Germany, Canada and other allies not to use Huawei \u2014 China's largest telecom equipment-maker \u2014 to build sophisticated new telecommunications networks, saying the company has possible ties to Chinese intelligence agencies.\n\nHuawei has denied that it spies for China. But suspicions have increased enough that the company's founder and CEO, Ren Zhengfei, tried to quash them earlier this year, when he said, \"No law requires any company in China to install mandatory backdoors.\"\n\nZhengfei said he wouldn't harm his customers' interests or his company's prospects.\n\nAltmaier apparently received the U.S. letter on Friday \u2014 one day after he said Germany doesn't want to put an outright ban on Huawei. Instead, he said, the country plans to \"change its laws to guarantee all components used in the 5G networks are secure,\" as Deutsche Welle reports.\n\nThe U.S. has been openly skeptical of Huawei's independence since at least 2012, when the House Intelligence Committee issued a report criticizing the tech company over its ties to China's communist government (and possibly the military) as well as a lack of transparency.\n\nIn Germany, the U.S. Embassy spokesman told Kakissis that the circumstances raise questions about the confidentiality of sensitive communications, implying that information carried over Huawei's equipment could be at risk of being piped to Chinese intelligence agencies.\n\nLast week, Huawei sued the U.S. government for banning federal agencies from purchasing Huawei equipment \u2014 a restriction in the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act.\n\nThe tech company says the ban violates the Constitution's Bill of Attainder clause \u2014 which, as NPR's Matthew Schwartz reported, \"prohibits Congress from singling out a company or individual for punishment without a trial.\"\n\nThe U.S. clash with Huawei includes a deep disagreement over the arrest in Canada and possible extradition of Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou, who is also the founder's daughter. Meng appeared in a Canadian court last week; an extradition hearing is set for May 8 \u2014 a date that falls within U.S.-China trade talks to resolve ongoing trade disputes.\n\nAs scrutiny of Huawei has grown, Australia and New Zealand have joined the U.S. in barring the company from their 5G networks. Italy and Japan are reportedly considering the same move. And other countries have issued security warnings about Huawei and China, including the Czech Republic and Lithuania.\n\nIn January, Poland's Internal Security Agency arrested a Huawei executive on suspicion of spying for China, in a case that centers on the telecom company Orange Polska.",

    "title": "Huawei Sues the US, Prodding It to Prove Suspicions",
    "description": "The lawsuit by Huawei faces long odds but could force the US to show any evidence around backdoors and spying.",
    "text": "The world's largest telecommunications-equipment company, China's Huawei, is suing the US government. But the suit isn't just about US law. It's part of Huawei's larger campaign to defend its role as a global provider of telecom gear amid fears that its technology is or could be used by the Chinese government for spying. In essence, Huawei is challenging the US government to prove its suspicions.\n\nLast year President Donald Trump signed a defense spending bill that banned government agencies from buying gear from Huawei and fellow Chinese telecom giant ZTE, and from doing business with companies that use the two companies' technology. Government pressure had already effectively barred China from the US market over concerns that it could build backdoors into its products or hand over information about security bugs that China could use to attack US telecom networks. The US also has been pressuring its allies around the world to stop doing business with the company. Australia, for example, has effectively banned carriers from using Huawei's gear to build 5G networks, and other countries, including Japan, have also cracked down on the company.\n\nIn a press conference in January, Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei said the company has not and would not spy for the Chinese government. \"I support the Communist Party of China, but I will never do anything to harm any other nation,\" he said, according to The Wall Street Journal.\n\nHuawei filed suit against the US on Wednesday arguing that last year's defense bill unfairly bans only Huawei and ZTE, while other companies that manufacture their equipment in China are not. It also alleges that the ban violates the US Constitution's separation of powers and violates the company's rights of due process.\n\n\"They have a shot, but it's a longshot,\u201d says Julian Ku, a professor of law at Hofstra University. \"It's a very tough row to hoe to overcome Congress' management of who can get federal contracts.\"\n\nBut Huawei might not have to win the suit to benefit. The lawsuit is a way for it to push back against one of the core accusations against it. It's a chance for the company to defend its reputation in court and to challenge the US government to provide evidence of its suspicions.\n\n\"I think it's a PR move for them,\" says mobile industry analyst Chetan Sharma. \"It's about signaling to other countries that might be on the fence about doing business with Huawei that Huawei is a safe partner.\"\n\nLEARN MORE The WIRED Guide to 5G\n\nThe company's reputation has taken a beating over the past year. CFO Meng Wanzhou, Ren's daughter, was arrested in Canada over US allegations that the company violated US sanctions against Iran. The US Department of Justice announced charges against Meng and the company in January, and also indicted the company for stealing intellectual property from T-Mobile. A Huawei employee was also arrested in Poland on espionage charges.\n\nHuawei has long had to contend with accusations that it could be used by China for espionage or sabotage, says Kevin Allison of the political risk-consulting firm Eurasia Group. \"But those concerns have started to morph in recent weeks,\" he says. \"The US government is now saying 'They steal intellectual property and flaunt US law.'\"\n\nAllison sees the lawsuit against the US government as part of a broader push by the company to present a counter-narrative. At Mobile World Congress in Barcelona last month, Huawei Chair Guo Ping talked up information leaked by Edward Snowden that the National Security Agency had planted its own backdoors in equipment from Huawei as well as Western companies like Cisco. Huawei also commissioned legal reviews by the law firms Zhong Lun in Beijing and Clifford Chance in London that concluded the Chinese government can\u2019t force Huawei to help it conduct cyberattacks. And Meng filed suit this month in Canada alleging that her arrest violated her rights.\n\n\"It's about signaling to other countries that might be on the fence about doing business with Huawei that Huawei is a safe partner.\" Chetan Sharma, telecom analyst\n\nIt hasn't been all bad news for Huawei. The head of the UK\u2019s intelligence agency signaled last month the agency wouldn\u2019t ban Huawei outright. Likewise, a German government spokesperson told CNBC that the country wasn't ready to ban Huawei. On Thursday the German government announced new security requirements for mobile networks that apply to all vendors, not just Huawei or Chinese companies. Sharma says losing access to Germany would have been a major blow to Huawei.\n\nEven if Huawei's suit is more about perception than gaining access to the US market, it's possible that the company could win in court. Ku says that Huawei's due process claim is its weakest. \"Due process is for fundamental rights, and you don't have a fundamental right to do business with the federal government,\" he says. Likewise, the separation of powers claim is on shaky ground. Where Huawei has the best chance of winning is its claim that the law impermissibly singled out the company.\n\nLast year a federal judge dismissed a similar suit filed by Russian information-security company Kaspersky Lab after it was banned from government contracts. Ku says Huawei will argue that this case is different because the US government isn't just banning government agencies from doing business with Huawei, but also blocking agencies from doing business with users of the company's gear.\n\n\"It's a novel enough issue that it will go to appeal,\" Ku says. \"There will be quite a bit of litigation.\u201d\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories",

    "description": "The U.S. campaign against China's Huawei is having little impact on the company's sales and it is unlikely many countries will follow the United States in banning Huawei from building next-generation mobile networks, its rotating Chairman Eric Xu said.",
    "text": "(In March 26 story, modifies paragraph 13 to show that Reuters could not independently verify Huawei\u2019s ownership structure; corrects paragraph 20 to show that Huawei is the No. 3 vendor of smartphones)\n\nFILE PHOTO: Eric Xu, CEO of Huawei, addresses media at Cebit, the world's biggest computer and software fair, in Hanover, Germany, March 14, 2016. REUTERS/Nigel Treblin\n\nBy Jonathan Weber and Sijia Jiang\n\nSHENZHEN/HONG KONG (Reuters) - The U.S. campaign against China\u2019s Huawei is having little impact on the company\u2019s sales and it is unlikely many countries will follow the United States in banning Huawei from building next-generation mobile networks, its rotating Chairman Eric Xu said.\n\n\u201cRecently we are seeing a large number of countries making their own decisions,\u201d Xu said during an interview at Huawei Technologies\u2019 headquarters in Shenzhen.\n\nWhile Australia has banned Huawei from 5G networks over security concerns, European Union countries such as Germany and France have indicated they are likely to ignore the U.S. call to shut out the telecoms giant.\n\n\u201cMaybe it\u2019s only Australia,\u201d Xu told Reuters reporters after a tour of the campus.\n\nXu affirmed that Huawei\u2019s revenue jumped 36 percent over the first two months of 2019 and was set for a 15 percent annual spike to $125 billion, underlining strength in its smartphone business and sales of computing and communications networks.\n\nHuawei has been facing mounting scrutiny, led by the United States, amid worries its equipment could be used by Beijing for spying. The company, however, says the concerns are unfounded.\n\nXu said he does not expect the United States to intensify its attack on the company by barring sales of U.S. components to Huawei, a move that almost put its compatriot ZTE Corp out of business last year before U.S. President Donald Trump lifted the ban.\n\nHuawei is the world\u2019s third-largest buyer of computer chips, many of which come from U.S. companies, and a sales ban would be disruptive to the global tech industry, Xu said.\n\nXu\u2019s comments come at a time when Huawei has sued the U.S. government over a law that restricts its market access.\n\nIn Canada, lawyers for Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of founder Ren Zhengfei, have sued the government over her Dec. 1 arrest at the behest of the United States. She was charged with bank and wire fraud to violate U.S. sanctions against Iran.\n\nCAMPUS TOUR\n\nHuawei, a privately held firm that offers few details about its internal operations, has in recent months offered media interviews and invited journalists to tour its facilities as part of a counter-attack against the allegations of spying.\n\nReuters reporters were invited on Monday to peruse files in Huawei\u2019s \u201cshare registry room\u201d where it keeps records on tens of thousands of employee shareholders.\n\nHuawei said the records show that the firm is owned by its employees and that its 74-year-old founder Ren owns just over 1 percent of the company. Reuters could not independently verify the ownership structure.\n\nMuch of the global scrutiny of Huawei stems from Ren\u2019s background with China\u2019s People\u2019s Liberation Army, where he was a civilian engineer for nearly a decade until his departure in 1983 after helping to build its communications network.\n\nReuters also toured Huawei\u2019s new campus in Dongguan, near Shenzhen, that features buildings modeled on European cities including Paris and Heidelberg, connected by a special train imported from Switzerland.\n\nHowever, there was little activity on the campus, which is designed to house 18,000 workers, save a couple of black swans flitting about a lake.\n\nIn contrast, another Huawei facility nearby bustled with workers assembling smartphones on automated production lines.\n\nNEW GROWTH DRIVERS\n\nHuawei\u2019s growth is mainly being driven by its booming smartphone business and sales of computing and communications networks to government and business customers.\n\nFuture growth will also come \u201cprimarily\u201d from these, Xu said, with sales of equipment to telecom carriers growing at single digit rates.\n\nHuawei is the world\u2019s top producer of telecoms equipment and third-biggest maker of smartphones.\n\nOn Huawei\u2019s semiconductor operations, HiSilicon, Xu said the unit produced more than $7.5 billion worth of chips last year. That compares with an estimated $21 billon of chips that Huawei acquired from outside vendors.\n\nHiSilicon produces chip designs for Huawei\u2019s equipment mainly, with the manufacturing handled by so-called \u201cfoundry\u201d companies such as Taiwan\u2019s TSMC.\n\nSlideshow (20 Images)\n\nIt does sell chips to others for use in video cameras, television set-top boxes and some low-cost internet-connected devices, Xu said.\n\nHuawei will report its 2018 financial results at a press briefing on Friday, which over a hundred journalists are expected to attend, far more than in past years.\n\n\u201cThe United States should take quite a lot of the credit for making advertisements for Huawei,\u201d Xu quipped.",

    "description": "The surprise arrest of Huawei's chief financial officer in December quickly turned the executive, Meng Wanzhou, into a central figure in a trade war between two economic superpowers.",
    "text": "(Reuters) - The surprise arrest of Huawei\u2019s chief financial officer in December quickly turned the executive, Meng Wanzhou, into a central figure in a trade war between two economic superpowers.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A researcher works at a laboratory inside the headquarters of the Chinese telecommunications equipment and smartphone maker Huawei in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China March 6, 2019. REUTERS/Yuyang Wang\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump told Reuters he would consider intervening in her case - a potential action he alluded to again two weeks ago - if it would help close a trade deal with China.\n\nMeng\u2019s lawyer on Wednesday told a Canadian court that he has concerns the allegations against her have a political character, noting Trump\u2019s comments on the case.\n\nBut U.S. probes of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd for allegedly evading U.S. sanctions on Iran were not rooted in Trump\u2019s trade aspirations. Long before Trump initiated a bitter trade war with China, Huawei activities were under scrutiny by U.S. authorities, according to interviews with ten people familiar with the Huawei probes and documents related to the investigations seen by Reuters.\n\nThe U.S. focus on Huawei intensified after years of investigation into smaller Chinese rival ZTE Corp, and relied in part on information collected from devices of company employees traveling through airports.\n\nTwo of the sources said a critical point took place in August 2017, when deputy U.S. Attorney General Rod Rosenstein - best known for his oversight of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe of Russian interference in the U.S. election \u2013 handed a lead role to Brooklyn prosecutors to pursue possible bank fraud charges against Huawei.\n\nFifteen months later, that strategy would help land Meng in a Canadian jail.\n\nThe U.S. investigations of China\u2019s top telecom companies were spurred by reports by Reuters over six years ago, detailing possible Iran sanctions violations by both ZTE and Huawei, as well as close ties between Huawei and Skycom Tech Co Ltd - a suspected front company doing business in Iran.\n\nA spokesman for Huawei, the world\u2019s largest telecommunications equipment maker, has denied the charges in the sanctions case, and did not provide further comment to Reuters. Meng has said she is innocent of the charges. ZTE, which pleaded guilty in 2017 for illegally shipping U.S. goods to Iran, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nU.S. Justice Department spokeswoman Nicole Navas Oxman said the government pursues cases \u201cfree of any political interference and follows the evidence and rule of law in pursuing criminal charges.\u201d\n\nAIRPORT EVIDENCE GRAB\n\nOn December 1, 2018, Meng was stopped at Vancouver International Airport as she walked up the jetway after her flight, according to a lawsuit she filed on Friday accusing the Canadian government of violating her rights. Border officers examined her passport and escorted her to an area for secondary screenings.\n\nWhile there, she was instructed to surrender her two mobile phones, an iPad and a personal computer, along with their passwords, the suit alleges, and the officers viewed the devices\u2019 contents.\n\nReuters has not been able to determine what information was found on Meng\u2019s devices, but it is not the first time she and other Chinese telecom executives have turned over such property to border patrol agents.\n\nIn the years leading up to the Huawei indictment, U.S. officials had been capturing information that would influence the investigation when telecom executives passed through U.S. airports, according to a number of sources familiar with the Huawei and ZTE investigations and the Meng indictment.\n\nFor example, Meng arrived in the United States via John F. Kennedy International Airport in early 2014. The indictment says investigators found \u201csuggested talking points\u201d on one of her electronic devices, stating among other things that Huawei\u2019s relationship with Skycom was \u201cnormal business cooperation.\u201d\n\nMeng had been pulled into a secondary screening at the airport that time as well, and her electronic devices were taken, according to one person familiar with the stop. After a couple of hours, the devices were returned and she was freed to go, the person said.\n\nAnother border search, this time on September 12, 2014, of executives from rival ZTE also supported U.S. investigators long-held suspicions of how Huawei might have been doing illicit business in countries subject to U.S. sanctions, one of the sources told Reuters.\n\nZTE\u2019s CFO at the time was stopped at Boston\u2019s Logan Airport after flying in from London with an assistant, the person said.\n\nThe assistant was carrying a Lenovo laptop containing a confidential ZTE document, dated August 25, 2011 and signed by four top executives, about the need to establish front companies to supply U.S. procured items needed for projects in embargoed countries.\n\nThe airport stop provided key evidence against ZTE in its legal battle with the United States, according to U.S. officials. But it also identified a company as \u201cF7\u201d and how it used a front company to serve as its agent for contracts in sanctioned countries. F7 was Huawei, according to the individuals familiar with the ZTE and Huawei investigations.\n\nThe document was posted on the U.S. Commerce Department website in March 2016 when ZTE was placed on a list of companies that were restricted from buying parts and components from U.S. suppliers. Shortly after the public posting, the New York Times reported that the description of F7 offered by ZTE matched Huawei.\n\nA month later, the Commerce Department sent a subpoena to Huawei in the United States demanding information on the company\u2019s exporting American technology to Iran, according to a court document and one of the people familiar with the Huawei probe.\n\nFROM ZTE TO HUAWEI\n\nWith the case against ZTE wrapping up, more than a dozen people from Departments of Treasury, Commerce, Homeland Security and Justice, gathered in Washington on February 14, 2017 and talked about how they were moving forward against Huawei, according to a person familiar with matter.\n\nBrooklyn prosecutors discussed the relationship between Huawei and HSBC, a bank that was required to cooperate with U.S. prosecutors in any investigation until the end of 2017 for violating U.S. anti-money laundering and sanctions laws, the person added.\n\nIn late 2016, HSBC began to conduct an internal bank probe of Huawei. In the weeks and months following the meeting, HSBC helped authorities obtain evidence of links between Skycom and Huawei, documents reviewed by Reuters show. The probe found Meng met in 2013 with a HSBC banker. She later gave him a copy of the PowerPoint presentation, which the U.S. indictment says misrepresented Huawei\u2019s control of Skycom.\n\nHSBC told Reuters that it provided information in response to demands from the Justice Department.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in Washington, D.C., meanwhile, pursued a more traditional export control investigation against Huawei, which included the accusations of attempted illegal shipments of computers to Iran disclosed in the Reuters 2012 story.\n\nA grand jury subpoena was issued to the U.S subsidiary of the company in April 2017, the first clear sign to Huawei that the probe had turned criminal.\n\nArmed with that knowledge, the company moved U.S.-based Chinese employees who knew about its Iranian dealings out of the country and otherwise concealed and destroyed evidence, the prosecutors allege. Meng and other Huawei executives also began to avoid travel to the United States, prosecutors say.\n\nIn the late summer of 2017, according to two of the sources close to the Huawei investigation, Rosenstein chose Brooklyn as the venue to file charges and the Washington U.S. Attorney\u2019s office dropped out of the case. Brooklyn was already working with a money laundering unit at the Justice Department. The national security division also merged with the Brooklyn prosecution team.\n\nLegal experts said since most evidence of any illegal U.S. goods in Iran presumably existed outside the jurisdiction of U.S. authorities, the bank fraud route presented a potentially quicker path to indictment. They added that bank fraud charges are more likely to lead to arrest by other countries for extradition to the United States than export controls or sanctions violations, and have a longer statute of limitations.\n\nMeng and the company were charged with bank and wire fraud. The PowerPoint presentation\u2019s \u201cnumerous misrepresentations\u201d were central to the charges brought against Meng herself, the indictment shows.\n\nTwelve months after Brooklyn got the case, prosecutors secretly obtained a warrant for Meng\u2019s arrest.\n\nLess than four months later they learned she was stopping in Vancouver en route to Mexico on December 1, and asked the Canadians to detain her at the airport.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Huawei partner offered embargoed HP gear to Iran - reut.rs/2sRL7Ve\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Huawei CFO linked to firm that offered HP gear to Iran - reut.rs/2sUq8RT\n\nEXCLUSIVE: China's ZTE planned U.S. computer sale to Iran - reut.rs/2T17JlN\n\nChinese firm (ZTE) helps Iran spy on citizens - reut.rs/2TlJJJq",

Guo said the ban would limit competition, slowing the rollout of fifth-generation communications and raising consumer prices.\n\nHuawei has about 40 percent of the global market for network gear but its U.S. sales evaporated after a congressional panel in 2012 cited the company and a Chinese competitor, ZTE Corp., as security risks and told phone carriers to avoid dealing with them.\n\nU.S. authorities \"have hacked our servers and stolen our emails\" but have presented no evidence to support their security claims, Guo said. He complaining Washington was \"sparing no effort to smear\" the company.\n\nWashington's campaign to persuade allies to shun Huawei threatens to block access to major markets as phone carriers prepare to invest billions of dollars in fifth-generation equipment.\n\nCHINA BLASTS US OVER INDICTMENTS, 'UNREASONABLE CRACKDOWN' ON HUAWEI\n\nHuawei says the new law would shrink its potential U.S. market further by prohibiting the government from buying the Chinese vendor's technology and from buying goods or services from or giving grants or loans to companies or other third parties that do. The United States accounts for 20 to 25 percent of the global market for computer and telecom technology.\n\nThe company is challenging the U.S. law as an unconstitutional \"bill of attainder,\" or a measure that targets a specific individual for penalties without a trial. The company says that infringes its due process rights and improperly has Congress play the role of a court.\n\nThe ban is \"based on numerous false, unproven and untested propositions,\" said Song Liuping, the company's chief legal officer, at the news conference. \"Huawei has an excellent security record and program.No contrary evidence has been offered.\"\n\nThe Chinese government has accused Washington of fabricating or exaggerating security concerns to block a successful Chinese competitor.\n\nHuawei, based in Shenzhen, near Hong Kong, is a leading developer of 5G along with rivals Nokia Corp. of Finland and Sweden's LM Ericsson. Industry analysts say excluding the Chinese vendor from markets for 5G equipment would reduce competition and might lead to higher prices.\n\nHuawei, founded in 1987 by a former military engineer, overtook Ericsson in 2017 as the biggest global supplier of network gear. It says it supplies 45 of the world's top 50 phone companies and has contracts with 30 carriers to test 5G wireless technology.\n\nEuropean governments are balking at U.S. pressure to ban Huawei. The company has announced contracts with customers including the United Arab Emirates in the Middle East for network technology.\n\nCHINA ACCUSES US OF 'DOUBLE STANDARD' OVER HUAWEI CLAIMS\n\nIn January, U.S. prosecutors filed charges accusing Huawei of stealing trade secrets and its chief financial officer of lying to banks about dealings with Iran.\n\nThe executive, who is the daughter of the company's founder, was arrested Dec. 1 by Canadian authorities and is fighting a U.S. extradition request.\n\nChina's government arrested two Canadians, a former diplomat and a businessman, on Dec. 10 in what was widely seen as an attempt to pressure Canada to release the executive, Meng Wanzhou.\n\nOn Monday, the government accused the two men of acting together to steal state secrets. That followed the Canadian government's announcement Friday that the extradition proceeding would be allowed to continue.\n\nHuawei executives deny wrongdoing and say American security warnings have yet to affect sales outside the United States. The company's 2018 revenue forecast is $100 billion and its founder, Ren Zhengfei, said last month this year's target is $125 billion.\n\nSome European officials and others cite a Chinese security law that requires companies to cooperate with intelligence agencies. They say Huawei and other tech companies might be required to install \"backdoors\" in equipment to allow eavesdropping.\n\nHuawei denies altering its equipment to facilitate spying and has set up testing centers in Britain, Canada and continental Europe to allow governments to examine its technology.\n\nCHINA'S HUAWEI SPY RISKS THREATEN U.S. DIPLOMACY ABROAD\n\n\"Huawei has not and will never implant `backdoors,' \" said Guo, the chairman.\n\nThe company also has launched a public relations campaign abroad.\n\nIts typically press-shy founder, Ren, gave a two-hour interview to foreign reporters in January in which he said Huawei would reject Chinese government demands to disclose confidential information about its customers. Since then, Ren also has talked at length with foreign TV broadcasters.",

Picture taken January 13, 2014. REUTERS/Kim Kyung-Hoon\n\nBusinessman Spavor, who worked with North Korea, and former diplomat Kovrig were picked up in December, shortly after Canada arrested Huawei Technologies Co Ltd Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou, who faces extradition to the United States.\n\nChina has repeatedly demanded Meng be released, and reacted angrily last week when Ottawa approved extradition proceedings against her.\n\nThe Communist Party\u2019s Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission said Kovrig had often entered China using an ordinary passport and business visas, \u201cstealing and spying on sensitive Chinese information and intelligence via a contact in China\u201d.\n\n\u201cSpavor was Kovrig\u2019s main contact and provided him with intelligence,\u201d the commission added, without giving details.\n\nKovrig - who works for the International Crisis Group (ICG) non-governmental organisation - severely violated Chinese laws, and China will start the next judicial proceedings in due course, it said.\n\n\u201cChina is a country with rule of law and will firmly crack down on criminal acts that severely undermine national security.\u201d\n\nCanada\u2019s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The ICG, which focuses on conflict resolution and has denied any involvement in espionage, said it had heard nothing official about any charges.\n\n\u201cMichael\u2019s work for Crisis Group has been entirely transparent and in the open,\u201d spokesman Karim Lebhour said. \u201cVague and unsubstantiated accusations against him are unwarranted and unfair.\u201d\n\nWhile Canada says China has made no specific link between the detentions and Meng\u2019s arrest, experts and former diplomats say they have no doubt it is using the cases of the two men to pressure Canada.\n\nCanadian diplomats have visited the two men. However, sources familiar with the case have said Kovrig has not been allowed access to lawyers or family members, unlike Huawei\u2019s Meng.\n\nDavid Mulroney, a former Canadian ambassador to China, said the detainees would come under increased pressure to talk about people they had met.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be told that if they confess to something they may be able to expect a degree of leniency,\u201d he told the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. \u201cThey\u2019ll also probably be asked to see if they can put pressure on Canadian officials who visit them to see if they can secure the release of Ms Meng.\u201d\n\nChina has said it is fully guaranteeing both men\u2019s lawful rights. Kovrig also holds Hungarian citizenship.\n\nA man holds a sign calling for China to release Wang Bingzhang and former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig, who was arrested in China on Tuesday, at the B.C.

In late January the U.S. Justice Department charged Meng and Huawei with conspiring to violate U.S. sanctions on Iran.\n\nShe is free on bail and denies the charges against her.\n\nSeparately, Huawei plans to announce a lawsuit against the U.S. government on Thursday on grounds related to a defence bill, a source with knowledge of the matter said.",

The news was spotted earlier Thursday by the South China Morning Post.\n\n\"We have prepared our own operating system. Should it ever happen that we can no longer use these systems, we would be prepared. That's our plan B,\" said Richard Yu, mobile chief of Huawei Technologies, according to a translation of the Die Welt interview. \"But of course we prefer to work with the ecosystems of Google and Microsoft.\"\n\nHuawei didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThis comes as tensions between Huawei and the US government have escalated in recent months.

International tensions were heightened in December with the arrest of CFO Meng Wanzhou over alleged violations of Iran sanctions. Canada on Friday granted the US' request to extradite Meng.\n\nUS Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in February that the US won't partner with countries that use Huawei's technology because they'd pose security threats.\n\nLast week, Huawei fired back with a lawsuit against the US government over a ban on its telecom equipment. The suit was filed in the US District Court in the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that Congress had failed to present \"any evidence\" for its ban on Huawei products and equipment and was thus \"unconstitutional.\"",
