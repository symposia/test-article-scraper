    "description": "Huawei says Chinese law prohibits the government from ordering it to install backdoors for spying. US lawyers say a law's text isn't always the final word in China.",
    "text": "Over the past year, telecoms manufacturer Huawei has become a pariah outside its native China.\n\nThe company grew rapidly in recent years as its low-cost telecom equipment and smartphones won favor with telcos and consumers. It is the world\u2019s largest maker of telecom gear, and a leading vendor of the technology needed to build next-generation 5G mobile networks.\n\nBut the Federal Communications Commission warned last year that use of Huawei\u2019s equipment in US telecom networks might weaken US national security due to the company\u2019s close ties to China\u2019s government, which has been implicated in hacking campaigns against US companies and government agencies. President Trump later signed a bill banning US government purchases of Huawei equipment. And the company faces similar accusations or bans in Australia, Germany, Poland, and the UK, as well as US indictments alleging the company breached sanctions on Iran and stole secrets from T-Mobile. (On Friday, Canada said it would allow an extradition hearing against Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou, who is accused in relation to the Iran case, to proceed.)\n\nIn its defense, Huawei argues that, under Chinese law, it can\u2019t be ordered to help with government hacking campaigns. But US experts on Chinese law and tech policy say the country\u2019s government doesn\u2019t limit itself to what the law explicitly allows.\n\nHuawei\u2019s CEO and founder Ren Zhengfei told journalists in January that \u201cno law in China requires any company to install mandatory backdoors,\u201d secret flaws that would allow spying or cyberattacks. In an opinion article published Monday in WIRED, Zhou Hanhua, a top legal scholar at the Chinese Academy of Social Science\u2019s law institute, agreed with Ren\u2019s assertion. \u201cNo Chinese laws compel the installation of backdoors or other spyware,\u201d Zhou wrote.\n\nThe Chinese Academy of Social Science functions as a kind of state-supported think tank, and Zhou is a respected legal thinker inside and outside of China. He has helped the country\u2019s government develop its first freedom of information laws, and also drafted privacy legislation.\n\nAll the same, scholars of Chinese law and tech policy outside the country are dismissive of Zhou\u2019s arguments in Huawei\u2019s defense.\n\nDonald Clarke, a professor and specialist in Chinese law at George Washington University, says it\u2019s possible that the letter of the Chinese law does protect the company, although it would take a careful analysis to check. But he says that it\u2019s practically irrelevant given how China\u2019s one-party government operates.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a whole variety of pressures that the government can bring to bear on a company or individual, and they are not at all limited to criminal prosecution,\u201d Clarke says. \u201cChina is a Leninist state that does not recognize any limits to government power.\u201d\n\nGraham Webster, who works on Chinese digital policy at think tank New America, agrees. \u201cThe law has real effect in China, but in circumstances like national security it isn\u2019t decisive,\u201d he says.\n\nZhou\u2019s op-ed cites legal analyses by two major law firms, Beijing\u2019s Zhong Lun and London\u2019s Clifford Chance. He says the Chinese firm determined that China\u2019s Intelligence Law doesn\u2019t permit the government to compel telecom equipment firms to help with cyberattacks. Clifford Chance reviewed that report and concluded it was sound, Zhou says. A Clifford Chance spokesperson confirmed that the firm reviewed and supports Zhong Lun\u2019s conclusions. Zhong Lun did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLEARN MORE The WIRED Guide to 5G\n\nBoth law-firm reports were commissioned by Huawei; only the Zhong Lun document is public, in a filing to the Federal Communications Commission last year. The company has cited them in a letter to the UK\u2019s parliament and, as highlighted by Czech research project Sinopsis, to defend itself in Australia and Poland.\n\nAndy Purdy, chief security officer for Huawei in the US, says the company will look into making the law firms\u2019 analyses public. He also argues that Huawei is being unfairly singled out over risks that exist for all telecom equipment providers.\n\nChina\u2014or another country with good hacking skills\u2014could target the supply chain of any of Huawei\u2019s rivals, Purdy says. The company\u2019s two closest competitors, Nokia and Ericsson, both work with Chinese manufacturing companies.\n\nSimha Sethumadavan, a professor at Columbia University who researches hardware and supply chain security, agrees that backdoors are a concern for computing technology no matter its origin. Documents in the trove leaked by Edward Snowden underline the point. They indicated that the National Security Agency created backdoors into networking equipment from many major networking companies\u2014including Huawei and US company Cisco.\n\n\u201cIt is possible for parts manufactured entirely in the United States or in trusted foundries to end up having untrustworthy modifications,\u201d Sethumadavan says. He adds, however, that it can be harder to detect or defend against backdoors inserted by a company cooperating with an operation, as critics say Huawei might be forced to do.\n\nThe head of UK foreign intelligence service MI6 recently suggested that, rather than ban Huawei from telecom networks, it may be better to manage the risks of using its equipment, in the interest of maintaining a diversity of suppliers. \u201cIt\u2019s more complicated than in or out,\u201d Alex Younger told reporters at the Munich Security Conference.\n\nHuawei\u2019s Purdy says he hopes to persuade the US to take a similar view and devise processes to vet the company and its equipment, similar to how acquisitions and mergers involving overseas companies get national security scrutiny.\n\nUpdated, 3-6-19, 12:30pm ET: This story has been updated to reflect that the Zhong Lun analysis had been made public in a filing to the FCC last year.\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories",

Word is that the consumer electronics giant is planning to unveil a lawsuit against the U.S. government later this week.\n\nThat news comes via two anonymous sources reported in The New York Times this morning. The reported impending suit is pushback against longstanding bans in the States that have barred the company\u2019s equipment from infrastructural projects ahead of a nationwide push into 5G. It\u2019s also made the nation\u2019s carriers and retail stores wary of stocking Huawei products.\n\nThe suit is reportedly set to be filed in the Eastern District of Texas \u2014 the location of Huawei\u2019s U.S. headquarters, as well as a notorious haven for patent trolls.\n\nU.S. officials have long recommended against using Huawei devices over alleged ties to the Chinese government.

    "text": "Huawei has decided to go on the legal offence against the United States government after defending itself against alleged espionage and bank frauds linked to American sanctions on Iran. During a press conference late Wednesday, Huawei announced that it has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government, arguing that a ban on the use of its products by federal agencies and contractors violated due process and is unconstitutional.\n\nThe company is the world\u2019s largest maker of telecommunications equipment and a growing threat to Apple in the global smartphone race. At the center of the suit, which is filed with a federal court in Huawei\u2019s U.S. home base Texas, is the company\u2019s claim that Section 889 in the National Defense Authorization Act, passed in August 2018, is unconstitutional.\n\nSection 889 contains restrictions that prevent federal agencies from procuring Huawei equipment or services, working with contractors that use Huawei equipment or services or awarding grants and loans that would be used to procure Huawei products.\n\nDuring today\u2019s press conference, Huawei\u2018s rotating chairman Guo Ping said Congress has failed to provide evidence to support the restrictions or allowed Huawei due process of law. The company is seeking a permanent injunction against the restrictions.\n\n\u201cFor three decades, we have maintained a solid track record in security,\u201d said Guo. \u201cHuawei has not and never installed backdoors and we will never allow others to install backdoors in our equipment. The U.S. government branded our services a threat. The U.S. government has never provided any evidence supporting their accusations that Huawei poses a serious security threat. The U.S. government is sparing no effort to smear the company. Even worse, it is trying to block us in other countries.\u201d\n\nU.S. officials have long warned domestic companies and other governments against using Huawei equipment over threats that China could be using its tech for spying. A law passed in 2017 requires all organizations and citizens to \u201csupport, assist, and cooperate with national intelligence efforts in accordance with law, and shall protect national intelligence work secrets they are aware of.\u201d\n\nHuawei\u2019s legal action compares with a reconciliation reached between its rival ZTE and the U.S. government last year. The U.S. announced in July that it would lift a ban preventing ZTE from selling to American suppliers after ZTE agreed to pay a $1 billion fine. The penalty followed an investigation showing that the Chinese maker of telecommunications devices had violated U.S. sanctions by doing business with Iran and North Korea.\n\nGrowing threats\n\nConcerns around Huawei have escalated as the Chinese company grows to play a key role in 5G, the network solution crucial to driverless cars, remote surgeries and other futuristic technologies. In the backdrop is China\u2019s ambition to lead the global 5G evolution, which has seen Beijing fast-track the issuance of 5G commercial licenses to spur consumer interests.\n\nEarlier this year, the U.S. Justice Department filed criminal charges against Huawei and its financial executive Meng Wanzhou over business practices that allegedly circumvent U.S. sanctions over Iran. Meng announced this week she is suing the Canadian government and police for violating her rights when they detained her on behalf of the U.S. government in December.\n\nHuawei executives, including founder Ren Zhengfei who rarely speaks out publicly, have firmly denied the presence of any backdoors in its equipment. Ren recently declared that the U.S. won\u2019t hamper his company\u2019s trajectory and that the arrest of Meng \u2014 his daughter \u2014 is a \u201cpolitically motivated act [that] is not acceptable.\u201d\n\nThe Huawei controversy comes as the U.S. and China are engaged in a prolonged trade dispute. Critics have warned that escalating tensions between the world\u2019s largest economies could strangle innovation breakthroughs, as countries around the world become increasingly reliant on China for investment, supply chain resources and skilled labor while many of them depend on the U.S. for security alliance.\n\nUpdate (March 7, 2019, 11:30 am): Added context on ZTE and trade war.",

    "text": "Photo: Getty\n\nHuawei\u2019s ongoing battle with the U.S. government suffered a significant blow on Friday when Canadian authorities ruled that an extradition hearing for the Chinese company\u2019s CFO, Meng Wanzhou, can move forward. The decision capped a week in which Huawei has experienced a series of victories and defeats in its struggle to fend off accusations that it represents a security threat to the world.\n\nMeng is the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, so her case is also deeply personal for the company. In December, she was arrested in Vancouver, and the U.S. Department of Justice is seeking her extradition to face fraud charges over alleged violations of American sanctions. According to Bloomberg, Canada\u2019s Department of Justice announced this afternoon that it is satisfied that an extradition hearing can proceed. A statement from the agency reads in part:\n\nThe decision follows a thorough and diligent review of the evidence in this case. The Department is satisfied that the requirements set out by the Extradition Act for the issuance of an Authority to Proceed have been met and there is sufficient evidence to be put before an extradition judge for decision.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe hearing over Meng\u2019s extradition is scheduled to begin on March 6 and is expected to have political resonance far beyond the courtroom. But the case is just one facet of the Trump administration\u2019s war on Huawei. The U.S. intelligence community has had serious concerns about the telecommunications manufacturer for years. A trade war with China and the deployment of 5G infrastructure around the world has placed Huawei firmly in the crosshairs of an administration that fears Chinese dominance in the tech sector and the potential for its intelligence services to install backdoors into networking equipment.\n\nThe DOJ is also charging Huawei with stealing trade secrets from T-Mobile. On Thursday, representatives for two divisions of the company pleaded not guilty in a federal court in Seattle. The company is accused of stealing proprietary information about a highly sensitive robot arm that\u2019s used for testing smartphones.\n\nHuawei has repeatedly insisted that it does not aid Chinese spying efforts in any way whatsoever and that its relationship with the Chinese government is the same as any other company that operates in that country. Ahead of Canada\u2019s decision to go forward with Meng\u2019s extradition proceedings, Chinese ambassador to Canada Lu Shaye said the accusations by the U.S. are total \u201cbunk.\u201d He framed the situation as a political power play saying, \u201cThe attack by U.S. and other countries\u2019 intelligence agencies is not based on real national security concerns, but is meant to crowd out Huawei and create unfair competition conditions to benefit their own domestic telecom equipment companies.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe U.S. has been conducting a frenzied campaign to convince allies to refuse to use Huawei technology in their 5G networks. The new wireless standard is expected to be exponentially faster than the mobile internet speeds we have today and its considered to be a crucial factor in the deployment of upcoming data-hungry technologies like autonomous vehicles. Amid the product announcements and presentations at the Mobile World Congress trade show in Barcelona this week, a delegation sent by the Trump administration was lobbying countries to avoid Huawei equipment.\n\nBut it hasn\u2019t all been bad news for Huawei this week. If it were just an average company showing off new tech at MWC, it would probably be riding high right now. They arguably stole the show with the new Mate X bendable phone. And unlike Samsung, they weren\u2019t afraid to let attendees get their hands on it.\n\nIn general, you could characterize Huawei\u2019s posture this week as aggressive. It\u2019s consumer CEO, Richard Yu, told Business Insider that he\u2019d killed plans for a phone with a design that was similar to Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Fold because it was heavy and \u201cbad.\u201d The company didn\u2019t focus too much on its political difficulties, but it did crack some jokes about the trustworthiness of the U.S. government after the spying revelations that were exposed by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden in 2013. It also took out full-page newspaper ads encouraging the media to come to its firm themselves and telling reporters they shouldn\u2019t believe everything they hear.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHuawei\u2019s efforts to convince the world that its equipment is safe appears to be having some success. On Wednesday, Reuters reported that Germany is close to making a deal with the company that would allow it to roll out 5G equipment in the countries networks, and similar progress has been made in Italy, New Zealand, and the UK.\n\nLast week, Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei mocked the U.S. for being paranoid and said the whole controversy has been great \u201cpromotion\u201d for his company. \u201c5G was not known by common people,\u201d he said in an interview with CBS. \u201cBut now, these great figures are all talking about 5G. \u2026 And we\u2019re becoming more influential and getting more contracts.\u201d\n\n[Bloomberg, New York Times]",

Meng has been charged with fraud and violating U.S. sanctions against Iran and faces extradition to the U.S.\n\nIn January, the U.S. Justice Department charged Huawei Technologies with fraud, obstruction of justice, and the theft of trade secrets from T-Mobile. A new report from the New York Times this morning claims that Huawei plans to sue the U.S. government as soon as this week for blocking the use of the company\u2019s tech by federal agencies.\n\nSpavor runs an organization called Paektu Cultural Exchange which works to encourage both outside investment and western tourism in North Korea. Spavor is considered friendly with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, which makes the charges against Spavor even more strange. North Korea is a close ally of the Chinese government.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKovrig is a former diplomat to China and an advisor to a Brussels-based think tank called the International Crisis Group. The group\u2019s website includes a clock that lists how long Kovrig has been detained and calls for his immediate release.

Vague and unsubstantiated accusations against him are unwarranted and unfair.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe tit-for-tat arrests between the U.S., China, and Canada are all being done against the backdrop of the New Cold War. Western countries charge that Huawei shouldn\u2019t be developing 5G networks because of the tech giant\u2019s close ties to the Chinese government. But Huawei is pushing back by insisting that not only is Huawei safe, the United States engages in spying on its own citizens as well.\n\nThis issue isn\u2019t going away anytime soon. And in the meantime, any Americans or Canadians who are thinking about traveling to China in the near future may want to reconsider their plans. The last thing anyone wants is to become a pawn in this global chess game.\n\nAs we saw with President Donald Trump\u2019s recent comments on North Korea and Otto Warmbier, the U.S. government isn\u2019t necessarily going to go to bat for any Americans captured on the other side of what my colleague Andrew Liszewski recently called the Iron Firewall.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Washington Post]",

But Guo wasn\u2019t talking about Snow White. He was poking fun at the massive surveillance programs maintained by the United States.\n\n\n\nHuawei is under fire around the world as countries like the U.S., Canada, UK, New Zealand, and Australia question the technology company\u2019s close ties to the Chinese government and warn of potential spying by Beijing. The U.S. Justice Department even charged Huawei with fraud, obstruction of justice, and theft of trade secrets from T-Mobile during a strange press conference last month. But in his keynote speech in Barcelona, Guo made it clear that the company won\u2019t remain on the defensive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis was punctuated by Guo trolling the U.S. with comments about America\u2019s mass surveillance efforts, specifically a National Security Agency program whistleblower Edward Snowden revealed in 2013. Guo claimed that not only is Huawei deploying the most innovative technologies in the world, it operates secure environments for everyone. Guo further insisted during his 17-minute keynote address that the company \u201chas not and will never plant backdoors,\u201d which is quickly becoming a company line.\n\nMuch of the conflict surrounding Huawei centers around the deployment of its 5G network. The U.S. has expressed concern that a 5G infrastructure created using Huawei technology would give China\u2019s government sweeping abilities to surveil or otherwise control the world\u2019s next-generation communications network.\n\n\u201cThe irony is that the US CLOUD Act allows their governmental entities to access data across borders,\u201d Guo said. Upon delivering his \u201cPrism, prism on the wall, who\u2019s the most trustworthy of them all?\u201d line, a logo for the NSA\u2019s PRISM program appeared on a screen behind him. The otherwise subdued audience broke out into scattered applause.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an important question. And if you don\u2019t understand that, you can go ask Edward Snowden,\u201d Guo continued as there was laughter from the crowd. \u201cWe can\u2019t use prisms, crystal balls, or politics to manage cybersecurity. It\u2019s a challenge we all share.\u201d\n\nGuo echoed these comments in an op-ed published by the Financial Times this week in which he argues that \u201cthe more Huawei gear is installed in the world\u2019s telecommunications networks, the harder it becomes for the NSA to \u2018collect it all.\u2019\u201d\n\nBoth at MWC and in the Financial Times, Guo failed to mention China\u2019s own massive surveillance, censorship, and internment programs, of course.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can watch a clip from Guo\u2019s remarks for yourself on YouTube.\n\nSnowden revealed the NSA\u2019s PRISM program in June of 2013 as one of the American intelligence community\u2019s tools for spying on the entire world. Following his historic leak of classified NSA documents, Snowden fled to Russia and remains there in exile, though he has stated publicly that he would like to return to the U.S.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHuawei has been playing defense for some time, and high-placed executives like Huawei founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei have given rare interviews with American media this month to insist that the company isn\u2019t acting in the interests of the Chinese government.\n\nHuawei\u2019s CFO Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Vancouver on December 1, 2018, at the request of the U.S. government. Notably, Meng is the daughter of Huawei\u2019s CEO, Ren Zhengfei, and the Chinese government has said that the charges brought by the U.S. Justice Department are unfounded and politically motivated. President Donald Trump hasn\u2019t helped matters by implying that Meng could be released as part of his trade deal with China.\n\nThere\u2019s no end to the battle between Huawei and the West in sight. And as countries on the \u201cother\u201d side of the New Cold War (like Russia) further cut off their internet from the rest of the world\u2019s, we\u2019re likely to see a balkanization of the tech community that hasn\u2019t existed since the days of the Soviet Union.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe stereotype of the last Cold War was that the \u201cother\u201d side didn\u2019t have a sense of humor. But that seems to have changed dramatically as the New Cold War gets warmed up. Chinese companies can chant Snow White rhymes all day long. Just don\u2019t ask them about Winnie the Pooh.\n\n[Mobile World Live and Huawei Press Release]",

The details of Huawei\u2019s lawsuit are still unclear, but the Times claims that it will be an effort to force the U.S. \u201cto more publicly make its case\u201d that Huawei\u2019s technology is somehow a threat to the privacy and security of Americans. Gizmodo has reached out to Huawei for comment on the potential lawsuit but did not immediately hear back.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe U.S. and other Five Eyes nations have alleged since at least 2012 that Huawei poses a national security threat to the west, especially if it\u2019s allowed to build critical 5G infrastructure around the world. But the national security concerns that have been so far leveled by American intelligence agencies have largely been hypothetical. Any potential specifics on how the Chinese government would use Huawei to make Americans less safe have only been uttered behind closed doors.\n\nFrom the New York Times:\n\nThe lawsuit that Huawei is preparing to file in the United States is expected to challenge a section of a defense spending authorization law that was approved last year. The provision blocks executive agencies from using telecom equipment made by Huawei and another Chinese company, ZTE. According to one of the people familiar with the matter, Huawei\u2019s lawsuit is likely to argue that the provision is a \u201cbill of attainder,\u201d or a legislative act that singles out a person or group for punishment without trial. The Constitution forbids Congress from passing such bills.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTop officials from the Five Eyes countries of the U.S., UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand reportedly met in July of 2018 to discuss the alleged threat from Huawei\u2019s technologies. But, again, the charge that Huawei poses a national security threat is so far pretty vague. A lawsuit brought by Huawei would theoretically force the U.S. government to state its case publicly, and Huawei would essentially be calling the U.S. government\u2019s bluff if U.S. officials couldn\u2019t point to specifics.\n\nBut one can easily imagine a situation where the U.S. government would be hesitant to lay out specific charges against Huawei by citing national security concerns\u2014a kind of Kafkaesque nightmare all around.\n\n\n\nIn January, the U.S. Justice Department announced charges against Huawei that include fraud, obstruction of justice, and the theft of trade secrets. And Huawei\u2019s CFO, Meng Wanzhou, was arrested in Vancouver this past December at the request of the U.S. government for allegedly violating sanctions against Iran. Meng, who is notably the daughter of Huawei\u2019s founder, faces extradition to the U.S. in the very near future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Friday, Meng filed her own civil lawsuit against the Canadian government, claiming multiple violations of her rights under Canada\u2019s Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Chinese government has accused both Canada and the U.S. of staging Meng\u2019s arrest as a purely political stunt and have demanded her immediate release.\n\nHuawei has been on a charm offensive over the past couple of months, with Huawei\u2019s CEO even giving rare interviews to U.S. media. Ren Zhengfei, the billionaire founder and CEO of Huawei, even went so far as to call President Donald Trump a \u201cgreat president.\u201d Trump, who is arguably the dumbest person to ever hold elected office in America, has responded favorably to that kind of flattery in the past.\n\n\u201cNo law requires any company in China to install mandatory back doors,\u201d Ren said on January 15, according to the Wall Street Journal. \u201cI personally would never harm the interest of my customers and me and my company would not answer to such requests.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI love my country, I support the Communist Party. But I will not do anything to harm the world,\u201d Ren said, according to a report in Bloomberg News.\n\nBut Huawei\u2019s public stance has become more adversarial over the past couple of weeks. For example, last week, Huawei\u2019s rotating chairman didn\u2019t pull his punches at the Mobile World Congress 2019 in Barcelona.\n\nDuring his keynote speech, Guo Ping said, \u201cPrism, prism on the wall, who\u2019s the most trustworthy of them all?\u201d a reference to the NSA\u2019s Prism spying program, which became public knowledge in 2013 after whistleblower Edward Snowden exposed details of the effort.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an important question. And if you don\u2019t understand that, you can go ask Edward Snowden,\u201d Guo continued.\n\nHuawei reportedly plans to sue in the Eastern District of Texas, which covers the location of Huawei\u2019s U.S. headquarters in Plano, Texas. Gizmodo will update this post if we hear back from Huawei.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[New York Times]",

    "description": "Amid a firestorm of legal and political salvoes fired at Huawei by the U.S. government, Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei insisted this week that \u201cthere\u2019s no way the U.S. can crush us\u201d while denying that his company will give China\u2019s government backdoor access to its n\u2026",
    "text": "Photo: AP\n\nAmid a firestorm of legal and political salvoes fired at Huawei by the U.S. government, Huawei CEO Ren Zhengfei insisted this week that \u201cthere\u2019s no way the U.S. can crush us\u201d while denying that his company will give China\u2019s government backdoor access to its next-generation 5G network.\n\nOn Monday, Ren sat down with the BBC for his first international broadcast interview since his daughter, Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou, was arrested in Canada on charges of violating U.S. sanctions against Iran. In the next few weeks, Canadian courts are expected to decide whether to comply with an extradition request for Meng to stand trial in U.S. federal court on 13 criminal charges. And while the circumstances are extremely personal for Ren, Huawei has become a flashpoint in the ongoing U.S.-China trade war\u2014one that appears to be testing the U.S.\u2019s ability to bring international allies onto its side.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHuawei is the world\u2019s largest manufacturer of telecom equipment, making it an important player at a time when nations around the world are building out lightning-fast 5G networks that are expected to revolutionize global communications. For the last year, the Trump administration has insisted that Huawei cannot be trusted because it could be forced to give the Chinese government backdoor access to foreign networks. Ren pushed back on that assertion. \u201cThe Chinese government has already clearly said that it won\u2019t install any backdoors,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cAnd we won\u2019t install backdoors either.\u201d He added that he would shut the company down if it were forced to implement backdoors access for the purpose of spying.\n\nThe U.S. government has had a serious distrust for Huawei\u2019s technology for many years, most recently marked by charges levied by the Justice Department against Huawei in late January over alleged theft of trade secrets, obstruction of justice, and sanctions violations. But the timing of the Trump administration\u2019s push to rally other countries against the company has raised concerns that it sees Huawei as a bargaining chip in a multi-billion dollar trade war with China. Ren didn\u2019t get into specifics, but he called the accusations leveled against his company \u201cpolitically motivated.\u201d He added, \u201cThe U.S. likes to sanction others, whenever there\u2019s an issue, they\u2019ll use such combative methods.\u201d\n\nRen may insist that Huawei would never help Chinese espionage operations, but he hasn\u2019t offered any particular assurances that could be independently monitored. All companies operating in China are required to cooperate with the government and have a Communist Party committee in their corporate infrastructure, and Ren confirmed to the BBC the existence of such a committee at Huawei.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRen was relatively sanguine in his assessment of Huawei\u2019s chances of weathering the storm. \u201cThe world cannot leave us because we are more advanced,\u201d he said. The U.S. is not a major market for Huawei, and Ren said that \u201ceven if they persuade more countries not to use us temporarily, we can always scale things down a bit.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, Vice President Mike Pence called on allies \u201cto be vigilant and to reject any enterprise that would compromise the integrity of our communications technology or national security systems.\u201d And last week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned that countries that decide to use Huawei equipment could risk losing partnerships with the U.S. government.\n\n\n\nBut the Trump administration\u2019s weakness in diplomacy is beginning to show. America\u2019s closest ally, the United Kingdom, has expressed confidence that its intelligence services could handle any security risks posed by Huawei equipment, opening the door to a break with U.S. demands. And in recent days, New Zealand, Germany, and Italy have all signaled that they are open to working with Huawei on new 5G networks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStill, the Trump administration is expected to issue an executive order banning Huawei equipment from U.S. wireless networks. Because American telecoms like AT&T and T-Mobile have already said they won\u2019t be using the company\u2019s equipment, the order would be unlikely to have much of an effect on Huawei\u2019s bottom line.\n\nBarring any unexpected events, a Canadian court is expected to hear the extradition case for Meng on March 6. When it comes to his daughter\u2019s criminal case, Ren simply said, \u201cwe\u2019ll let the courts settle it.\u201d\n\n[BBC]",

    "text": "(Reuters) - The surprise arrest of Huawei\u2019s chief financial officer in December quickly turned the executive, Meng Wanzhou, into a central figure in a trade war between two economic superpowers.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A researcher works at a laboratory inside the headquarters of the Chinese telecommunications equipment and smartphone maker Huawei in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, China March 6, 2019. REUTERS/Yuyang Wang\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump told Reuters he would consider intervening in her case - a potential action he alluded to again two weeks ago - if it would help close a trade deal with China.\n\nMeng\u2019s lawyer on Wednesday told a Canadian court that he has concerns the allegations against her have a political character, noting Trump\u2019s comments on the case.\n\nBut U.S. probes of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd for allegedly evading U.S. sanctions on Iran were not rooted in Trump\u2019s trade aspirations. Long before Trump initiated a bitter trade war with China, Huawei activities were under scrutiny by U.S. authorities, according to interviews with ten people familiar with the Huawei probes and documents related to the investigations seen by Reuters.\n\nThe U.S. focus on Huawei intensified after years of investigation into smaller Chinese rival ZTE Corp, and relied in part on information collected from devices of company employees traveling through airports.\n\nTwo of the sources said a critical point took place in August 2017, when deputy U.S. Attorney General Rod Rosenstein - best known for his oversight of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s probe of Russian interference in the U.S. election \u2013 handed a lead role to Brooklyn prosecutors to pursue possible bank fraud charges against Huawei.\n\nFifteen months later, that strategy would help land Meng in a Canadian jail.\n\nThe U.S. investigations of China\u2019s top telecom companies were spurred by reports by Reuters over six years ago, detailing possible Iran sanctions violations by both ZTE and Huawei, as well as close ties between Huawei and Skycom Tech Co Ltd - a suspected front company doing business in Iran.\n\nA spokesman for Huawei, the world\u2019s largest telecommunications equipment maker, has denied the charges in the sanctions case, and did not provide further comment to Reuters. Meng has said she is innocent of the charges. ZTE, which pleaded guilty in 2017 for illegally shipping U.S. goods to Iran, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nU.S. Justice Department spokeswoman Nicole Navas Oxman said the government pursues cases \u201cfree of any political interference and follows the evidence and rule of law in pursuing criminal charges.\u201d\n\nAIRPORT EVIDENCE GRAB\n\nOn December 1, 2018, Meng was stopped at Vancouver International Airport as she walked up the jetway after her flight, according to a lawsuit she filed on Friday accusing the Canadian government of violating her rights. Border officers examined her passport and escorted her to an area for secondary screenings.\n\nWhile there, she was instructed to surrender her two mobile phones, an iPad and a personal computer, along with their passwords, the suit alleges, and the officers viewed the devices\u2019 contents.\n\nReuters has not been able to determine what information was found on Meng\u2019s devices, but it is not the first time she and other Chinese telecom executives have turned over such property to border patrol agents.\n\nIn the years leading up to the Huawei indictment, U.S. officials had been capturing information that would influence the investigation when telecom executives passed through U.S. airports, according to a number of sources familiar with the Huawei and ZTE investigations and the Meng indictment.\n\nFor example, Meng arrived in the United States via John F. Kennedy International Airport in early 2014. The indictment says investigators found \u201csuggested talking points\u201d on one of her electronic devices, stating among other things that Huawei\u2019s relationship with Skycom was \u201cnormal business cooperation.\u201d\n\nMeng had been pulled into a secondary screening at the airport that time as well, and her electronic devices were taken, according to one person familiar with the stop. After a couple of hours, the devices were returned and she was freed to go, the person said.\n\nAnother border search, this time on September 12, 2014, of executives from rival ZTE also supported U.S. investigators long-held suspicions of how Huawei might have been doing illicit business in countries subject to U.S. sanctions, one of the sources told Reuters.\n\nZTE\u2019s CFO at the time was stopped at Boston\u2019s Logan Airport after flying in from London with an assistant, the person said.\n\nThe assistant was carrying a Lenovo laptop containing a confidential ZTE document, dated August 25, 2011 and signed by four top executives, about the need to establish front companies to supply U.S. procured items needed for projects in embargoed countries.\n\nThe airport stop provided key evidence against ZTE in its legal battle with the United States, according to U.S. officials. But it also identified a company as \u201cF7\u201d and how it used a front company to serve as its agent for contracts in sanctioned countries. F7 was Huawei, according to the individuals familiar with the ZTE and Huawei investigations.\n\nThe document was posted on the U.S. Commerce Department website in March 2016 when ZTE was placed on a list of companies that were restricted from buying parts and components from U.S. suppliers. Shortly after the public posting, the New York Times reported that the description of F7 offered by ZTE matched Huawei.\n\nA month later, the Commerce Department sent a subpoena to Huawei in the United States demanding information on the company\u2019s exporting American technology to Iran, according to a court document and one of the people familiar with the Huawei probe.\n\nFROM ZTE TO HUAWEI\n\nWith the case against ZTE wrapping up, more than a dozen people from Departments of Treasury, Commerce, Homeland Security and Justice, gathered in Washington on February 14, 2017 and talked about how they were moving forward against Huawei, according to a person familiar with matter.\n\nBrooklyn prosecutors discussed the relationship between Huawei and HSBC, a bank that was required to cooperate with U.S. prosecutors in any investigation until the end of 2017 for violating U.S. anti-money laundering and sanctions laws, the person added.\n\nIn late 2016, HSBC began to conduct an internal bank probe of Huawei. In the weeks and months following the meeting, HSBC helped authorities obtain evidence of links between Skycom and Huawei, documents reviewed by Reuters show. The probe found Meng met in 2013 with a HSBC banker. She later gave him a copy of the PowerPoint presentation, which the U.S. indictment says misrepresented Huawei\u2019s control of Skycom.\n\nHSBC told Reuters that it provided information in response to demands from the Justice Department.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in Washington, D.C., meanwhile, pursued a more traditional export control investigation against Huawei, which included the accusations of attempted illegal shipments of computers to Iran disclosed in the Reuters 2012 story.\n\nA grand jury subpoena was issued to the U.S subsidiary of the company in April 2017, the first clear sign to Huawei that the probe had turned criminal.\n\nArmed with that knowledge, the company moved U.S.-based Chinese employees who knew about its Iranian dealings out of the country and otherwise concealed and destroyed evidence, the prosecutors allege. Meng and other Huawei executives also began to avoid travel to the United States, prosecutors say.\n\nIn the late summer of 2017, according to two of the sources close to the Huawei investigation, Rosenstein chose Brooklyn as the venue to file charges and the Washington U.S. Attorney\u2019s office dropped out of the case. Brooklyn was already working with a money laundering unit at the Justice Department. The national security division also merged with the Brooklyn prosecution team.\n\nLegal experts said since most evidence of any illegal U.S. goods in Iran presumably existed outside the jurisdiction of U.S. authorities, the bank fraud route presented a potentially quicker path to indictment. They added that bank fraud charges are more likely to lead to arrest by other countries for extradition to the United States than export controls or sanctions violations, and have a longer statute of limitations.\n\nMeng and the company were charged with bank and wire fraud. The PowerPoint presentation\u2019s \u201cnumerous misrepresentations\u201d were central to the charges brought against Meng herself, the indictment shows.\n\nTwelve months after Brooklyn got the case, prosecutors secretly obtained a warrant for Meng\u2019s arrest.\n\nLess than four months later they learned she was stopping in Vancouver en route to Mexico on December 1, and asked the Canadians to detain her at the airport.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Huawei partner offered embargoed HP gear to Iran - reut.rs/2sRL7Ve\n\nSlideshow (6 Images)\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Huawei CFO linked to firm that offered HP gear to Iran - reut.rs/2sUq8RT\n\nEXCLUSIVE: China's ZTE planned U.S. computer sale to Iran - reut.rs/2T17JlN\n\nChinese firm (ZTE) helps Iran spy on citizens - reut.rs/2TlJJJq",

Meng was charged with bank and wire fraud to violate American sanctions against Iran.\n\nIn a civil lawsuit filed in the British Columbia Supreme Court on Friday, Meng\u2019s lawyers said the manner in which officers obtained evidence and information from Meng constituted serious violations of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Meng is the daughter of Huawei\u2019s founder.\n\nIt added that Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) officers deliberately delayed the immediate execution of an arrest warrant and unlawfully subjected Meng to detention, search and interrogation to extract evidence from her before she was arrested.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police - Canada\u2019s federal police - only exercised its arrest warrant three hours after Meng\u2019s \u201cunlawful\u201d detention at the airport, the lawsuit added.\n\nThere was no immediate response from Canada\u2019s justice ministry or the RCMP. The CBSA said it did not comment on matters before the courts.\n\nMeng, who is out on bail, is due to appear in a Vancouver court at 10 a.m. PST (1800 GMT) on Wednesday, when a date will be set for her extradition hearing.

    "description": "China's government and its leading smartphone maker Huawei Technologies Ltd on Monday stepped up pressure on U.S. and Canadian governments in a dispute over market access that has ensnared Huawei's CFO, who faces U.S. criminal charges.",
    "text": "BEIJING/OTTAWA (Reuters) - China\u2019s government and its leading smartphone maker, Huawei Technologies Ltd, stepped up pressure on Monday on the U.S. and Canadian governments in a dispute over trade and telecoms technology that has ensnared Huawei\u2019s CFO, who faces U.S. criminal charges.\n\nChina on Monday accused detained Canadian citizen Michael Kovrig of stealing state secrets passed on to him from another detained Canadian, businessman Michael Spavor, in a move likely to increase tension between Ottawa and Beijing.\n\nThe telecom gear maker is also preparing a lawsuit against the U.S. government over a law that restricts its market access.\n\nIt was the latest escalation of an unprecedented crisis for Huawei, the world\u2019s largest telecommunications equipment maker and No. 2 manufacturer of smartphones, as Washington calls on governments around the world to stop using its gear, particularly in the next generation of telecommunication networks, known as 5G.\n\nSpavor, a business consultant with deep ties to Pyongyang, had been trying to drum up international interest in investing in North Korean economic projects. He and Kovrig, a former diplomat, were picked up in December, shortly after Canada arrested Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou, who faces extradition to the United States.\n\nThe Communist Party\u2019s Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission said Kovrig had often entered China using an ordinary passport and business visas, \u201cstealing and spying on sensitive Chinese information and intelligence via a contact in China.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are obviously very concerned with this position that China has taken,\u201d Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said about the accusations on Monday. \u201cWe\u2019ve been engaging and standing up for the two Canadians who have been arbitrarily detained by China from the very beginning.\u201d\n\nLawyers for Meng are suing the Canadian government, its border agency and federal police, alleging their client was detained, searched and interrogated for three hours in violation of her constitutional rights.\n\nCanada arrested Meng in Vancouver on Dec. 1 at the request of the United States, which has charged her with bank and wire fraud to violate American sanctions against Iran by doing business through a subsidiary it tried to hide.\n\nHUAWEI TO SUE\n\nIn another escalation of the trans-Pacific dispute, Huawei plans to announce a lawsuit against the U.S. government on Thursday on grounds related to a defense bill, a source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.\n\nA woman walks past a Huawei store in Beijing, China March 2, 2019. Picture taken March 2, 2019. REUTERS/Jason Lee\n\nHuawei will challenge an addition to the U.S. National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) signed last year, which controlled U.S. government contracts with Chinese companies and strengthened the role of the panel that reviews foreign investment proposals. Beijing has condemned the NDAA act as targeting China.\n\nTrump last year signed the law that limits Huawei and ZTE Corp\u2019s access to U.S. government and military contracts. That is part of an all-out U.S. effort to close the two companies\u2019 access to not only the U.S. market but major telecoms markets around the world where 5G networks are being designed and built.\n\nU.S. lawmakers introduced bills earlier this year that would ban the sale of U.S. chips or other components to Chinese telecommunications companies that violate U.S. sanctions or export control laws.\n\nU.S. officials have alleged Chinese telecom manufacturers are producing equipment that allows their government to spy on users abroad, including Western researchers working on leading-edge technologies. Beijing and the Chinese companies have repeatedly denied such allegations.\n\nTrump is considering declaring a national emergency that would bar U.S. companies from using telecommunications equipment made by Huawei and ZTE, three sources familiar with the situation told Reuters in December.\n\nThe Justice Department has also charged Huawei with stealing robotic technology from T-Mobile US Inc.\n\nTrump said in February he may or may not include Huawei and ZTE in the trade deal being negotiated with China. Trump told reporters at the White House that U.S. officials were not talking about dropping charges against Huawei.\n\nAlso on Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said he thought his country and China were \u201con the cusp\u201d of a deal to end their trade war.\n\nHUAWEI CFO IN LIMBO\n\nMeng, who is out on bail, is due to appear in a Vancouver court on Wednesday, when a date will be set for her extradition hearing. Ottawa rejects Chinese calls to release Meng, saying it cannot interfere with the judiciary.\n\nThe Canadian government approved her extradition proceedings on Friday. China, whose relations with Canada have deteriorated badly over the affair, denounced the decision and repeated previous demands for Meng\u2019s release.\n\nSlideshow (4 Images)\n\nIt could be years before Meng, the daughter of Huawei\u2019s founder, is sent to the United States since Canada\u2019s slow-moving justice system allows many decisions to be appealed.\n\nA final decision will likely come down to the federal justice minister, who will face the choice of angering the United States by rejecting the extradition bid, or China by accepting it.",

    "text": "Huawei claims that a provision in the law is unconstitutional, as it doesn't afford individual entities such as Huawei the right to a fair trial. Huawei has been accused by the previous and current U.S. governments of having ties to the ruling Communist Party in China, and that it may be pressured to include vulnerabilities in its network equipment that could make it easier for China to commit acts of espionage.\n\nHuawei is trying to turn the tide in its fight against the U.S. government's ban on its network equipment, which has effectively shut down the company's sales in the country. During a press conference in Shenzhen on Thursday morning, the company announced that it is suing the U.S. government in order to attempt to overturn the ban, which was effected in August of last year as part of the National Defense Authorization Act. The Act specifically names Huawei and its fellow Chinese rival, ZTE, as potential threats to U.S. national security.\n\nThe lawsuit comes only a few days after its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, filed a civil suit against Canada's police and border security divisions, claiming \"unlawful interrogation\" in the run-up to her arrest at the Vancouver airport on December 1. She was arrested by Canadian authorities on behalf of the U.S. government, and has been charged with financial fraud and theft of trade secrets. She is being accused of helping her company forge network equipment deals with the Iranian government, in direct violation of U.S. sanctions.\n\nHuawei's lawsuit against the U.S. government comes at a time when it's also being heavily scrutinized by other Western countries; its 5G equipment has also been banned in Australia and New Zealand, and the U.S. has put tremendous pressure on allies like Canada, the UK, Poland, and others to do the same. Huawei contends that it has never and will never open its equipment up to spying, and that it has complied with transparency laws in all of the countries in which it operates.\n\nThe snafu also comes at a time when Huawei is growing its handset business at a fast clip, outpacing much of the industry on its way to overtake Apple as the number two vendor in the U.S. last year. Its executive team has said many times in recent months that they believe Huawei will surpass Samsung as the top-selling smartphone manufacturer within three years.\n\nBut network equipment is where the company makes much of its profits, and while its U.S. ban has not prevented its growth in other parts of the world, it has marred its reputation. Recently, the company launched a Twitter account, Huawei Facts, that uses well-worn PR tropes to push back against negative public opinion.\n\nIn the meantime, the lawsuit may force the U.S. government to provide the evidence of malfeasance that it claims to have on the Chinese networking giant.",

I\u2019m Martin Farrer and these are the top stories on the first Monday of March.\n\nStruggling towns in the north of England and the Midlands will receive a \u00a31.6bn funding boost as Theresa May tries to build support from Labour MPs for her Brexit deal. The prime minister said the \u201cstronger towns fund\u201d would go to areas that had not \u201cshared the proceeds of growth\u201d. Around \u00a31bn had been allocated already, with Brexit-voting towns such as Wakefield, Doncaster, Wigan, Stoke and Mansfield benefiting to the tune of millions of pounds. May will also announce post-Brexit guarantees on workers\u2019 and trade union rights in the coming days. However, Wigan\u2019s Labour MP, Lisa Nandy, who has indicated she might back May\u2019s deal, said the cash would do little to tackle the effects of austerity. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, dismissed the funding as \u201cBrexit bribery\u201d.\n\nTory MPs aren\u2019t too happy with the prime minister either and have warned her not to \u201cbounce\u201d them into a quick vote on her Brexit proposal. The hardline European Reform Group are demanding at least two days of parliamentary time to scrutinise any changes to the Irish backstop that May can wring from Brussels before the \u201cmeaningful\u201d vote promised on 12 March.\n\nKnife summit \u2013 Sajid Javid, the home secretary, will chair a meeting of police chiefs this week to discuss the spate of knife crime across the country that saw two more teenagers killed over the weekend. As the families of Jodie Chesney, who was stabbed in Harold Hill in Essex on Friday, and Yousef Ghaleb Makki, fatally attacked in Hale Barns near Altrincham on Saturday, mourned the two 17-year-olds, Javid said that police forces would be taking action to stem the violence. It comes as figures released today showed a 93% increase in the number of young people targeted by knives.\n\nTornado toll \u2013 At least 23 people are dead after a tornado ripped through the southern US state of Alabama last night. The twister left a trail of \u201ccatastrophic\u201d damage several miles long, according to local sheriffs, and cut off power to more than 10,000 homes. It also spread destruction into Georgia, Florida and South Carolina. Television footage showed smashed buildings with rooftops blown away, cars overturned and debris everywhere.

Trapped on all sides by Kurdish, Syrian and Russian forces, the remnants of the jihadist group are fighting to the death in their last stronghold of Baghuz on the banks of the Euphrates. The notorious caliphate is now \u201ca hellscape of smoke and fire\u201d, Bethan writes. The jihadists face certain military defeat but there is a huge human cost with women and children still fleeing across the lines to escape the barrage. \u201cSmall children kept close to their mothers, their noses, hands and in some cases bare feet turning blue in the biting desert wind. Their faces wore no expressions.

A Guardian investigation reveals that the new members are younger, more radical and more digitally focused than the long-standing senior and more moderate local organisers who are leaving, a change that is also threatening to damage its ability to fight elections. The remaking of the party comes under the leadership of Gerard Batten, who has called Islam \u201ca death cult\u201d and who uses the anti-Muslim activist Tommy Robinson as an adviser.\n\nFreya hits \u2013 Many parts of Britain will wake up to the tailend of Storm Freya this morning after it lashed the country with gale-force winds, heavy rain and snow. Gusts up to 80mph were recorded and a severe yellow warning for strong winds was in place for large parts of the country including Wales, south-west England, the Midlands and northern England. Snow brought traffic to a standstill on the A595 between Carlisle and Cockermouth in Cumbria last night. One driver posted on Twitter that the conditions were \u201cvery severe\u201d.\n\n\u2018An absolute miracle\u2019 \u2013 Two sisters aged five and eight have been found alive and well after going missing for 44 hours in snowbound terrain in California. Leia and Caroline Carrico survived on granola bars after becoming lost near their home in Benbow, north of Sacramento.

    "description": "Ren Zhengfei tells the BBC the world needs Huawei because it's \"more advanced.\" He also denies spying allegations.",
    "text": "Lionel Bonaventure / AFP / Getty Images\n\nRen Zhengfei, Huawei's founder and president, reckons the world needs his company's \"more advanced\" technology.\n\nThe saga of the Chinese telecom has led the US to pressure its international allies to drop Huawei from their 5G rollouts, but Ren told the BBC on Monday that this tactic won't work.\n\n\"There's no way the US can crush us,\" he said in a rare interview. \"The world cannot leave us because we are more advanced. Even if they persuade more countries not to use us temporarily, we can always scale things down a bit.\"\n\nHe noted that the Huawei has plenty of options for expanding its business.\n\n\"If the lights go out in the West, the East will still shine,\" he said. \"And if the North goes dark, there is still the South. America doesn't represent the world. America only represents a portion of the world.\"\n\nNow playing: Watch this: FBI director slams Huawei and ZTE phones\n\nThe founder addressed the December arrest in Canada of Meng Wanzhou, his daughter and Huawei's chief financial officer. He called the arrest a \"politically motivated act\" that he objects to. However, he wants to let the court system iron things out.\n\nRen also strongly denied that his company spies on China's behalf -- the main reason why Huawei networking equipment has been banned in the US since 2012.\n\n\"Our company will never undertake any spying activities,\" he said. \"If we have any such actions, then I'll shut the company down.\"\n\nHe reinforced this point in a separate CBS News interview that will air Wednesday -- an excerpt was released Tuesday. In the interview, he was asked whether Huawei's products could have a backdoor that shares customer data with China without his knowledge.\n\n\"It is not possible. Because across our entire organization, we've stressed once and again that we will never do that. If we did have that, with America's advanced technology, they would found that already,\" he told CBS News.\n\nIn the BBC interview, Ren promised Huawei would \"continue to invest in the UK,\" which reportedly went against the US in concluding that using the company's equipment in its 5G networks is a manageable risk.\n\n\"If the US doesn't trust us, then we will shift our investment from the US to the UK on an even bigger scale,\" he said.\n\nRen seldom speaks to foreign media, but he's already done so several times in 2019. In January, he praised President Donald Trump and said that Huawei is \"only a sesame seed\" in the China's trade war with the US.\n\nFirst published Feb. 19 at 7:03 a.m. PT.\n\nUpdate, 7:57 a.m. PT: Adds quote from CBS News interview.",

    "title": "At MWC 2019, 5G and foldable smartphones go big - CNET",
    "description": "With international intrigue and a 5G coming-out party, this show doesn\u2019t need the boost of a Samsung event.",
    "text": "CNET\n\nSamsung and the MWC Barcelona conference have long had an up-and-down relationship. The energy at the trade show has ebbed and flowed depending on whether the world's largest handset maker decides to hold its big first-half phone launch in Spain. If Samsung shows up, there's a noticeable perk in interest.\n\nOn Wednesday, just days before this year's MWC kicks off, Samsung debuted its Galaxy S10 lineup and its Galaxy Fold. In San Francisco.\n\nYou'd think this would take the wind out of the MWC sails. But between the mix of unique new devices, some international intrigue and, of course, 5G, the show has a good shot of standing on its own without Samsung. MWC traditionally offers you a window into what the smartphone world will look like over the next year. But with 5G, you could be seeing the foundation for how things evolve over the next few years.\n\nNow playing: Watch this: MWC 2019 phone trends we'll see\n\n\"This will be the most consequential MWC since the launch of 4G,\" said Wayne Lam, an analyst at HIS Markit.\n\nWhere CES in January offered a modest tease of what 5G would look like, MWC will be the proper launch of the next-generation cellular technology. After years of hype that 5G will change our lives by connecting everything to a super-fast and super-responsive network, some of the deployments are actually going live.\n\nHeck, even President Donald Trump is tweeting about it.\n\nAnother reason to be excited is the potential to see more foldable smartphones in the works. Samsung may have kicked things off with the Galaxy Fold, but Huawei and Xiaomi may have their own flexible devices. LG, likewise, has an intriguing second-screen attachment for one of its flagship phones.\n\nThe other wrinkle is how Huawei will handle being in the spotlight at the show while dealing with increased global scrutiny over the security of its products. The company typically has a massive presence at MWC, and this year won't be any different.\n\nSo yeah, it's going to be a wild and weird show.\n\n5G, 5G, 5G\n\nIt's 2019, and 5G is finally here. South Korea has switched on the service, although customers and deployments remain limited. In the US, AT&T has real 5G (not the fake 5G E) in a dozen markets, while Verizon has had its 5G Home service up since late last year (some quibble about whether it's real 5G).\n\nCNET\n\nThere's no question we'll see slivers of real 5G deployments throughout the conference, with big-name companies like Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia likely putting up test networks in the Fira Gran Via Convention Center.\n\nIt'll be a good field test of these networks, given the sheer foot traffic and competing cellular demands of so many different deployments.\n\nMWC will also be a good place to see the broader applications beyond a faster smartphone connection. Ericsson in the past has shown how a responsive network can help you remotely drive an excavator thousands of miles away, while Huawei has shown off the potential for smart cities.\n\n\"The mobile industry is moving forward at rapid pace, and we expect the most significant theme of MWC Barcelona to be how 5G will change the world, and in particular the role it will play in ushering in a new era of intelligent connectivity,\" said Mats Granryd, director general of the GSMA, the trade group that puts on the show.\n\nNot just Samsung\n\nThe Galaxy Fold stole the thunder away from the Galaxy S10 at Samsung Unpacked. Foldable phones at MWC could do the same.\n\nWhile Samsung has gotten the jump on the competition, companies like Huawei and Xiaomi could have the last laugh.\n\nCNET\n\nWhile the Galaxy Fold wowed audiences with its demo, Samsung opted not to let anyone get too close to it, and the phone was MIA when the demo area opened up. Another company could steal the spotlight by offering people a closer hands-on with their foldable devices.\n\nAt CES, I tried out the Flexpai from Chinese startup Royole. While the software was buggy, the folding display did work well, and it was easily one of the more impressive things I saw at the show. The point is, the bar is low and tolerance for work-in-progress products is high when it comes to flexible phones.\n\nCNET reported that TCL is working on a family of foldable devices, and could offer a tease at the show too.\n\nRead: Mate X: Huawei's $2,600 foldable phone steps up to Galaxy Fold with three screens, four rear cameras, 5G\n\nInternational intrigue\n\nIt's not all fun and games. One of the undercurrents of the show will be how Huawei deals with the questions over its conduct. The US has led the crusade against the company, with its Justice Department leveling numerous charges, including intellectual theft, fraud and obstruction of justice.\n\nMeng Wanzhou, the company's chief financial officer and daughter of founder Ren Zhangfei, is incarcerated in Canada awaiting extradition to the US on some of the charges laid out by the Justice Department. Huawei has denied any wrongdoing, and Ren said in an interview with CBS This Morning that the move was politically motivated. (Note: CNET and CBS This Morning are both part of CBS.)\n\nHuawei\n\nLikewise, ZTE will be coming back from the brink after a settlement with the US Commerce Department over sanctions related to its work with North Korea and Iran. It kept a low profile at CES 2019, but is expected to back with a press conference in Barcelona.\n\nWild-card devices?\n\nIn the last few years at MWC, phones have emerged out of nowhere to captivate showgoers.\n\nThere's the mysterious LG smartphone with a second-screen attachment. It's not exactly a foldable smartphone, but it's a potentially unique innovation that gets us past the boring rectangular slab.\n\nAndrew Hoyle/CNET\n\nBack in 2017, startup HMD Global, which makes phones using the Nokia brand, caught a lot of attention with its remake of the Nokia 3310, which perfectly tapped into the nostalgia trend that also saw the revival of the NES Classic.\n\nHMD did it again last year with the Nokia 8110, also known as the Matrix phone. Leaks point to a phone with an astounding five cameras on the back.\n\nNokia 9 PureView \"Beholder.\" HNY pic.twitter.com/x4Kh3anP46 \u2014 Evan Blass (@evleaks) December 31, 2018\n\n\n\nPerhaps it'll go for a trifecta of retro phones. Or someone like Chinese phone maker Oppo will come out of nowhere to wow crowds.\n\nWith Samsung out of the mix, anything could happen at MWC.\n\nThe story originally published at 5 a.m. PT.",

    "text": "(Reuters) - The British government has decided it can mitigate the risks arising from the use of Huawei Technologies in 5G networks, the Financial Times reported on Sunday, citing two sources familiar with the conclusion of Britain's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).\n\nThe conclusion reached by Britain would \"carry great weight\" with European leaders, the FT reported, citing a source.\n\n\"Other nations can make the argument that if the British are confident of mitigation against national security threats then they can also reassure their publics and the U.S. administration that they are acting in a prudent manner in continuing to allow their telecommunications service providers to use Chinese components as long as they take the kinds of precautions recommended by the British,\" the source told the newspaper.\n\nHuawei, along with another Chinese network equipment company ZTE, has been accused by the United States of working at the behest of the Chinese government. The United States has said their equipment could be used to spy on Americans.\n\nHuawei has repeatedly denied the claims.\n\nRead more: Two words in Facebook's latest regulatory filing shows how worried the company is about what it's doing to people\n\nEarlier this month, the chief of Britain's foreign intelligence service said Britain should avoid relying on a monopoly provider of equipment in new 5G mobile networks, but that there were no easy answers to concerns about using Huawei.\n\nHuawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou was arrested in Canada in December and faces possible extradition to the United States. Last month Meng, who is the daughter of the Huawei founder, was charged with wire fraud that violated U.S. sanctions on Iran.\n\nHuawei did not respond to requests for comment on Sunday. While NCSC did not directly comment on the FT report, it reiterated earlier concerns about Huawei's engineering and security capabilities.\n\n\"As was made clear in July's HCSEC (Huawei Cyber Security Evaluation Centre) oversight board, the NCSC has concerns around Huawei's engineering and security capabilities. We have set out the improvements we expect the company to make. The latest Annual HCSEC report will be published in the near future.\"\n\n(Editing by David Evans and Sandra Maler)",

    "description": "Last month, the United States Justice Department announced a series of criminal charges against Chinese smartphone maker Huawei for stealing trade secrets, bank fraud, wire fraud, and obstructing justice. Today, The Information has shed light on Huawei's tact\u2026",
    "text": "The Huawei engineer attended the supplier meeting with four Huawei researchers in tow. The Huawei team spent the next hour and a half pressing the supplier for details about the Apple Watch , the executive said.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey were trying their luck, but we wouldn\u2019t tell them anything,\u201d the executive said. After that, Huawei went silent.\n\nLast month, the United States Justice Department announced a series of criminal charges against Chinese smartphone maker Huawei for stealing trade secrets, bank fraud, wire fraud, and obstructing justice. Today, The Information has shed light on Huawei's tactics of stealing trade secrets, some of which were aimed at Apple.According to today's report, a Huawei engineer in charge of the company's smartwatch project tracked down a supplier that makes the heart rate sensor for the Apple Watch . The Huawei engineer arranged a meeting, suggesting he was offering the supplier a lucrative manufacturing contract, but during the meeting his main intent was questioning the supplier about the Apple Watch .This event reportedly reflects \"a pattern of dubious tactics\" performed by Huawei to obtain technology from rivals, particularly Apple's China-based suppliers. According to a Huawei spokesperson the company has not been in the wrong: \"In conducting research and development, Huawei employees must search and use publicly available information and respect third-party intellectual property per our business-conduct guidelines.\"According to the U.S. Justice Department, Huawei is said to have a formal program that rewards employees for stealing information, including bonuses that increase based on the confidential value of the information gathered. While the theft of trade secrets is nothing new among technology companies, the new allegations against Huawei represent \"a more brazen and elaborate system of seeking out secret information,\" The Information reports.Huawei's information gathering program led to incidents like the Huawei engineer probing a supplier for Apple Watch details, as well as Huawei copying a component of the MacBook Pro . Specifically, the company built a connector for its MateBook Pro that was just like the one used in Apple's MacBook Pro from 2016, allowing the computer's hinge to be thinner while still attaching the display to the logic board.Huawei reportedly approached numerous suppliers and provided them with schematics just like Apple's, but most recognized the part and refused to make it for Huawei. The company told The Information that it requires suppliers to uphold a high standard of ethics and that it doesn't seek or have access to its competitor's confidential information. Eventually, Huawei found a willing supplier and the connector was built into the MateBook Pro.The Information's report includes numerous other examples of Huawei's attempts at stealing information from Apple. One former Apple employee interviewed for a job at Huawei immediately after leaving Apple, and in the interview, Huawei executives repeatedly asked questions about Apple's upcoming products. \"It was clear they were more interested in trying to learn about Apple than they were in hiring me,\" the former employee said.Huawei's indictments extend far beyond Apple, including an accusation of bank and wire fraud against chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, lying to the government, destroying documents, and attempting to move key Huawei employees back to China to impede the U.S. Justice Department investigation. Another indictment accused Huawei of stealing trade secrets, wire fraud, and obstructing justice for stealing robotic technology from T-Mobile U.S. for testing smartphone durability.",

    "description": "Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei gave a rare interview to the BBC on Monday, declaring that there's \"no way the US can crush us.\" Ren's daughter, Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou, was arrested in Canada in December last year. He said the arrest was \"politically motivated\" \u2026",
    "text": "The founder of the Chinese phone giant at the heart of a political fight with the US told the BBC that there's \"no way the US can crush us.\"\n\nRen Zhengfei is the founder of Huawei, a company which has come under intense fire from the US in recent months amid fears it is a backdoor for Chinese surveillance and is involved in corporate skullduggery.\n\nIn December 2018, the company's CFO and Ren's daughter, Meng Wanzhou, was arrested in Canada at the request of the US. Since then the US has accused Meng of breaking sanctions, and the company as a whole of stealing trade secrets. Huawei and Meng deny any wrongdoing.\n\nThe US has long frozen Huawei out of its own phone market, citing concerns that the company could act as a backdoor for the Chinese government to spy on US citizens. More recently, the US has been lobbying its allies to forego using any of Huawei's equipment in setting up 5G networks.\n\nRead more: Mike Pompeo is bringing the hammer down on Huawei on his European tour\n\nRen downplayed the power the US had to torpedo Huawei's business. \"There's no way the US can crush us,\" he told the BBC on Monday. \"The world cannot leave us because we are more advanced. Even if they persuade more countries not to use us temporarily, we can always scale things down a bit. \"\n\nHe even spun the US's sustained pressure as a positive. \"Because the US keeps targeting us and finding fault with us it has forced us to improve our products and services,\" he said.\n\nAlthough the US has been able to gain some traction in convincing allies to eschew Huawei's technology, on Sunday the Financial Times reported that the UK government has concluded it can mitigate the security risks.\n\nRen made special mention of the UK in his interview. \"We still trust in the UK, and we hope that the UK will trust us even more. We will invest even more in the UK. Because if the US doesn't trust us, then we will shift our investment from the US to the UK on an even bigger scale,\" he said.\n\nThis defiance marks a change in Ren's rhetoric. Ren struck a much more conciliatory tone in January when he told reporters that he thought Donald Trump was a \"great president.\"\n\nThe arrest of Meng Wanzhou\n\nIn the interview, Ren also spoke about the arrest of his daughter Meng Wanzhou. \"I object to what the US has done. This kind of politically motivated act is not acceptable.\"\n\nHuawei CFO Meng Wanzhou. Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press via AP\n\n\"There's no impact on Huawei's business due to Meng Wanzhou's loss of freedom. In fact, we're growing even faster. So they caught Meng Wanzhou, maybe they got the wrong person,\" he said.\n\n\"They may have thought if they've arrested her, Huawei would fall. But we didn't fall, we are still moving forward.\"",

    "description": "The plan is light on details and loaded with China subtext.",
    "text": "(Photo by Aude Guerrucci-Pool/Getty Images)\n\nPresident Trump today signed an executive order establishing the \"American AI Initiative\" to guide AI development in the United States.\n\nThe Trump administration released details about the initiative ahead of the announcement, and outlined five \"key pillars\" of the overarching US AI strategy, but details are scant on funding, timelines, and the larger geopolitical forces at play behind America's long-awaited move to establish official policy overseeing and governing AI development.\n\nThe Obama administration released a report in 2016 that covered factors such as automation and economic transformation, cybersecurity, research, and foreign policy, but stopped short of providing anything beyond a potential regulatory framework. The American AI Initiative is currently broken down into five core areas:\n\nFunding: The government will direct federal agencies to \"prioritize investments\" in AI research and development, but there are no specifics yet regarding how much funding will be requested and who gets it.\n\nThe government will direct federal agencies to \"prioritize investments\" in AI research and development, but there are no specifics yet regarding how much funding will be requested and who gets it. Government Resources: The initiative will give AI researchers access to federal data and resources such as machine learning algorithms and models to boost development and help researchers train advanced deep learning models and neural networks. The initiative commits to providing computing power in the form of cloud-compute resources to AI-related applications and research projects. No details are provided regarding where those apps will be hosted, i.e. on the government's own servers or through some sort of public-private partnership allocating resources from cloud platform vendors such as Amazon or Microsoft.\n\nThe initiative will give AI researchers access to federal data and resources such as machine learning algorithms and models to boost development and help researchers train advanced deep learning models and neural networks.

No details are provided regarding where those apps will be hosted, i.e. on the government's own servers or through some sort of public-private partnership allocating resources from cloud platform vendors such as Amazon or Microsoft. Automation: Massive changes to the workforce are an inevitability as AI replaces more human jobs and creates new ones. The initiative will direct federal agencies to prepare federal workers for changes in the job market and spearhead retraining programs such as apprenticeships, fellowships, and skill-based technial education. No specifics are given regarding specific industries or job types, or which federal bodies will oversee retraining efforts, but the executive order specifically mentions the importance of STEM education in building future workforce with AI-relevant skills.\n\nMassive changes to the workforce are an inevitability as AI replaces more human jobs and creates new ones.

International Engagement: The initiative calls for the US to work with other nations on collaborative AI development, but do so in a way that protects American \"values and interests.\" This point is all about reading between the lines, where you'll find a big neon sign flashing the word CHINA.\n\nThe initiative calls for the US to work with other nations on collaborative AI development, but do so in a way that protects American \"values and interests.\" This point is all about reading between the lines, where you'll find a big neon sign flashing the word CHINA. Standardization: Creating standards is an oft-discussed topic in AI, but internet standards bodies like the ISO and IEEE have only begun developing technical standards in the past few years. Otherwise, companies have largely been left to their own devices to determine what is considered an ethical use of AI. This initiative positions the US to begin dictating standardization policies around developing \"reliable, robust, trustworthy, secure, portable, and interoperable AI systems,\" through agencies including the National Institute of Standards and Technology and the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.\n\nWe got some more details on the administration's thinking in a Wired op-ed written by Michael Kratsios, the White House Deputy Assistant to the President for Technology Policy. Kratsios talked about an AI future of autonomous cars, industrial robots, and disease diagnosis, framed in terms of American industrial-type dominance over its development.\n\n\"As a result of our long-term emphasis on fundamental research and development, America has been the leader in AI from its inception,\" wrote Kratsios. \"The American AI Initiative will build on this success by leveraging our R&D ecosystem of industry, academia, and government and prioritizing federal investments of cutting-edge ideas that can directly benefit the American people. An integral part of the initiative will include federal agencies developing AI R&D budgets to support their core missions.\"\n\nKratsios said federal agencies will work with industry and educational institutions through the National Council for the American Worker and the Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.\n\nOne factor not mentioned is how Trump's anti-immigrant policies are affecting research talent available in key tech fields such as AI, where professionals are flocking elsewhere in the midst of ongoing uncertainty with visa programs such as H1B. In 2017, 97 tech companies filed an order opposing Trump's immigration ban.\n\nThen there's China. Kratsios talked about \"winning the race for AI,\" but none of the US government's official messaging on the American AI Initiative have explicity named the world's other AI powerhouse, which launched a broad AI funding and development plan in 2017. Eighteen countries including Canda, Denmark, France, Mexico, Singapore, and South Korea currently have fully funded AI strategies in place, but none have the public-private infrastructure and hardware/software pipeline that exists in China.\n\nChinese software giants Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent have a combined market capitalization of more than a trillion dollars, and are only investing more heavily in AI. The big American tech corporations (Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, IBM, and Microsoft) stop the market capitalization charts and remain market leaders in AI investing billions of dollars each year in R&D, but China's state-run goverment allows for an unparalleled level of supply chain control. To reduce reliance on semiconductor importing and feed the demand created by its AI software companies, China is investing $47 billion in semiconductor production to meet the country's future goals.\n\nAmidst the ongoing trade war between the US and China, AI is one of the key tech frontiers\u2014alongside 5G telecomunications infrastructure and quantum computing\u2014on which the battles are already underway. The US has already taken definitive action against Chinese telco manufacturer Huawei, charging the company with dozens of counts of financial fraud and intellectual property theft. And Huawei execs including CFO Meng Wanzhou have been detained.\n\nThe President's executive order calls out China and Huawei in even more explicit terms, with a bullet point that reads: \"The President is also protecting our National Security Innovation Base against those who illicitly acquire America's hard-earned intellectual property.\"\n\nThe administration is also reportedly gearing up to institute a ban on Huawei technology in US wireless networks. The company continues to launch its own 5G tech, which the government is determined to keep far away from the 5G network deployments beginning to roll out across the US this year.\n\nHow the AI race plays out between China and the US has implications not in the global economic power dynamic, but for issues including cybersecurity, military-grade applications of AI, and ethical implications of tech like facial recognition and surveillance systems on civil liberties and privacy.",

    "text": "TORONTO \u2014 An executive of Chinese tech giant Huawei is suing the Canadian government, its border agency and the national police force, saying they detained, searched and interrogated her before telling her she was under arrest.\n\nLawyers for Meng Wanzhou said Sunday they filed a notice of civil claim in the British Columbia Supreme Court. Canada arrested Meng, the daughter of Huawei\u2019s founder, at the request of the U.S. on Dec. 1 at Vancouver\u2019s airport. She is wanted on fraud charges that she misled banks about the company\u2019s business dealings in Iran.\n\nThe suit alleges that instead of immediately arresting her, authorities interrogated Meng \u201cunder the guise of a routine customs\u201d examination and used the opportunity to \u201ccompel her to provide evidence and information.\u201d The suit alleges Canada Border Service Agency agents seized her electronic devices, obtained passwords and unlawfully viewed the contents and intentionally failed to adviser her of the true reasons for her detention. The suit said only after three hours was she told she was under arrest and had right to counsel.\n\n\u201cThis case concerns a deliberate and pre-meditated effort on the part of the defendant officers to obtain evidence and information from the plaintiff in a manner which they knew constituted serious violations of the plaintiff\u2019s rights,\u201d the claim says.\n\nMeng is out on bail and living in Vancouver awaiting extradition proceedings.\n\nOn Friday, Canadian Justice Department officials gave the go-ahead for her extradition proceedings to begin. Meng is due in court Wednesday to set a date for the proceedings to start. It could be several months or even years before her case is resolved.\n\nMeng\u2019s arrest set off a diplomatic furor and severely strained Canadian relations with China. Beijing has accused Washington of a politically motivated attempt to hurt the company.\n\nChina detained former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and Canadian entrepreneur Michael Spavor on Dec. 10 in an apparent attempt to pressure Canada to release Meng.\n\nA Chinese court also sentenced a Canadian to death in a sudden retrial, overturning a 15-year prison term handed down earlier. Kovrig and Spavor haven\u2019t had access to a lawyer or to their families since being arrested.\n\nNicholas Dorion, a spokesman for the Canada Border Services Agency, said it\u2019s not a practice of the agency to comment ?on legal matters that are before the courts. A justice department spokesman referred comment to the border agency and a spokesman of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said they were unlikely to comment Sunday.\n\nGary Botting, a Vancouver extradition lawyer who is not representing Meng, said Canada\u2019s Border Services Agency tends to overstep.\n\n\u201cThey took her under custody without telling her why,\u201d Botting said. \u201cThey disguised the real reason why they detained her. Her rights were violated.\u201d\n\nBotting said they had no reason to detain her as she had travelled to Canada many times before. \u201cThey are trying to get all this information ahead of time and they know ultimately an arrest was in the works,\u201d he said.\n\nJulian Ku, senior associate dean for academic affairs at Hofstra Law, noted the civil action is separate and apart from Meng\u2019s extradition proceeding. He said the lawsuit will allow her to argue she is being unfairly treated and support her broader public relations claim that the detention is part of a U.S and Canadian political conspiracy against Huawei.",

The Canadian Press\n\nHuawei executive Meng Wanzhou has filed a civil claim that alleges members of the RCMP and Canada Border Services Agency breached her constitutional rights when she was arrested in Vancouver on Dec. 1.\n\nMs. Meng\u2019s lawsuit says she was held and questioned for three hours without being advised of her rights and CBSA officers unlawfully searched her electronic devices. She is seeking a declaration that her Charter rights were infringed, along with unspecified damages.\n\nThe arrest of Ms. Meng, who is now free on bail, led to a diplomatic row with China. She was arrested at the request of U.S. authorities who are seeking her extradition to face fraud charges related to alleged attempts to circumvent U.S. sanctions on Iran. Both Ms. Meng and Huawei have denied the U.S. allegations.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nHuawei and Canada: What we know about the company, the arrest and China\u2019s reaction\n\nOn Friday, the Canadian government gave the green light for extradition hearings to proceed, prompting a statement from the Chinese embassy calling the case a \u201cpolitical persecution.\u201d\n\nChina has accused Canada of collaborating with the United States to harass Ms. Meng, chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., China\u2019s largest private company. In apparent retaliation for her arrest, Chinese authorities have detained two Canadians without charge \u2013 Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, both accused of endangering Chinese national security \u2013 and sentenced a third, Robert Schellenberg, to death after a single-day retrial on drug-trafficking charges.\n\nThe allegations in Ms. Meng\u2019s lawsuit describe events that have so far been largely unknown, including how officers approached and immediately questioned her after she exited from the plane.\n\nThe 13-page civil claim, filed Friday in the Supreme Court of B.C. on Ms. Meng\u2019s behalf by Vancouver law firm Gudmundseth Mickelson, lists three unnamed CBSA officers, RCMP Constable Winston Yep and the attorney-general of Canada as defendants.\n\nThe allegations have not been tested in court and the defendants have not yet filed a response.\n\nThe claim states that Canadian regulations allow CBSA officers to conduct routine searches of travellers at ports of entry. But when examinations are not routine \u2013 and in particular, when people are arrested \u2013 travellers are supposed to be informed of their rights, including rights to counsel, under the Charter.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe civil claim alleges Constable Yep and other RCMP officers \u2013 and possibly representatives of the United States Department of Justice \u2013 arranged with the CBSA and its officers to \u201cdetain, search and interrogate\u201d Ms. Meng on her arrival.\n\nAccording to Ms. Meng\u2019s version of events, the officers did so \u201cwithout arresting her, under the guise of a routine customs or immigration related examination,\u201d and then used that opportunity to unlawfully compel her to provide evidence and information, the claim alleges.\n\n\u201cThe Plaintiff was among the first dozen passengers to exit onto the jetway ... upon identifying the Plaintiff the CBSA officers apprehended her and thereafter immediately stopped screening passengers,\u201d the claim states. \u201cCBSA Officers were stationed on the jetway for the sole purposes of detaining the Plaintiff and unlawfully searching and interrogating her before turning her over to the RCMP.\u201d\n\nCBSA officers did not promptly inform Ms. Meng why she was being held or allow her to retain and instruct counsel \u201cwithout delay,\u201d the claim alleges.\n\nThe claim says CBSA officers unlawfully seized devices \u2013 including two cellphones, an iPad and a personal computer \u2013 from Ms. Meng and obtained passwords to search them, without advising her of her right to counsel and her right to silence.\n\nHuawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou is suing the Canadian government, its border agency and federal police. She alleges she was detained, searched and interrogated for three hours in violation of her constitutional rights. Zachary Goelman reports. Reuters\n\nThe RCMP acknowledged a request for comment from The Globe and Mail, but said it was unable to immediately respond. In an e-mail Sunday, CBSA spokesman Nicholas Dorion said the agency does not comment on legal matters that are before the courts.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nScott Bardsley, a spokesman for Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale, said Canada is \u201ca country governed by the rule of law.\u201d\n\n\u201cCanada is conducting a fair, unbiased, and transparent legal proceeding with respect to the arrest of Ms. Meng Wanzhou,\u201d he said Sunday in an e-mail. \u201cWith respect to her notice of claim, we do not comment on matters before the courts.\u201d\n\nGudmunseth Mickelson, the firm representing Ms. Meng in the claim, would not say when they were retained.\n\n\u201cThe claim and its importance speaks for itself and we have nothing further to add at this time,\u201d lawyer Allan Doolittle said Sunday in an e-mail.\n\nMs. Meng had a bail hearing in Vancouver and was released under conditions.

    "text": "Open this photo in gallery Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou arrives at a parole office in Vancouver on Dec. 12, 2018. The federal Justice Department is giving the go-ahead for an extradition case to proceed against Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou, who is wanted in the United States on fraud allegations. Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press\n\nThe Canadian government has given the green light for hearings on whether to hand Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou over to U.S. law authorities.\n\nMs. Meng, a Chinese citizen, was arrested while changing planes at Vancouver International Airport in December, causing a diplomatic rift between Canada and China.\n\nThe federal government took pains to defend Friday\u2019s decision to approve extradition hearings, saying in a news release that Canada is following the letter of the law governing such proceedings.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cCanada is a country governed by the rule of law,\u201d a Department of Justice statement said. \u201cThe decision on whether to issue an Authority to Proceed was made by Department of Justice ... officials who are part of a non-partisan public service.\u201d\n\nThe development drew more ire on Friday from Beijing. China has accused Canada of collaborating with the United States to harass Ms. Meng, a top executive with Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., China\u2019s biggest private company.\n\nThe Chinese embassy in Canada, which has previously called the Meng arrest a \u201cpolitical conspiracy,\" on Friday questioned whether the Canadian government is really bound by the \u201crule of law\u201d in this case, and urged Ottawa to let Ms. Meng go.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese side is utterly dissatisfied with and firmly opposes the issuance of Authority to Proceed by the Department of Justice Canada on the case of Meng Wanzhou,\u201d the embassy said.\n\n\u201cThis is not a merely judicial case, but a political persecution against a Chinese high-tech enterprise. The subsequent developments have proved this. The so-called \u2018rule of law\u2019 and \u2018judicial independence\u2019 asserted by Canada cannot cover up the mistakes made by the Canadian side on the case of Meng Wanzhou.\u201d\n\nOnly days after Ms. Meng\u2019s arrest, and after Beijing threatened \u201cserious consequences\u201d if she was not released, two Canadians were detained in China in apparent retaliation. China\u2019s foreign ministry says both men \u2013 former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and entrepreneur Michael Spavor \u2013 are being held on suspicion of endangering national security. A Chinese court later sentenced to death a Canadian who had previously been jailed for drug smuggling.\n\nU.S. prosecutors accuse Ms. Meng and Huawei of fraud to circumvent U.S. sanctions on Iran. Her defence will hinge on allegations that the U.S. charges are politically motivated, and on proving she did nothing wrong under Canadian law, her lead counsel, Richard Peck, told The Globe and Mail last month.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe Trudeau government has said it is simply complying with the terms of Canada\u2019s extradition treaty with the United States.\n\nOn Friday, the Department of Justice said a review of evidence submitted by the United States has satisfied the conditions required to proceed with an extradition hearing.\n\n\u201cThe department is satisfied that the requirements set out by the Extradition Act for the issuance of an Authority to Proceed have been met and there is sufficient evidence to be put before an extradition judge for decision.\u201d\n\nThe Canadian government noted that the proceeding will not determine whether Ms. Meng is guilty of anything. \u201cAn extradition hearing is not a trial, nor does it render a verdict of guilt or innocence. If a person is ultimately extradited from Canada to face prosecution in another country, the individual will have a trial in that country.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese government remains unconvinced the Trudeau government has no margin to manoeuvre.\n\nHours before the Department of Justice announcement on Friday, China\u2019s Foreign Ministry took Canada to task over possible double standards by commenting at a regular daily news briefing in Beijing on allegations of political interference in the prosecution of Montreal engineering and construction giant SNC-Lavalin Group Inc.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nFormer justice minister and attorney-general Jody Wilson-Raybould testified this week that Mr. Trudeau and senior officials in the Prime Minister\u2019s Office inappropriately pressed her to help the construction giant avoid trial on charges of corruption and fraud. (Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer and NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh are calling on Mr. Trudeau to bring the House of Commons back next week even though a break is scheduled.)\n\nAsked by a state media journalist if it was contradictory for Mr. Trudeau to say he could not interfere in Ms. Meng\u2019s case while his government stands accused of trying to intervene on behalf of SNC-Lavalin, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said he \u201creally liked this question.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course, I think that this is a question that should be asked of the Canadian government,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cNot only Chinese and Canadian citizens, but the whole world is extremely interested to hear how the Canadian government answers this question.\u201d\n\nBoth Ms. Meng and Huawei have denied the U.S. allegations.\n\nUniversity of Ottawa security expert Wesley Wark said extradition could be a lengthy process if there are appeals, and he added that he would not be surprised if Ms. Meng is released as part of a U.S.-China trade deal. \u201cThe best outcome for everyone is if the United States and China come to a trade agreement.\u201d\n\nThe British Columbia Supreme Court has scheduled an appearance for March 6 to set the date for the extradition hearing.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nMs. Meng\u2019s defence team said in a statement that it is disappointed that Justice Minister David Lametti is proceeding with the extradition hearing, citing what it called \u201cthe political nature of the U.S. charges\u201d and U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s suggestion in mid-December that he might use the Huawei executive as a pawn in trade talks.\n\nJames Wu, executive president of the Canada China City Friendship Association, called the Canadian government\u2019s decision to proceed with hearings wrong and unwise.\n\n\u201cThe whole world knows that Mr. Trump is using this case as a bargaining chip, and that it\u2019s obviously a political issue, but the Canadian government cannot make a wise decision, which makes us very angry,\u201d Mr. Wu said.\n\n\u201cThe relationship between Canada and China has already been damaged, and this thing will further damage the friendly relationship between the two countries.\u201d\n\nHowever, Jimmy Yan, a B.C. lawyer who is a frequent commentator on legal issues in the Chinese-language media, said while concerns over U.S. political motivation are legitimate, Canada is merely fulfilling its obligation to an extradition partner.\n\n\u201cThis is an opportunity and, equally, a challenge for Canada to demonstrate the independence and fairness of our court system,\u201d Mr. Yan said. \u201cThere is adequate room for Ms. Meng to defend herself.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nWith a report from Reuters",

    "text": "\n\nChris Bodeen, The Associated Press\n\n\n\n\n\nBEIJING -- China's foreign ministry said Wednesday that it is blocking some imports of Canadian canola due to fears of insect infestation, in what some suggest is just the latest swipe against the Canadian government for arresting a top Chinese tech executive.\n\nAt a daily briefing, Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said China suspended canola imports from a Canadian company \"in accordance with laws and regulations and international practice.\"\n\nLu cited \"harmful organisms\" he did not further identify as a threat, adding that China's government \"needs to protect the health and safety of its own people.\"\n\n\"I can tell you responsibly that the Chinese government's decision is definitely well-founded. Upon verification, China customs has recently detected dangerous pests in canola imported from Canada many times,\" Lu said.\n\nOne of Canada's largest grain processors, Richardson International Ltd., said Tuesday that China had revoked its permit to export canola there amid allegations of an infestation. Canada disputes that claim.\n\nMany see the measure as retaliation for Canada's arrest of Chinese tech giant Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou, the daughter of Huawei's founder.\n\nCanada is proceeding with an extradition hearing for Meng following her December arrest at the request of the U.S., where she is wanted on fraud charges for allegedly misleading banks about the company's dealings with Iran. Meng was set to return to British Columbia Supreme Court for a hearing Wednesday.\n\nIt wouldn't be the first time Beijing has retaliated against nations that offend it. China suspended its bilateral trade deal with Norway and restricted imports of Norwegian salmon after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Chinese political prisoner Liu Xiaobo in 2010.\n\nBritain and other countries were retaliated against over meetings with the Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama, considered a dangerous separatist by Beijing.\n\nCanadian Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau said in a statement that the Canadian Food Inspection Agency conducted investigations after China issued notices of non-compliance on canola seed imports, including nine since January. She said the agency had not identified any pests or bacteria of concern.\n\nChina receives about 40 per cent of Canada's canola exports, and the revocation of Richardson's permit hurts the entire value chain of industries involved in the market, the Canola Council of Canada has said.\n\nNeil Townsend, senior market analyst at FarmLink, however, said he thinks there is a definite link to the Huawei case.\n\n\"There's no doubt China's mad at us,\" he said.\n\nCanola prices already have been hit by China's retaliatory tariffs on U.S. agricultural exports. Further cutbacks on Chinese buying would deal a major blow to what is a lifeline for agriculture in western Canada.\n\n\"I am very concerned by what we've heard has happened to Richardson. We do not believe there's any scientific basis for this,\" Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said Tuesday in Montreal. \"We are working very, very hard with the Chinese government on this issue.\"\n\nChina has warned of serious consequences if the Huawei executive is not released.

    "text": "\n\nChristopher Bodeen and Rob Gillies, The Associated Press\n\n\n\n\n\nTORONTO -- China accused two detained Canadians on Monday of acting together to steal state secrets, just days after Canada announced it will proceed with a U.S. extradition request for a senior Chinese tech executive.\n\nChina arrested the two Canadians on Dec. 10 in what was widely seen as an attempt to pressure Canada to release Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies, who was arrested in Vancouver on Dec. 1 at the request of U.S. authorities.\n\nMeng's arrest set off a diplomatic furor and has severely strained Canadian relations with China.\n\nThe U.S. is seeking the extradiction of Meng, who is also the daughter of Huawei's founder, to face charges she misled banks about the company's business with Iran.\n\nChina's official Xinhua News Agency cited unidentified Chinese authorities as saying former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig violated Chinese laws by acting as a spy and stealing state secrets and intelligence with the help of Canadian businessman Michael Spavor. It was the first time the two men's cases have been linked.\n\nIt said Kovrig often entered China using an ordinary passport and business visas, and acquired information from Spavor, his \"main contact.\"\n\n\"Authorities stressed that China is a country ruled by law and will firmly crack down on criminal acts that severely undermine national security,\" Xinhua said.\n\nThe same information was posted on the official news blog of the ruling Communist Party's Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission.\n\nNo other details were given and Xinhua said further judicial proceedings would \"take place based on the case's progress.\"\n\n\"We are obviously very concerned by this position that China has taken,\" Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said. \"It is unfortunate that China continues to move forward on these arbitrary detentions.\"\n\nKovrig is a former diplomat who was working as an expert on Asia for the International Crisis Group think-tank . Spavor is an entrepreneur known for contacts with high-ranking North Korean officials, including leader Kim Jong Un.\n\n\"We are aware of the Xinhua report of 4 March but have heard nothing official about any charges being laid against our colleague, Michael Kovrig,\" said Hugh Pope, a spokesman for the International Crisis Group.\n\n\"Michael's work for Crisis Group has been entirely transparent and in the open as all who follow his work can attest. Vague and unsubstantiated accusations against him are unwarranted and unfair.\"\n\nAfter Meng's arrest, a Chinese court also sentenced a Canadian to death in a sudden retrial, overturning a 15-year prison term handed down earlier. Kovrig and Spavor haven't had access to a lawyer or to their families since being arrested.\n\nCanada said Friday that it will allow court hearings for the U.S. extradition request for Meng to proceed.\n\nDavid Mulroney, a former Canadian ambassador to China, said the new allegations against Kovrig and Spavor are a response to that action.\n\n\"Every step in the process will be matched by a step by China. The desire is to raise the raise the pressure to extent that we simply give in,\" Mulroney said.\n\nMeng is due in court on Wednesday to set a date for the extradition proceedings to start. It could be several months or even years before her case is resolved\n\nGuy Saint-Jacques, also a former Canadian ambassador to China, said Beijing is clearly putting additional pressure on Canada.\n\n\"It's a predicable escalation in the crisis,\" he said. \"They are probably hoping it will convince the prime minister to free Meng.\"\n\nLawyers for Meng, who is staying at a property she owns in Vancouver after her release on bail, said Sunday she is suing the Canadian government, its border agency and the national police force, alleging she was detained, searched and interrogated before she was told she was under arrest.\n\nMeng's lawsuit alleges that instead of immediately arresting her, they interrogated her \"under the guise of a routine customs\" examination and used the opportunity to \"compel her to provide evidence and information.\"\n\nAlso Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang accused Canada and the U.S. of abusing their bilateral extradition treaty. He reiterated Beijing's demand that Washington withdraw its accusations against Meng.\n\nThe U.S. has been lobbying its allies to shun Huawei's products on national security grounds, saying Chinese law requires the company to provide the government with intelligence on its foreign clients whenever requested.\n\nA Chinese government spokesman took issue Monday with the U.S. claims that Huawei poses a threat to other countries' information security.\n\nSpokesman Zhang Yesui said U.S. officials were taking China's national security law out of context and \"playing up the so-called security risks\" associated with Chinese companies.\n\nThe 2017 law borrows from other countries' experiences and is designed explicitly to \"protect human rights and the lawful rights of individuals and organizations,\" he said.\n\n\"This kind of behaviour is interference into economic activities by political means and is against World Trade Organization rules. It disrupts an international market order that is built on fair competition,\" Zhang told reporters. \"This is a typical case of double standards that is neither fair nor ethical.\"\n\n------\n\nChristopher Bodeen contributed to this report from Beijing.",

    "text": "TORONTO \u2014 Canada's national game \u2014 brought to you by China's Huawei.\n\nAs a nasty diplomatic feud deepens between the two countries over the tech company, involving arrests and execution orders, it hasn't gone unnoticed that Huawei's bright red fan-shaped logo is plastered prominently on the set of \"Hockey Night in Canada.\" TV hosts regularly remind the 1.8 million weekly viewers that program segments are \"presented by Huawei smartphones.\"\n\nThe cheery corporate message contrasts with the standoff over the arrest of Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou on a U.S. warrant. In what looks like retaliation, China detained two Canadians and plans to execute a third \u2014 heavy-handed tactics that, because they leave some Canadians with the impression the privately owned company is an arm of the Chinese government, give its sponsorship a surreal quality.\n\nThe TV deal is one of many examples of how Huawei, the world's biggest telecom gear producer and one of the top smartphone makers, has embarked on a global push to win consumers and burnish its brand. It sponsors Australian rugb y, funds research at universities around the world, and brings foreign students to China for technical training. It has promoted classical music concerts in Europe and donated pianos to New Zealand schools .\n\nIts efforts are now threatened by the dispute with Canada and U.S. accusations that it could help China's authoritarian government spy on people around the world.\n\n\"Huawei's marketing plan up until Dec. 1 (when Meng was arrested) was working very well,\" said Guy Saint-Jacques, a former Canadian ambassador to China. Now, \"public opinion is changing toward China and Huawei.\"\n\nAt stake for Huawei are lucrative contracts to provide new superfast mobile networks called 5G. The U.S. says Meng helped break sanctions and accuses Huawei of stealing trade secrets. It also says the company could let the Chinese government tap its networks, which in the case of 5G would cover massive amounts of consumer data worldwide. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pressed that point to European allies on a tour this week.\n\nHuawei, which did not respond to requests for comment for this story, has previously rejected the allegations. The Chinese government says Huawei's critics were fabricating threats.\n\nStill, the headlines have been relentlessly negative.\n\n\"At some point there could be a majority of Canadians that will say 'We don't think the government should do business with Huawei,'\" said Saint-Jacques.\n\nThere's no evidence of sinister intentions behind Huawei's marketing, which isn't unlike that of Western multinationals, although its efforts have been unusually strong for a company from China, where brands have struggled to capture global attention.\n\nRogers Communications, which broadcasts \"Hockey in Night in Canada\" and also sells Huawei smartphones, said it has no plans to change its sponsorship deal, which started in 2017 and runs to the end of 2020.\n\nIn Australia, the Canberra Raiders rugby team indicated it would renew a Huawei sponsorship deal this year despite a government ban on using its equipment in 5G networks.\n\nHuawei has also ventured into high culture by using its smartphone artificial intelligence to complete the remaining movements in German composer Franz Schubert's \"Symphony No. 8,\" known as the \"Unfinished Symphony.\" It held a symphony orchestra concert in London this month to perform the completed score.\n\nAnd Huawei has a vast network of relationships with universities around the world through research partnerships and scholarships. It has helped fund a 25 million pound ($32 million) joint research project at Britain's Cambridge University.\n\nSome universities have begun to rethink their collaborations, although there's no allegation of wrongdoing by Huawei. Universities point out that companies that fund research don't automatically own any resulting patents.\n\nBritain's Oxford University stopped accepting Huawei's money last month. Stanford University followed suit after U.S. prosecutors unsealed nearly two dozen charges against the company, as did the University of California at Berkeley, which also removed an off-campus videoconferencing set-up donated by Huawei based on guidance from the Department of Defence .\n\nFaced with these setbacks, Huawei has responded by stepping up its public relations efforts.\n\nStory continues",

    "text": "Photo: The Canadian Press Lawyer Andre Lesperance holds up a copy of the decision by the Quebec Court of Appeal.\n\nThe Quebec Court of Appeal has upheld a landmark judgment that ordered three tobacco companies to pay billions of dollars in damages to Quebec smokers.\n\nImperial Tobacco, JTI-Macdonald and Rothmans-Benson & Hedges had appealed a ruling that found the companies chose profits over the health of their customers.\n\nPhilippe Trudel, a lawyer for smokers who brought the class action, called today's appellate court decision a complete victory and excellent news for victims.\n\nIn June 2015, Quebec Superior Court Justice Brian Riordan ordered the companies to make payments of more than $15-billion to smokers who either fell ill or were addicted. At the time, the ruling was believed to be the biggest class action award in Canadian history.\n\nOne lawsuit was started by people who were addicted to cigarettes and couldn't quit, and the second was brought by those who had suffered from cancer or emphysema.\n\nSome 76 witnesses testified at the Superior Court trial and nearly 43,000 documents were deposited as evidence, including internal tobacco company documents that showed smokers didn't know or understand the risks associated with cigarettes.\n\nThe three cigarette companies argued their customers knew the risks of smoking. Moreover, the firms claimed their products were sold legally under strict regulation by the federal government.\n\nTrudel estimated that after the appeal ruling, the total damages owed by the companies would be more than $17-billion.\n\n\"It is excellent news for victims who have been waiting for this day for a long time. We're very happy with the result, clearly,\" he said.\n\nQuebec's highest court, which began hearing the appeal in 2016, struck down almost all of the tobacco companies' grounds for appeal and upheld the judge's decision.\n\nThe court did find the judge erred in several minor aspects, including how the interest was calculated. Trudel called the change a \"technicality\" that would have little effect on the overall damages.\n\n\"Out of all the billions, I don't think they'll call it a victory,\" he said. \"But we call it a total victory on all fronts.\"",

    "text": "BARCELONA, Spain \u2014 China\u2019s Huawei unveiled a new folding-screen phone on Sunday, joining the latest trend for bendable devices as it challenges the global smartphone market\u2019s dominant players, Apple and Samsung.\n\nHuawei revealed its Mate X phone on the eve of MWC Barcelona, a four-day showcase of mobile devices, as the company battles U.S. allegations it is a cybersecurity risk.\n\nThe device can be used on superfast next-generation mobile networks that are due to come online in the coming years.\n\nDevice makers are looking to folding screens as the industry\u2019s next big thing to help them break out of an innovation malaise, although most analysts think the market is limited, at least in the early days.\n\nThe Mate X is the answer to a question Huawei faced as it sought to satisfy smartphone users\u2019 demands for bigger screens and longer battery life, said Richard Yu, CEO of its consumer business group.\n\n\u201cHow can we bring the more big innovation to this smartphone industry?\u201d Yu said at a glitzy media launch.\n\nThe Mate X will sell for 2,299 euros ($2,600) when it goes on sale by midyear. That\u2019s even more than Samsung\u2019s recently revealed Galaxy Fold, priced at nearly $2,000.\n\nThe Mate X\u2019s screen wraps around the outside so users can still view it when it\u2019s closed, unlike the Galaxy Fold, which has a screen that folds shut. Unfolded, the Mate X\u2019s screen is 8 inches diagonally, making it the size of a small tablet.\n\nYu said Huawei engineers spent three years working on the device\u2019s hinge, which doesn\u2019t leave a gap when shut.\n\n\u201cNo matter how innovative and technology-advanced the new device is, it will take a lot more time for a critical mass of consumers to experience the benefits of foldable phones and 5G technology,\u201d Forrester analyst Thomas Husson said. Huawei still \u201chas to find its own brand voice to differentiate from Samsung and Apple and stop acting as a technology challenger.\u201d\n\nHuawei Technologies is trying to raise its profile in the fiercely competitive smartphone market. Almost everyone with a smartphone has heard of Apple and Samsung, the top device makers, and Google, the power behind Android\u2019s pervasive software.\n\nHuawei, a Chinese company with a name many people in the West don\u2019t know how to pronounce (it\u2019s \u201cHWA-way\u201d), wants to join the market\u2019s upper echelon.\n\nIt\u2019s getting close. Samsung was the No. 1 smartphone seller for all of last year, followed by Apple, according to research firm International Data Corp. Huawei came third, though in some quarters it took second place, IDC data showed.\n\nThe company stealthily became an industry star by plowing into new markets, honing its technology, and developing a line-up of phones that offer affordable options for low-income households and luxury models that are siphoning upper-crust sales from Apple and Samsung in China and Europe.\n\nBut Huawei\u2019s products are few and far between in the U.S. The scarcity stems from long-running security concerns that the company could facilitate digital espionage on behalf of China\u2019s government. Washington has been lobbying European allies to keep its equipment out of new 5G networks.\n\nThe cloud over Huawei also includes U.S. criminal charges filed last month against the company and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, who U.S. prosecutors want to extradite from Canada. They accuse her of fraud and say the company stole trade secrets, including technology that mobile carrier T-Mobile used to test smartphones.\n\nHuawei is making its push at a time that both Samsung and Apple are struggling with declining smartphone sales amid a lull in industry innovation that is causing more consumers to hold on to the devices until they wear out instead of upgrading to the latest model as quickly as they once did.\n\nThe company sells high-priced smartphones as well as an extensive range of cheaper models priced from $200 to $600 that offer a good camera and other features most consumers want, analysts said.\n\nBut Huawei wouldn\u2019t be where it is today if it had been content focusing merely on China and other Asian markets.\n\nThe company took a huge step forward several years ago when it began pouring millions into promoting its brand and building partnerships in major European markets such as Germany, France, Britain, Spain and Italy. Research firm Gartner estimates it now sells about 13 per cent of its phones in Europe.\n\nAs for the U.S., Huawei can only make so much headway as long as the government is casting the company as a cyber-villain, said Gartner analyst Tuong Nguyen.\n\n\u201cBrand building is a long-term exercise, but it\u2019s going to be especially difficult in the U.S. because of the way they have branded all of China,\u201d he said. \u201cThe barriers in the U.S. are just getting more difficult.\u201d",

    "description": "'Get back on the job': Notley calls for Trudeau to act after China ban hits Alberta canola producers Edmonton Journal Premier Rachel Notley is demanding Prime Minister Justin Trudeau take action after China blocked some Canadian canola imports, a move which c\u2026",
    "text": "Premier Rachel Notley is demanding Prime Minister Justin Trudeau take action after China blocked some Canadian canola imports, a move which could cost Albertans \u201chundreds of millions\u201d and \u201c3,000 jobs.\u201d\n\nChina\u2019s Foreign Ministry said Wednesday that it is blocking some imports of Canadian canola due to fears of insect infestation. Richardson International Ltd., one of Canada\u2019s largest grain producers, said Tuesday that the country had revoked its permit to export canola there amid infestation allegations. Canada disputes that claim.\n\nNotley, in a Wednesday statement, came out swinging, noting that Richardson International Ltd. exports 30 per cent of Alberta\u2019s canola.\n\n\u201cToday, we learned that the Chinese government is barring a huge chunk of our canola shipments from entering their country. This is wrong and it\u2019s unfair,\u201d said Notley.\n\n\u201cSeventy per cent of agri-food exports to China from Alberta are canola-related products. And canola farming contributes billions to the Canadian economy.\n\n\u201cSo, today, I\u2019m calling on the prime minister to get back on the job and fight for our canola farmers and the jobs they support. We are calling on Ottawa to stop its navel-gazing about its internal controversies and fight back.\u201d\n\nThe premier went on to demand Ottawa \u201cbe in Canada\u2019s corner.\u201d\n\n\u201cAlberta farmers and Alberta workers stand to lose hundreds of millions of dollars and up to 3,000 jobs if this is not resolved,\u201d said Notley.\n\n\u201cWe need certainty.\u201d\n\nFederal Agriculture Minister Marie-Claude Bibeau in a Wednesday statement called the issue a top priority for the Canadian government and said she is in talks with provincial partners.\n\n\u201cOur government understands the importance of the canola industry to the Canadian economy,\u201d said Bibeau. \u201cWe are taking a science-based approach to finding a solution.\u201d\n\nSome observers are speculating that the block may be the latest swipe against the Canadian government for arresting a top Chinese tech executive.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a huge drop-off in canola prices, especially over the past couple of weeks,\u201d said Bruce Burnett, director of weather and markets at Glacier FarmMedia.\n\nHe called it a major drop for the commodity, which likely wouldn\u2019t have happened without the backdrop of a deteriorating relationship between China and Canada. The fallout follows the arrest of Chinese tech giant Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver on Dec. 1, 2018.\n\nOn Dec. 3, the May futures contract, which Burnett noted was not the most actively traded at the time, closed at $496 per tonne. Wednesday afternoon, it was trading at about $456 \u2014 a roughly eight per cent drop. It was expected that exports to China would remain strong through most of the crop year, he said, with fairly solid prices.\n\nCanada exported about $3.6 billion worth of canola seed, oil and meal to China in 2017, according to the Canola Council of Canada\u2019s most recent figures.\n\nNow that China has blocked Richardson\u2019s shipments, the question becomes: what will happen to other companies, Burnett said.\n\nIt\u2019s possible others could have their permits revoked. But, unlike Winnipeg-based Richardson, other players in Canada tend to be part of large multinational organizations. Regina-based Viterra Inc., for example, is part of Switzerland-based Glencore International.\n\nWhile it\u2019s hard to read the minds of what the Chinese government is thinking, it\u2019s likely these companies will be very cautious, he said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s large amounts of money involved here that the companies will be very wary of shipping cargoes that could be rejected or that type of thing.\u201d\n\nSherwood Park\u2019s Ward Toma, general manager of Alberta Canola Producers Commission, said his group has been working with the Canola Council of Canada, which has been working with federal government officials in contact with the Chinese government.\n\n\u201cRight now we\u2019re just hoping for a fast resolution, there\u2019s been very little info of what is going on and we\u2019re waiting to hear more,\u201d Toma said Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\u201cThe longer this drags out, the better the chance that canola prices that farmers get paid will decline. That will impact sales and everyone along the canola chain will be impacted by it.\u201d\n\nAl Mussel, research lead and founder of Agri-Food Economic Systems Inc., said it\u2019s a convenient time for China to decrease the amount of canola it imports because the country is grappling with an outbreak of African Swine Fever, a fatal disease that targets pigs.\n\nThat means China doesn\u2019t need as much canola to feed its pig herd, said Mussell, adding that some estimate the country will drop its pork production by up to 20 per cent this year.\n\n\u2014 With files from The Canadian Press and The Associated Press",

    "description": "U.K. downplays Huawei threat, deals blow to U.S. campaign against Chinese telecom giant The Globe and Mail Britain concludes it can mitigate Huawei risk in 5G networks, newspaper says The Globe and Mail UK reportedly concludes it can mitigate risks associated\u2026",
    "text": "British intelligence officials are saying a total ban on Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd.\u2019s equipment isn\u2019t necessary, dealing a blow to U.S. efforts to rein in the Chinese telecom giant and possibly affecting whether Canada imposes a ban.\n\nOfficials at Britain\u2019s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) have determined that the risks associated with using Huawei\u2019s technology in high-speed 5G networks can be managed. The conclusion comes amid a growing global outcry over Huawei, which is one of the world\u2019s biggest suppliers of equipment for super-fast 5G mobile networks. The United States has been leading a push to ban the company\u2019s technology, arguing that its close ties to the Chinese government make it a security threat. Australia and New Zealand have restricted Huawei\u2019s equipment in 5G networks while France and Germany have raised concerns. The NCSC\u2019s analysis was done as part of a British government review of 5G suppliers that is expected to be completed this spring.\n\nSpeaking to the BBC Monday, Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei said the company will continue to invest in Britain.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cWe will invest even more in the U.K. Because if the U.S. doesn\u2019t trust us, then we will shift our investment from the U.S. to the U.K. on an even bigger scale,\u201d he said.\n\nHe said the arrest of his daughter, chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou, was politically motivated and he denied any wrongdoing.\n\n\u201cI want to object to what the U.S. has done. This kind of politically motivated act is not acceptable,\u201d he said of his daughter\u2019s arrest in Canada at the request of the U.S.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way the U.S. can crush us,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cThe world cannot leave us because we are more advanced ... America doesn\u2019t represent the world. America only represents a portion of the world.\u201d\n\nCanada has also been conducting a cybersecurity review of Huawei\u2019s 5G gear, and the NCSC\u2019s determination will likely be studied closely by Canadian officials. \u201cIt will clearly have an impact on this broader American push to essentially completely lock out Huawei from western systems,\u201d said Raffaello Pantucci, director of international security studies at the London-based Royal United Services Institute. \u201cThe U.K. is fairly highly respected within the international community in this space, in particular amongst the European and western allies. People will know that British institutions won\u2019t have reached this decision, or be leaning in this direction, without giving it a lot of deep consideration.\u201d\n\nBritish security officials do not support a full ban of Huawei from national telecoms networks despite U.S. allegations the Chinese firm and its products could be used by Beijing for spying, people with knowledge of the matter said. Reuters\n\nScott Bardsley, a spokesman for Public Safety Minister Ralph Goodale, said the government was \u201ccarefully assessing the security challenges and potential threats involved in future 5G technology, while recognizing the potential this technology holds for Canadians. We will be taking appropriate decisions in due course.\u201d\n\nThe NCSC has had unique insights into Huawei for nearly a decade. The company opened a special British cybersecurity evaluation centre in 2010 that is overseen by representatives from Huawei, the British intelligence agency and representatives of British mobile phone providers. In a statement released Monday, the NCSC said that it had \u201ca unique oversight and understanding of Huawei engineering and cybersecurity.\u201d The agency added that the latest report of the security centre\u2019s oversight board raised \u201cconcerns around Huawei\u2019s engineering and security capabilities. We have set out the improvements we expect the company to make.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIn a letter to a British parliamentary committee this month, Huawei executive Ryan Ding, who heads the carrier business group, said the cybersecurity centre proves the company\u2019s commitment to transparency and improvement. \u201cIt is true that Huawei\u2019s software engineering has room for improvement. It is also true that the operational quality and performance of our products on live networks are top in the industry,\u201d he wrote in the letter to the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee. He added that allegations against the company in Western media have been exaggerated and that there has never been any proof Huawei poses a security threat.\n\nSeveral British telecom companies, including BT Group and Vodafone, have pulled Huawei equipment from their existing 3G and 4G networks. However, the companies have said a total ban on Huawei would disrupt customers and delay the rollout of their 5G networks. And while telecom companies have privately accepted that Huawei gear will likely be banned from core network functions, they have urged the government to allow the equipment to be used for other services, such as cellular towers.\n\nThe British government has yet to decide on the matter, and on Monday, a spokesperson for Prime Minister Theresa May said the review was continuing. While Ms. May hasn\u2019t spoken out in great length about Huawei, Defence Minister Gavin Williamson has been among the government\u2019s most vocal critics of the company. \u201cI have grave, very deep concerns about Huawei providing the 5G network in Britain,\u201d he said recently. \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019d have to look at very closely. We\u2019ve got to look at what partners such as Australia and the U.S. are doing in order to ensure that they have the maximum security of that 5G network, and we\u2019ve got to recognize the fact, as has been recently exposed, that the Chinese state does sometimes act in a malign way.\u201d\n\nTensions over Huawei have also increased since the company\u2019s chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, was arrested in Canada in December. She faces extradition to the U.S. on allegations of fraud related to the violation of trade sanctions on Iran.\n\nMr. Pantucci said the NCSC\u2019s approach to assessing the risk of Huawei is prudent and that Western governments need to be careful when making generalizations about the company. \u201cMy sense is we should be determining these things based on the degree of risk and danger that\u2019s posed, and the threat that\u2019s posed, rather than a blanket political determination on all products from certain countries,\u201d he said. He added that there was also a bigger question concerning how Western countries engage with China. The engagement must be \u201cwith open eyes and aware of the potential risks and dangers,\" he said. \u201cWe just have to look at this in a very objective fashion and not make blanket determinations on everything Chinese.\u201d",

    "description": "Trudeau has lost the moral mandate to govern The Globe and Mail Scheer: Trudeau should resign over SNC-Lavalin affair Toronto Sun LILLEY: Wilson-Raybould drops a bomb on Trudeau Toronto Sun The moral catastrophe of Justin Trudeau Maclean's Wilson-Raybould say\u2026",
    "text": "Justin Trudeau should ask the Governor-General to dissolve Parliament immediately, with a general election to follow in April. Instead, he and his remaining advisers will likely hunker down and hope that time dulls the public outrage over his acts.\n\nBut let there be no mistake: According to Wednesday\u2019s testimony from Jody Wilson-Raybould, the Prime Minister and his most senior advisers gravely undermined the rule of law when they repeatedly urged her as attorney-general to interfere in the criminal prosecution of SNC-Lavalin for partisan political reasons. To have then threatened her when she refused, and to have removed her from her portfolio when she would not bow to those threats, was reprehensible.\n\nA prime minister who has been accused of such abuses by his own former attorney-general should no longer have the confidence of the House of Commons. This government should fall.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nInstead, the Liberal caucus will probably continue to support their leader out of blind loyalty. And the strategists preparing for the scheduled October election doubtless already have the lines out: The Prime Minister was only trying to preserve the thousands of jobs that would be at risk if SNC-Lavalin were convicted; no one intended to press or threaten the former minister; the final decision was always hers to make.\n\nThis may wash with some people, but won\u2019t with many others. Ms. Wilson-Raybould\u2019s testimony Wednesday was so utterly damning that the Liberals no longer have a moral mandate to govern.\n\nThe testimony last week of Michael Wernick, Clerk of the Privy Council, now makes sense. When he insisted that no one applied \u201cinappropriate pressure\" to Ms. Wilson-Raybould, the nation\u2019s most senior public servant must have hoped to cauterize the impact of her testimony before she gave it. If so, he failed. Few people of goodwill who listened to Ms. Wilson-Raybould as she carefully but relentlessly described a campaign of pressure, partisan concerns, intimidation and threats, based on the meticulous notes she made of each meeting, will believe him and not her.\n\nThe Clerk\u2019s testimony seems even more strident and ill-advised in light of what she said.\n\nBut it is Mr. Trudeau\u2019s actions that deserve the fiercest condemnation. When the first Globe and Mail story appeared saying Ms. Wilson-Raybould had been pressed to defer the prosecution of SNC-Lavalin, and he said the story was false, he must have known it was not false.\n\nWhen he said that if Ms. Wilson-Raybould had any concerns, she had an obligation to raise them, he must have known she had raised those concerns with growing alarm at each meeting that she insisted should not even be taking place.\n\nWhen he said that Ms. Wilson-Raybould would be attorney-general today had Scott Brison not stepped down as president of Treasury Board, forcing a cabinet shuffle, he must have known that Ms. Wilson-Raybould thought she was being forced out of her portfolio because she would not bend to his will.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nAnd when he told reporters time and again that the Canadian authorities detained Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou for an extradition hearing because Canada is a nation of the rule of law, he must have known that he was being a rank hypocrite. He was throwing the rule of law in the ditch every time he tried to force his attorney-general to abandon a criminal prosecution because he needed to get re-elected.\n\nYou might well believe that, despite these serial abuses, the Liberals are still best-suited to govern the country, and Mr. Trudeau to lead the party. You might believe that he was only trying to save jobs and pensions at SNC-Lavalin, and that the other parties are too far to the right or left. That would be reasonable.\n\nBut it would also be reasonable to believe that Mr. Trudeau abused the powers of his office, and that his most senior advisers abused theirs, and that Canadians no longer have confidence in their federal government. That Finance Minister Bill Morneau, who also tried to put pressure on Ms. Wilson-Raybould to cut SNC-Lavalin some slack, no longer has a mandate to present a budget. That this government can no longer represent Canada before the world.\n\nLet the guys in the war room scheme about how they can rescue the party\u2019s reputation between now and the scheduled October election. Let the partisans recite their lines in front of the cameras. The right thing to do is to let the people decide the fate of this government. The right thing to do is have an election now.\n\nThe former attorney-general explains how she was asked to help SNC-Lavalin avoid prosecution, raising the spectre of job losses in Quebec during an election.

    "description": "Chinese CFO claims she was detained and interrogated before being told she was under arrest Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officers of Chinese tech giant Huawei, is suing the Canadian government, its border agency and the national police force over her hig\u2026",
    "text": "Chinese CFO claims she was detained and interrogated before being told she was under arrest\n\nMeng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Chinese technology company Huawei, is suing the Canadian government, its border agency and the national police force over her high-profile detention. Meng claims they detained, searched and interrogated her before telling her she was under arrest.\n\nLawyers for Meng said on Sunday they had filed a notice of civil claim in the British Columbia supreme court. Canada arrested Meng, the daughter of Huawei\u2019s founder, at the request of the US on 1 December at Vancouver airport. US prosecutors will accuse her of misleading banks about the company\u2019s business dealings in Iran.\n\nMeng\u2019s lawsuit alleges that instead of immediately arresting her, authorities interrogated her \u201cunder the guise of a routine customs\u201d examination and used the opportunity to \u201ccompel her to provide evidence and information\u201d.\n\nCanada approves Huawei extradition process, sparking ire from China Read more\n\nThe suit also claims Canada Border Service Agency agents seized her electronic devices, obtained passwords and unlawfully viewed the contents and intentionally failed to adviser her of the true reasons for her detention. The suit said only after three hours was she told she was under arrest and had right to counsel.\n\n\u201cThis case concerns a deliberate and pre-meditated effort on the part of the defendant officers to obtain evidence and information from the plaintiff in a manner which they knew constituted serious violations of the plaintiff\u2019s rights,\u201d the claim says.\n\nMeng has been released on bail and is living in Vancouver awaiting extradition proceedings.\n\nOn Friday, Canadian justice department officials gave the go-ahead for her extradition proceedings to begin. Meng was due in court on Wednesday to set a date for the proceedings to start. It could be several months or even years before her case is resolved.\n\nMeng\u2019s arrest set off a diplomatic furore and severely strained Canadian relations with China. Beijing has accused Washington of a politically motivated attempt to hurt the company.\n\nHuawei founder: US cannot crush technology firm Read more\n\nChina detained former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and Canadian entrepreneur Michael Spavor on 10 December in an apparent attempt to pressure Canada to release Meng.\n\nA Chinese court also sentenced a Canadian to death in a sudden retrial, overturning a 15-year prison term handed down earlier. Kovrig and Spavor haven\u2019t had access to a lawyer or to their families since being arrested.\n\nNicholas Dorion, a spokesman for the Canada Border Services Agency, said it\u2019s not a practice of the agency to comment on legal matters that are before the courts. A justice department spokesman referred comment to the border agency and a spokesman of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said they were unlikely to comment Sunday.\n\nJulian Ku, senior associate dean for academic affairs at Hofstra Law, noted the civil action is separate and apart from Meng\u2019s extradition proceeding. He said the lawsuit will allow her to argue she is being unfairly treated and support her broader public relations claim that the detention is part of a US and Canadian political conspiracy against Huawei.\n\nLynette Ong, an associate professor of political science at the University of Toronto who focuses on China, quipped that the detained Canadians should take Beijing to court for violation of basic human rights, taking a leaf from the Meng lawsuit.\n\n\u201cThe violation of their human rights is so much more grave than violation of her constitutional rights,\u201d Ong said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not even possible for them. The fact that they were denied a lawyer in the first place means they are not entitled to any justice.\u201d",

    "description": "Toll on human health may not become clear for decades \u2026 Theresa May ranked as \u2018populist\u2019 world leader \u2026 and why anti-Zionist is not antisemitic Hello I\u2019m Warren Murray and it\u2019s Thursday, all day. Continue reading...",
    "text": "Top story: Lakes, rivers and reservoirs widely contaminated\n\nHello I\u2019m Warren Murray and it\u2019s Thursday, all day.\n\nMicroplastic pollution spans the world, according to new studies showing contamination in the UK\u2019s lakes and rivers, groundwater in the US, the Yangtze River in China and along the coast of Spain. We don\u2019t yet know what ingesting them means for human health \u2013 and experts are worried that the full implications might not be understood for decades. One study has found the tiny particles can harbour harmful microbes, including bugs that cause gastroenteritis and wound infections.\n\nIn the UK there was microplastic pollution in all 10 lakes, rivers and reservoirs sampled. The particles are shed by synthetic clothing, vehicle tyres and through the spillage of plastic pellets used by manufacturers. The physical breakdown of plastic litter also creates them. Rain washes them into rivers and the sea, but they can also be blown by the wind and end up in fields when treated sewage waste is used as fertiliser.\n\nKirsten Thompson from the University of Exeter, who is working with Greenpeace on a survey of microplastics in the UK\u2019s major rivers, said: \u201cWe hope our research will help uncover exactly where this plastic is coming from and what impact it may be having.\u201d\n\n\u2018Live up to the moment\u2019 \u2013 France\u2019s Europe minister, Nathalie Loiseau, has urged Britain to offer fresh proposals to end the Brexit impasse as she prepares to meet Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, in London today.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nathalie Loiseau, the French minister for Europe. Photograph: Ludovic Marin/AFP/Getty Images\n\nLoiseau said she supported an extension of article 50 if there was a \u201cgood and credible reason\u201d but warned that uncertainty about the UK\u2019s departure from the EU was affecting its neighbours. On the rights of British citizens in France in the event of no deal, she insisted: \u201cWe are happy to have them in France living, studying, working, enjoying life in our country and we want them to remain.\u201d Meanwhile, Downing Street has insisted the latest meaningful vote on Theresa May\u2019s Brexit deal will go ahead as promised on Tuesday, despite the stalled state of negotiations with Brussels about how to get around the Irish border backstop.\n\nNo Grenfell charges any time soon \u2013 Survivors and the bereaved from the Grenfell Tower fire have expressed \u201cextreme frustration\u201d after Scotland Yard admitted no charges were likely for at least two years. The Guardian understands police have so far interviewed 11 people, individually and as representatives of organisations, under criminal caution for offences ranging from manslaughter to health and safety breaches. Detectives have said their investigation must take into account the public inquiry into the disaster, the second phase of which will not start until the end of this year. Scotland Yard said in a statement it was unlikely to submit a file to prosecutors before \u201cthe latter part of 2021\u201d. The announcement means any trials might not start until 2022 \u2013 about five years after the fire that shocked the nation and killed 72 people.\n\nSalvaging Neverland \u2013 Michael Jackson\u2019s estate is engaging in a campaign of adverts, lawsuits and interviews to counter the screening of Channel 4\u2019s documentary, Leaving Neverland, which details years of alleged grooming and child abuse. The pop star\u2019s supporters held a small protest outside Channel 4\u2019s headquarters in London on Wednesday before the first instalment of the show was broadcast. In her four-star review, Guardian TV critic Lucy Mangan calls the film \u201can astonishing piece of work, relentlessly spare and unsensationalist \u2026 Journalistic and legal standards require neutrality be observed, but as a viewer it\u2019s hard to escape the conclusion that the star \u2013 who openly admitted he slept with boys in his bed, and was trailed by accusations of child molestation for the last 15 years of his life \u2013 did exactly what these men say he did.\u201d\n\nThe new populism \u2013 A two-decade surge in populist rhetoric is revealed in a Guardian-commissioned study of speeches by prime ministers, presidents and chancellors in 40 countries. The research shows how politicians on both the left and right have gradually framed politics as a battle between the will of ordinary people and corrupt, self-serving elites. Findings suggest the number of leaders identifiable as populist has more than doubled since the early 2000s. The most significant expansion has been in the last five years with the elections of Donald Trump, Narendra Modi in India, Mexico\u2019s Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador and Brazil\u2019s Jair Bolsonaro \u2013 the data ranks them as \u201csomewhat populist\u201d, while the band of \u201cvery populist\u201d leaders is dominated by Latin American leftists like Hugo Ch\u00e1vez, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, Evo Morales and Rafael Correa. British PMs including Blair, Brown and Cameron all score very low but Theresa May ranks at the low end of the \u201csomewhat populist\u201d band.\n\n\u2018Project Casear\u2019 \u2013 The firm founded by Sir Lynton Crosby and Mark Textor, the C|T Group, was engaged by multinational mining giant Glencore to bankroll a secret, globally coordinated campaign to prop up coal demand, a Guardian investigation can reveal. The covert campaign, called \u201cProject Caesar\u201d, had an annual war chest of between \u00a34m and \u00a37m, and used teams in Sydney and London to undermine environmental activists, influence politicians and spread sophisticated pro-coal messaging on social media. Campaign teams helped set up online grassroots groups to push positive messaging about clean coal technology, attack renewables and criticise political parties opposed to the use of coal.\n\nOther side of the Glory Hole \u2013 A bird that was filmed going down a gigantic drain \u2013 given the dubious local nickname of \u201cGlory Hole\u201d \u2013 in a dam in California reportedly survived and emerged on the other side.\n\nPlay Video 0:16 Bird swims headfirst into 'glory hole' and survives \u2013 video\n\nRick Fowler, the water resources manager at Lake Berryessa, who was holding the camera, says that after he captured the bird going in, he ran to where he could see the outflow and \u201cthwack \u2013 it shot out of there like a bullet\u201d. At first it looked dead, but then flew to a calm spot and shook itself dry. It probably made it through because it was a cormorant \u2013 the oily-feathered divers have been recorded at ocean depths of of 150ft. \u201cNobody ever thinks of anything going down that thing and being able to survive,\u201d said Fowler. \u201cBut he survived all right. I watched it.\u201d\n\nToday in Focus podcast: Grayling\u2019s failings\n\nThe transport secretary, Chris Grayling, has fought off calls for him to resign over a series of costly controversies. But was the man at the centre of them all really to blame? The Guardian\u2019s Peter Walker looks back at a catalogue of crises that have earned the cabinet minister the nickname \u201cFailing Grayling\u201d. Plus: Rob Evans on the blacklisting of trade unionists and the role of undercover police.\n\nLunchtime read: Why anti-Zionist is not antisemitic\n\nAll over the world, it is an alarming time to be Jewish \u2013 but conflating anti-Zionism with Jew-hatred is a tragic mistake, writes Peter Beinart.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest People protest outside Governor Andrew Cuomo\u2019s office in New York City over boycotts against Israel. Photograph: Pacific Press/Getty Images\n\n\u201cAnti-Zionism is not inherently antisemitic \u2013 and claiming it is uses Jewish suffering to erase the Palestinian experience,\u201d Beinart writes. \u201cYes, antisemitism is growing. Yes, world leaders must fight it fiercely. But in the words of a great Zionist thinker, \u2018This is not the way\u2019.\u201d\n\nSport\n\nOle Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r praised \u201cfearless\u201d Marcus Rashford after his nerveless penalty in added time swept Manchester United into the Champions League quarter-finals on a memorable night at Parc des Princes. There was drama too at the Estadio do Dragao, where Porto converted a penalty awarded after a VAR review three minutes from the end of extra time to beat Roma 3-1 and reach the last eight. England\u2019s 3-0 win over Japan in the SheBelieves Cup showed Phil Neville\u2019s entire squad \u201ccan deliver when they need to\u201d, according to defender Leah Williamson.\n\nRich Ricci, the former executive chairman of the defunct bookmaker BetBright, has said that while he can \u201cunderstand why some customers are upset\u201d about its decision to void all open ante-post bets, it was the \u201cmost equitable\u201d way to wind up the business. World Rugby has insisted promotion and relegation will be a part of its proposed new world league despite opposition from within the Six Nations. And Andy Murray says he gambled on the advice of a leading London hip specialist after years of listening to surgeons who told him the operation he opted for would not save his tennis career.\n\nBusiness\n\nDonald Trump keeps saying that the trade talks with China are going well but the tensions with Beijing are intensifying after Chinese tech company Huawei filed a lawsuit against Washington for banning its products. It comes as Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou fights extradition from Canada to the US on charges of misleading banks on the firm\u2019s dealings with Iran.\n\nOn the markets, Asian shares were subdued after a poor seesion on Wall Street.

Con\u2026",
    "text": "Top story: Tom Watson \u2013 \u2018I love this party but sometimes don\u2019t recognise it\u2019\n\nHello, it\u2019s Warren Murray on a morning when \u201cleave\u201d and \u201cremain\u201d have taken on new meaning in the Labour party.\n\nThe seven MPs who have quit in frustration at Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s leadership will go into the day hoping to persuade more parliamentary colleagues to join their grouping. If the Independent Group can convince another 29 disaffected MPs from any party to join them, they would gain official third party status \u2013 overtaking the SNP \u2013 and receive taxpayer funding. Those who resigned \u2013 Luciana Berger and Chuka Umunna, along with Ann Coffey, Mike Gapes, Chris Leslie, Gavin Shuker and Angela Smith \u2013 attacked Corbyn\u2019s leadership of Labour, accusing him of betraying members and the country with his Brexit stance and presiding over a party in denial of its antisemitism problem.\n\nPlay Video 2:14 'We have all now resigned': seven Labour MPs quit party \u2013 video\n\nTom Watson, Labour\u2019s deputy leader, warned that \u201ctime is short for us to confront the scale of the problem and meet the consequences, to keep others from leaving \u2026 To put it mildly, we need to be kinder and gentler. I love this party. But sometimes I no longer recognise it.\u201d There had long been rumours that dozens of Labour MPs were likely to quit but in the end the number was smaller, as some wanted to see Umunna and Berger test the water with donors, supporters and MPs from other parties. Even among those with no plans to quit, a string of Labour MPs from Yvette Cooper to Lisa Nandy have publicly made clear that they want to see change from the Labour leadership. Meanwhile there has been strong speculation that several centrist Conservative politicians are considering their future under Theresa May because of her policy towards the EU. Umunna has worked closely with Tories including Anna Soubry, the MP for Broxtowe, Heidi Allen, the MP for South Cambridgeshire, and Sarah Wollaston, the MP for Totnes, on the push for a second Brexit referendum.\n\nOf the seven who quit on Monday, Angela Smith has the slimmest electoral majority in her constituency of Penistone and Stocksbridge. At the Legion club in Penistone, opinion appeared split. \u201cI just can\u2019t vote for Angela Smith,\u201d said Mick Drewry, 66, accusing her of undermining Corbyn. But, \u201cI think she\u2019s done the right thing \u2013 I think they all have, the seven,\u201d said Angela Spivey, 61, a lifelong Labour voter until Corbyn became leader. \u201cI think it\u2019s about time we did have a new party \u2013 I would probably vote for them if they bring out good policies.\u201d\n\nRosenstein on the way out \u2013 Overnight it has emerged that Rod Rosenstein \u2013 the US deputy attorney general who appointed Robert Mueller as Trump-Russia inquisitor, to Donald Trump\u2019s fury \u2013 is to leave the White House in mid-March. It was known he would leave upon the new attorney general, William Barr, taking office to replace Jeff Sessions. But the timing of the news lines up with Rosenstein\u2019s appearance in the news in recent days, over claims that he sounded out cabinet members about using their constitutional power to dismiss Trump from the presidency. Within the last day Trump has attacked Rosenstein, accusing him of \u201cplanning a very illegal act\u201d.\n\nRule out no deal, May told \u2013 Ministers have demanded that Theresa May stop using a no-deal Brexit as a negotiating tactic because of the damage being done to British business. The point has been underlined with Honda set to announce the closure of its Swindon factory which employs 3,500 people and guarantees many more jobs in the UK automotive supply chain. It has been described as a \u201cshattering body blow\u201d for British manufacturing. Four ministers \u2013 David Gauke, Amber Rudd, Greg Clark and David Mundell \u2013 have met with May and told her that while the no-deal threat was once a valid negotiating tactic, alarming announcements by businesses and manufacturers mean it is time to categorically rule it out. British people are shopping on, though, according to a survey \u2013 more than half have no plans to change their spending habits. The PM is expected to visit Brussels on Wednesday while the attorney general, Geoffrey Cox, will soon set out what changes he considers necessary to eliminate the risk of being trapped in the Irish backstop. The Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, is due to brief cabinet today about his latest talks with the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier.\n\nSearch for missing beachgoers \u2013 A British tourist and his French travelling companion have gone missing at an Australian beach during rough sea conditions. Police and emergency services are searching for Hugo Palmer and Erwan Ferrieux, both 20, after their belongings were found by walkers on Shelley Beach in New Wouth Wales on Monday. The men\u2019s rental car was parked nearby, probably since Sunday, and police said if they had gotten into difficulty in the water their chances of survival were \u201cexceptionally slim\u201d as weather conditions had been \u201cterrible\u201d.\n\nKurds seek protection in Syria endgame \u2013 The leader of Syria\u2019s Kurds has called for an international force to protect her people around the Turkish border. The Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, has warned America that a Turkish military operation is imminent against the US-backed Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units. \u201cWe would like to see an international power on the border as observers to ensure that Turkey does not attack,\u201d said Ilham Ahmed, leader of the political arm of the US-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which have been responsible for liberating much of north-eastern Syria from Islamic State. Erdo\u011fan views Kurdish forces in Syria as \u201cterrorists\u201d and an extension of the Kurdish separatist movement within Turkey\u2019s own borders.\n\nWe\u2019ll do it Huawei \u2013 The telecommunications magnate Ren Zhengfei has declared \u201cthere\u2019s no way the US can crush us\u201d as the row continues over whether his Huawei company\u2019s technology is a gateway for hacking by Chinese intelligence agencies. \u201cThe world cannot leave us because we are more advanced. Even if they persuade more countries not to use us temporarily, we can always scale things down a bit,\u201d said Ren, whose daughter, Meng Wanzhou, is being kept in Canada on a US arrest warrant for fraud and sanctions violations. Washington has reportedly pressed the UK and other allies not to use the firm\u2019s technology in critical infrastructure. Ren said: \u201cWe will continue to invest in the UK \u2026 Our company will never undertake any spying activities.

    "text": "Huawei president Ren Zhengfei: We won't spy on US even if Chinese law requires us to, what backdoors?\n\nIn his first U.S. TV interview, Ren Zhengfei describes Huawei as \u201ca tomato\u201d crushed between two superpowers.\n\nIn his first American television interview, Huawei Technologies president and founder Ren Zhengfei says that even if the Chinese government mandates it by law, the company would not help China spy on the U.S.\n\nIn the image above, Zhengfei (right) is seen with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the company's London office. There is a close relationship between Huawei and the state, as required by law.\n\nIn recent months, intelligence officials in the United States have raised concerns over Huawei's capacity to backdoor its devices to help China spy on Americans.\n\nHuawei CFO Meng Wanzhou, who is Zhengfei's daughter, was recently arrested in Canada, and the U.S. is trying to extradite her for charges that include wire fraud.\n\n\"Absolutely not possible. And also, we never participate in espionage and we do not allow any of our employees to do any act like that. And we absolutely never install backdoors. Even if we were required by Chinese law, we would firmly reject that,\" Ren told \"CBS This Morning\" co-host Bianna Golodryga in Beijing.\n\nFrom CBS News\n\nU.S. officials point to a 2017 Chinese law requiring its companies to assist in national intelligence gathering. In January, the Department of Justice hit Huawei with 23 criminal charges, alleging bank and wire fraud, violating sanctions on Iran, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. \"Huawei and its senior executives repeatedly refused to respect U.S. law and standard international business practices,\" FBI Director Christopher Wray said. Huawei's CFO, Meng Wanzhou, was arrested in Canada where she's currently under house arrest. \"I think detaining, arresting Miss Meng Wanzhou is politically motivated,\" Ren said. Meng is also Ren's daughter. \"She's facing extradition to the United States. These are serious charges leveled against her,\" Golodryga said. \"Why do you call these charges politically motivated?\" \"I can only answer your question after the court makes its decision,\" Ren said. Asked whether he has a statement as to whether or not Huawei violated international sanctions, Ren said, \"We still have to wait till the court makes the decision.\" \"Do you feel that you, your company and your daughter are used as a tool?\" Golodryga asked. \"I think both China and the United States are of large scale. And while those powers clash, our company is as small as a tomato. We are not that \u2014 we do not carry that big weight, and neither does Miss Meng Wanzhou. And I don't think Meng Wanzhou has anything to do with the clashes between the two powers.\"\n\nCBS: Huawei founder says he would defy Chinese law on intelligence gathering\n\nRelated: Huawei president: We're not going to spy on the US, even if the Chinese government says we have to",

The most sensitive topics of 2018 included: 1. China-US trade war 2. US sanctions against ZTE 3. The arrest of Meng Wanzhou, CFO of Huawei in Canada 4.

    "description": "While Huawei is selling tons of phones worldwide, it\u2019s facing a grim time in the US with plenty of lawsuits and governmental bans against it over surveillance concerns. Most notably, the company\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, Meng Wanzhou, has been arrested and i\u2026",
    "text": "While Huawei is selling tons of phones worldwide, it\u2019s facing a grim time in the US with plenty of lawsuits and governmental bans against it over surveillance concerns. Most notably, the company\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, Meng Wanzhou, has been arrested and is facing a potential sentence of up to 30 years in a US prison. Let\u2019s back up a bit, and take a look at how Huawei got into this massive mess.\n\nFirst, a bit of context: Huawei\u2019s a big deal, not just in China, but across the globe. The company supplies telecom equipment to 170 countries, and crossed $100 billion revenue in the last financial year. It also manufactures laptops, smart fitness devices, microchips, and delivers network services.\n\nOn December 1, 2018, Canadian authorities arrested 47-year-old Meng \u2013 who happens to be the daughter of the company\u2019s founder Ren Zhengfei \u2013 in Vancouver, on the request of the American government. She was charged with violation of the US\u2019 sanctions to Iran, allegedly helping Huawei cover up wire frauds run by China. A few days later, Chinese authorities said that Meng\u2019s arrest was possibly a violation of human rights, and demanded that Canada release her immediately.\n\nCredit: Wikimedia Commons Meng Wanzhou, CFO, Huawei\n\nOn December 12, less than two weeks after the CFO\u2019s arrest, Canadian authorities granted her conditional bail for $7.5 million. Now, she can roam only in a 100-mile radius of Vancouver with an 11 pm curfew, a GPS bracelet tied to her ankle, and a private security firm tracking her movements round the clock.\n\nLate in January, the US justice department filed criminal charges against Meng, and requested filed a formal extradition request with Canada.\n\nHuawei\u2019s founder Ren Zhengfei\n\nLast night, Ren told BBC in an interview that Meng\u2019s arrest was politically motivated. He also reiterated that Huawei will never undertake any spying activities. Additionally, Ren claimed that \u201cthe US can\u2019t crush us,\u201d and the world needs Huawei, as it\u2019s \u201cmore advanced.\u201d\n\nMeng\u2019s comments sound like a retort to US President Trump\u2019s decision to ban the use of Huawei and ZTE equipment for government purposes, back in August 2018. And previously, US officials accused Huawei of spying on behalf of China using its equipment last February.\n\nThese indictments can significantly impact the Chinese tech giant\u2019s progress in North America; carriers and big-box retailers like Best Buy have refused to work with Huawei due to the government\u2019s pressure. In addition, Trump\u2019s aforementioned order meant that the company can\u2019t work with government contractors and supply its products to US government agencies.\n\nIn 2017, business from the US accounted for 7% of Huawei\u2019s revenue. After these bans and virtually no presence in the American smartphone market, that figure will likely shrink a great deal. Regardless of whether it\u2019s a major loss for Huawei\u2019s bottom line, the company\u2019s reputation around the world will likely take a hit if it\u2019s booted from the US entirely.\n\nThe company\u2019s also one of the biggest network equipment manufacturer in the world, and holds a key place in the world\u2019s march towards a 5G future. Experts have warned that if the US chooses not to use Huawei\u2019s devices, its 5G rollout might slow down over the next couple of years. Japan, New Zealand, and Australia have also banned Huawei, while Canada, the UK, and Germany are considering blocking deals with the firm.\n\nAll eyes will be on Huawei in the coming year to see if it can convince these countries to use its products and services again.\n\nRead next: Here are the 5 hottest startups in Finland",

    "title": "Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou Is Suing Canada Over Her Detention",
    "description": "She alleges that agents interrogated her \"under the guise of a routine customs\" interview before telling her she was under arrest",
    "text": "(TORONTO) \u2014 An executive of Chinese tech giant Huawei is suing the Canadian government, its border agency and the national police force, saying they detained, searched and interrogated her before telling her she was under arrest.\n\nLawyers for Meng Wanzhou said Sunday they filed a notice of civil claim in the British Columbia Supreme Court. Canada arrested Meng, the daughter of Huawei\u2019s founder, at the request of the U.S. on Dec. 1 at Vancouver\u2019s airport. She is wanted on fraud charges that she misled banks about the company\u2019s business dealings in Iran.\n\nThe suit alleges that instead of immediately arresting her, authorities interrogated Meng \u201cunder the guise of a routine customs\u201d examination and used the opportunity to \u201ccompel her to provide evidence and information.\u201d The suit alleges Canada Border Service Agency agents seized her electronic devices, obtained passwords and unlawfully viewed the contents and intentionally failed to adviser her of the true reasons for her detention. The suit said only after three hours was she told she was under arrest and had right to counsel.\n\n\u201cThis case concerns a deliberate and pre-meditated effort on the part of the defendant officers to obtain evidence and information from the plaintiff in a manner which they knew constituted serious violations of the plaintiff\u2019s rights,\u201d the claim says.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now\n\nMeng is out on bail and living in Vancouver awaiting extradition proceedings.\n\nOn Friday, Canadian Justice Department officials gave the go-ahead for her extradition proceedings to begin. Meng is due in court Wednesday to set a date for the proceedings to start. It could be several months or even years before her case is resolved.\n\nMeng\u2019s arrest set off a diplomatic furor and severely strained Canadian relations with China. Beijing has accused Washington of a politically motivated attempt to hurt the company.\n\nChina detained former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and Canadian entrepreneur Michael Spavor on Dec. 10 in an apparent attempt to pressure Canada to release Meng.\n\nA Chinese court also sentenced a Canadian to death in a sudden retrial, overturning a 15-year prison term handed down earlier. Kovrig and Spavor haven\u2019t had access to a lawyer or to their families since being arrested.\n\nNicolas Dorion, a spokesman for the Canada Border Services Agency, said it\u2019s not a practice of the agency to comment on legal matters that are before the courts. A justice department spokesman referred comment to the border agency, and a spokesman for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said they were unlikely to comment Sunday.\n\nGary Botting, a Vancouver extradition lawyer who is not representing Meng, said Canada\u2019s Border Services Agency tends to overstep.\n\n\u201cThey took her under custody without telling her why,\u201d Botting said. \u201cThey disguised the real reason why they detained her. Her rights were violated.\u201d\n\nBotting said they had no reason to detain her as she had travelled to Canada many times before. \u201cThey are trying to get all this information ahead of time and they know ultimately an arrest was in the works,\u201d he said.\n\nJulian Ku, senior associate dean for academic affairs at Hofstra Law, noted the civil action is separate and apart from Meng\u2019s extradition proceeding. He said the lawsuit will allow her to argue she is being unfairly treated and support her broader public relations claim that the detention is part of a U.S and Canadian political conspiracy against Huawei.\n\nLynette Ong, an associate professor of political science at the University of Toronto who focuses on China, quipped that the detained Canadians should take Beijing to court for violation of basic human rights, taking a leaf from the Meng lawsuit.\n\n\u201cThe violation of their human rights is so much more grave than violation of her constitutional rights,\u201d Ong said. \u201cBut that\u2019s not even possible for them. The fact that they were denied a lawyer in the first place means they are not entitled to any justice.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.",

    "text": "What do the U.S.-China trade war, Huawei\u2019s Meng Wanzhou and the world\u2019s first alleged gene-edited baby have in common? They\u2019re all controversial subjects in China, and were among the most censored topics last year on the country\u2019s ubiquitous social media app, WeChat, according to new research.\n\nLast year, WeChatscope, a research project at the University of Hong Kong, tracked more than 4,000 public accounts covering daily news on WeChat. Of the 1.04 million articles reviewed, 11,000 were removed, the researchers revealed earlier this week.\n\nAssociate professor King-wa Fu, who leads the project at the university\u2019s Journalism and Media Studies Center, said Sino-U.S. relations were among the most censored topics last year.\n\n\u201cThere were disputes regarding ZTE and Huawei, multiple rounds of trade negotiations, and finally, the arrest of Huawei CTO, Meng Wanzhou, at the end of 2018,\u201d he told TIME.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now\n\nThe researchers\u2019 list of the ten most controversial topics also revealed that the #MeToo hashtag was heavily censored, as was coverage of the allegation that Peking University tried to silence activists protesting a two-decades-old rape allegation involving a former professor. A vaccine scandal in July that saw one of the country\u2019s largest vaccine makers distribute substandard vaccines to thousands of babies also made the list.\n\nThe WeChatscope team arrived at these findings by building a technical web \u201cscraping\u201d system. By tracking the thousands of public accounts posting daily news, the system was able to detect when a post disappeared.\n\nThe researchers said the most common official reason provided for disappeared articles was that the content was \u201cdeleted by the publisher.\u201d\n\n\u201cSelf-censorship is a common practice among internet users in China as online speech can easily bring them trouble,\u201d the report said.\n\n\u201cUsers will often remove their own posts if they receive warning from senior colleagues or employers,\u201d it added.\n\nThe three other prevailing reasons were that the content was found by censorship authorities to violate regulations, the user was blocked or the content was reported.\n\nFu predicts that the U.S.-China trade dispute will continue to be the main topic censored on WeChat in 2019.\n\n\u201cThere will be a lot more developments, most immediately with the tariff deadline coming up,\u201d Fu says, referring to a tariff hike that may impact another $200 billion of Chinese imports on March 2.\n\nIn 2018, China was the worst abuser of internet freedom for the fourth consecutive year, according to a study conducted by Freedom on the Net. In addition to operating its own sophisticated internet censorship apparatus known as the \u201cGreat Firewall\u201d, China is also training other countries on its model, exporting hardware and advanced data tools to allow repressive regimes to control their netizens.\n\nWrite to Hillary Leung at hillary.leung@time.com.",

    "text": "(TORONTO) \u2014 China accused two detained Canadians on Monday of acting together to steal state secrets, just days after Canada announced it will proceed with a U.S. extradition request for a senior Chinese tech executive.\n\nChina arrested the two Canadians on Dec. 10 in what was widely seen as an attempt to pressure Canada to release Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies, who was arrested in Vancouver on Dec. 1 at the request of U.S. authorities.\n\nMeng\u2019s arrest set off a diplomatic furor and has severely strained Canadian relations with China.\n\nThe U.S. is seeking the extradition of Meng, who is the daughter of Huawei\u2019s founder, to face charges she misled banks about the company\u2019s business with Iran.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now\n\nChina\u2019s official Xinhua News Agency cited unidentified Chinese authorities as saying former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig violated Chinese laws by acting as a spy and stealing state secrets and intelligence with the help of Canadian businessman Michael Spavor. It was the first time the two men\u2019s cases have been linked.\n\nIt said Kovrig often entered China using an ordinary passport and business visas, and acquired information from Spavor, his \u201cmain contact.\u201d\n\n\u201cAuthorities stressed that China is a country ruled by law and will firmly crack down on criminal acts that severely undermine national security,\u201d Xinhua said.\n\nThe same information was posted on the official news blog of the ruling Communist Party\u2019s Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission.\n\nNo other details were given and Xinhua said further judicial proceedings would \u201ctake place based on the case\u2019s progress.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are obviously very concerned by this position that China has taken,\u201d Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said. \u201cIt is unfortunate that China continues to move forward on these arbitrary detentions.\u201d\n\nKovrig is a former diplomat who was working as an expert on Asia for the International Crisis Group think tank. Spavor is an entrepreneur known for contacts with high-ranking North Korean officials, including leader Kim Jong Un.\n\nRob Malley, president of the International Crisis Group, said the accusations against Kovrig are unsubstantiated and unfounded.\n\n\u201cMichael worked transparently and openly, keeping Chinese authorities informed of what he did and of his mandate: to advise all parties, Beijing included, on steps they could take to resolve and prevent deadly conflict around the world,\u201d Malley said.\n\n\u201cBut false accusations aside, the reality is clear for all to see. The timing of Michael\u2019s detention and his citizenship leave little doubt as to why he is being arbitrarily detained. We continue to hope that China will do the right thing and release him so that he can be reunited with his family.\u201d\n\nAfter Meng\u2019s arrest, a Chinese court also sentenced a Canadian to death in a sudden retrial, overturning a 15-year prison term handed down earlier. Kovrig and Spavor haven\u2019t had access to a lawyer or to their families since being arrested.\n\nCanada said Friday that it will allow court hearings for the U.S. extradition request for Meng to proceed.\n\nDavid Mulroney, a former Canadian ambassador to China, said the new allegations against Kovrig and Spavor are a response to that action.\n\n\u201cEvery step in the process will be matched by a step by China. The desire is to raise the raise the pressure to extent that we simply give in,\u201d Mulroney said.\n\nMeng is due in court on Wednesday to set a date for the extradition proceedings to start. It could be several months or even years before her case is resolved\n\nGuy Saint-Jacques, also a former Canadian ambassador to China, said Beijing is clearly putting additional pressure on Canada.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a predicable escalation in the crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are probably hoping it will convince the prime minister to free Meng.\u201d\n\nLawyers for Meng, who is staying at a property she owns in Vancouver after her release on bail, said Sunday she is suing the Canadian government, its border agency and the national police force, alleging she was detained, searched and interrogated before she was told she was under arrest.\n\nMeng\u2019s lawsuit alleges that instead of immediately arresting her, they interrogated her \u201cunder the guise of a routine customs\u201d examination and used the opportunity to \u201ccompel her to provide evidence and information.\u201d\n\nAlso Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang accused Canada and the U.S. of abusing their bilateral extradition treaty. He reiterated Beijing\u2019s demand that Washington withdraw its accusations against Meng.\n\nThe U.S. has been lobbying its allies to shun Huawei\u2019s products on national security grounds, saying Chinese law requires the company to provide the government with intelligence on its foreign clients whenever requested.\n\nA Chinese government spokesman took issue Monday with the U.S. claims that Huawei poses a threat to other countries\u2019 information security.\n\nSpokesman Zhang Yesui said U.S. officials were taking China\u2019s national security law out of context and \u201cplaying up the so-called security risks\u201d associated with Chinese companies.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.",

As Democrats begin lining up to run against him next year, the President may be hoping to avoid the stock-market gyrations and economic pain an escalating trade war might soon begin to inflict.\n\nHe could surely use what he sees as a big political win on China at a time when multiple investigations, increasingly aggressive Democratic lawmakers, his failure to build a border wall and embarrassing public testimony from his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen are all clouding his political horizons.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now\n\nBut as with his would-be reset with Russia, Trump can\u2019t change the structural game with China with a single agreement. Although Trump entered office predicting he would improve relations with Moscow, lawmakers of both parties continue to accuse Russia of interference in U.S. elections and various other crimes. Sanctions remain in place and may well expand. Neither Trump\u2019s praise nor congressional punishment has persuaded Russia to change course.\n\nThe same goes for China. Trump will doubtless win some concessions from Xi, perhaps expanded access for U.S. companies to the Chinese marketplace, agreements on currency management, more Chinese purchases of American soybeans and promises in principle to address other U.S. demands.\n\nWhat Trump cannot do is persuade Xi to overhaul China\u2019s broader economic model. The Chinese state will continue to subsidize state-owned companies and privately owned national champions, tilting the global playing field in its favor. It will push forward, by any means necessary, on expanding technological innovation to compete with U.S. and European firms in the most important economic sectors of the 21st century\u2013AI, fintech and consumer electronics, for example. On these subjects, whatever Xi promises Trump or Chinese officials say publicly, they will not compromise.\n\nThere are also limits to what Trump can offer to get that deal with Xi. If he signs off on an agreement that removes pressure on Chinese telecom giants Huawei and ZTE, each suspected of undermining U.S. national security, he\u2019ll get pushback from Congress. If he tries to use Meng Wanzhou\u2013the Huawei executive arrested in Canada for allegedly violating U.S. sanctions on Iran\u2013as a bargaining chip, he\u2019ll face criticism that he\u2019s meddling in a law-enforcement matter and exceeding his authority.\n\nEven if Trump and Xi cheer markets in March with a broad Mar-a-Lago agreement over coffee and chocolate cake, the damage to relations between the superpower and the rising challenger has already been done. Trust between them now stands at its lowest point in 30 years, and each government will continue a long-term project of making its side less vulnerable to pressure from the other.\n\nIn short, the U.S.-China relationship is fundamentally broken, and no politically inspired, vaguely worded compromise will change that.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.\n\nThis appears in the March 11, 2019 issue of TIME.",

    "description": "China's Huawei unveiled a new folding-screen phone on Sunday, joining the latest trend for bendable devices as it challenges the market.",
    "text": "(BARCELONA, Spain) \u2014 China\u2019s Huawei unveiled a new folding-screen phone on Sunday, joining the latest trend for bendable devices as it challenges the global smartphone market\u2019s dominant players, Apple and Samsung.\n\nHuawei revealed its Mate X phone on the eve of MWC Barcelona, a four-day showcase of mobile devices, as the company battles U.S. allegations it is a cybersecurity risk.\n\nThe device can be used on superfast next-generation mobile networks that are due to come online in the coming years.\n\nDevice makers are looking to folding screens as the industry\u2019s next big thing to help them break out of an innovation malaise, although most analysts think the market is limited, at least in the early days.\n\nThe Mate X is the answer to a question Huawei faced as it sought to satisfy smartphone users\u2019 demands for bigger screens and longer battery life, said Richard Yu, CEO of its consumer business group.\n\n\u201cHow can we bring the more big innovation to this smartphone industry?\u201d Yu said at a glitzy media launch.\n\nThe Mate X will sell for 2,299 euros ($2,600) when it goes on sale by midyear. That\u2019s even more than Samsung\u2019s recently revealed Galaxy Fold, priced at nearly $2,000.\n\nThe Mate X\u2019s screen wraps around the outside so users can still view it when it\u2019s closed, unlike the Galaxy Fold, which has a screen that folds shut. Unfolded, the Mate X\u2019s screen is 8 inches diagonally, making it the size of a small tablet.\n\nYu said Huawei engineers spent three years working on the device\u2019s hinge, which doesn\u2019t leave a gap when shut.\n\n\u201cNo matter how innovative and technology-advanced the new device is, it will take a lot more time for a critical mass of consumers to experience the benefits of foldable phones and 5G technology,\u201d Forrester analyst Thomas Husson said. Huawei still \u201chas to find its own brand voice to differentiate from Samsung and Apple and stop acting as a technology challenger.\u201d\n\nHuawei Technologies is trying to raise its profile in the fiercely competitive smartphone market. Almost everyone with a smartphone has heard of Apple and Samsung, the top device makers, and Google, the power behind Android\u2019s pervasive software.\n\nHuawei, a Chinese company with a name many people in the West don\u2019t know how to pronounce (it\u2019s \u201cHWA-way\u201d), wants to join the market\u2019s upper echelon.\n\nIt\u2019s getting close. Samsung was the No. 1 smartphone seller for all of last year, followed by Apple, according to research firm International Data Corp. Huawei came third, though in some quarters it took second place, IDC data showed.\n\nThe company stealthily became an industry star by plowing into new markets, honing its technology, and developing a line-up of phones that offer affordable options for low-income households and luxury models that are siphoning upper-crust sales from Apple and Samsung in China and Europe.\n\nBut Huawei\u2019s products are few and far between in the U.S. The scarcity stems from long-running security concerns that the company could facilitate digital espionage on behalf of China\u2019s government. Washington has been lobbying European allies to keep its equipment out of new 5G networks.\n\nThe cloud over Huawei also includes U.S. criminal charges filed last month against the company and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, who U.S. prosecutors want to extradite from Canada. They accuse her of fraud and say the company stole trade secrets, including technology that mobile carrier T-Mobile used to test smartphones.\n\nHuawei is making its push at a time that both Samsung and Apple are struggling with declining smartphone sales amid a lull in industry innovation that is causing more consumers to hold on to the devices until they wear out instead of upgrading to the latest model as quickly as they once did.\n\nThe company sells high-priced smartphones as well as an extensive range of cheaper models priced from $200 to $600 that offer a good camera and other features most consumers want, analysts said.\n\nBut Huawei wouldn\u2019t be where it is today if it had been content focusing merely on China and other Asian markets.\n\nThe company took a huge step forward several years ago when it began pouring millions into promoting its brand and building partnerships in major European markets such as Germany, France, Britain, Spain and Italy. Research firm Gartner estimates it now sells about 13 percent of its phones in Europe.\n\nAs for the U.S., Huawei can only make so much headway as long as the government is casting the company as a cyber-villain, said Gartner analyst Tuong Nguyen.\n\n\u201cBrand building is a long-term exercise, but it\u2019s going to be especially difficult in the U.S. because of the way they have branded all of China,\u201d he said. \u201cThe barriers in the U.S. are just getting more difficult.\u201d\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.",

    "text": "If last year was the Xi Jinping show, the 2019 National People\u2019s Congress (NPC) \u2014 China\u2019s annual rubberstamp parliament \u2014 has been all about the economy.\n\nTwelve months have past since Xi\u2019s coronation as China\u2019s most powerful leader since Mao Zedong at last year\u2019s NPC, when presidential term limits were officially scrapped and Xi\u2019s eponymous political thought enshrined in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) charter. By comparison, this year\u2019s NPC, which opened Tuesday, had a markedly less triumphant feel.\n\nIt\u2019s hardly surprising. Growth had slipped to its slowest rate in 28 years while crucial exports have also shrunk. Xi\u2019s signature Belt and Road Initiative \u2014 a Beijing-bankrolled trade and infrastructure network tracing the ancient Silk Road \u2014 has encountered opposition from Hanoi to Madrid. Governments around the world are raising concern about China\u2019s tech ambitions, particularly security concerns regarding 5G rollout.\n\nPremier Li Keqiang sounded a cautionary note during Tuesday\u2019s Work Report, which forms the NPC\u2019s opening address and is akin to a State of the Union. Next year\u2019s growth forecast would be between 6% and 6.5%, Li revealed, the lowest level since 1990, with Li stressing \u201cgraver,\u201d \u201cunpredictable\u201d and \u201cmore complex\u201d risks ahead, while steering clear of acknowledging any missteps by the Xi leadership.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now\n\n\u201cThe more pressure Xi is under the less scope he has to acknowledge mistakes,\u201d says Steven Tsang, director of SOAS China Institute.\n\nNone of those pressures loom as large as the ongoing trade war with Washington. Li conceded that \u201ctrade disputes\u201d had negatively impacted the economy, but insisted that Beijing had \u201cappropriately\u201d handled the situation. Beijing and Washington are close to finalizing a trade deal, according to U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cOutside of its own long list of domestic challenges, relations with the U.S. are of paramount concern for Xi Jinping and the Chinese leadership,\u201d says Jude Blanchette, a senior China analyst for Crumpton Group, a business consulting firm.\n\nTellingly, there was no mention of Made in China 2025 in the 35-page Work Report. The key strategic gambit to dominate certain hi-tech industries \u2014 such as aeronautics, Artificial Intelligence and semi-conductor chips \u2014 prompted a backlash from Washington, which has suggested it flouts WTO rules.\n\nTrump has already accused Beijing of massive intellectual property theft while Meng Wanzhou, CFO of Chinese telecoms firm Huawei, awaits possible extradition from Canada to the U.S. to answer charges of flouting U.S. sanctions on Iran.\n\nLi\u2019s omission of Made in China 2025 \u2014 which featured in his previous three Work Reports \u2014 was probably \u201ca sop to Trump but I can\u2019t imagine Beijing ever abandoning said program\u2019s high-technology objectives,\u201d says Sean King, a former U.S. diplomat and now senior vice-president of political risk firm Park Strategies.\n\nLi also announced a significant 3% cut in VAT for manufacturers to 13%, while VAT for construction and transport companies was trimmed to just 9%, in an attempt to boost private businesses. Local governments will be allowed to issue $320 billion worth of \u201cspecial purpose\u201d bonds.\n\nBut the announcement of tax cuts and infrastructure spending also signifies the government is willing to let its debt mountain \u2014 already estimated at three times GDP \u2014 grow in a bid to stabilize the economy and head off a possible rise in unemployment.\n\nAs a result, \u201cthe government\u2019s fiscal position at both the central and local levels will deteriorate, while looser controls over lending to small companies could lead to widening bad debts,\u201d writes Tom Rafferty, principal economist for China for the Economist Intelligence Unit.\n\nLi also announced efforts to improve social services, particularly education and healthcare, which are much maligned and a growing source of popular discontent. The government will incentivize investment in elderly care facilities and nurseries to address the ticking demographic time-bomb of China\u2019s rapidly aging population.\n\nOverall, the NPC is shaping up as an attempt to steady the ship amid disquiet from within the CCP and outside about Xi\u2019s helmsmanship in the face of unprecedented headwinds.\n\nStill, \u201cIt\u2019s important that we don\u2019t confuse more outspoken grumbling about Xi\u2019s rule with an actual organized challenge,\u201d says Blanchette, highlighting that his \u201ccontrol over the military and security services still appears firm.\u201d Ultimately, he adds, \u201cIt\u2019s time we start imagining Xi ruling China for the next few decades.\u201d\n\nWrite to Charlie Campbell at charlie.campbell@time.com.",

    "text": "(SHENZHEN, China) \u2014 Chinese tech giant Huawei is launching a U.S. court challenge to a law that labels the company a security risk and would limit its access to the American market for telecom equipment.\n\nHuawei Technologies Ltd.\u2019s announcement Thursday comes as the biggest global maker of network equipment for phone and internet companies fights U.S. efforts to persuade allies to exclude the company from next-generation telecom systems.\n\nHuawei said it filed a lawsuit asking a federal court in Plano, Texas, to throw out a portion of this year\u2019s U.S. military appropriations act that bars the government and its contractors from using Huawei equipment.\n\nHuawei, China\u2019s first global tech brand, is at the center of U.S.-Chinese tensions over technology competition and cyber-spying. The company has spent years trying to put to rest accusations it facilitates Chinese spying or is controlled by the ruling Communist Party.\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now\n\n\u201cWe are compelled to take this legal action as a proper and last resort,\u201d the company\u2019s chairman, Guo Ping, said in a statement. \u201cThis ban not only is unlawful, but also restricts Huawei from engaging in fair competition, ultimately harming U.S. consumers.\u201d\n\nHuawei has about 40 percent of the global market for network gear but its U.S. sales evaporated after a congressional panel in 2012 cited the company and a Chinese competitor, ZTE Corp., as security risks and told phone carriers to avoid dealing with them.\n\nHuawei complains U.S. authorities have released no evidence. Washington\u2019s campaign to persuade allies to shun Huawei threatens to block access to major markets as phone carriers prepare to invest billions of dollars in fifth-generation equipment.\n\nHuawei says the new law would shrink its potential U.S. market further by prohibiting the government from buying the Chinese vendor\u2019s technology and from buying goods or services from or giving grants or loans to companies or other third parties that do. The United States accounts for 20 to 25 percent of the global market for computer and telecom technology.\n\nThe company is challenging the U.S. law as an unconstitutional \u201cbill of attainder,\u201d or a measure that targets a specific individual for penalties without a trial. The company says that infringes its due process rights and improperly has Congress play the role of a court.\n\nThe ban is \u201cbased on numerous false, unproven and untested propositions,\u201d said Song Liuping, the company\u2019s chief legal officer, in the statement. \u201cHuawei has an excellent security record and program. No contrary evidence has been offered.\u201d\n\nThe Chinese government has accused Washington of fabricating or exaggerating security concerns to block a successful Chinese competitor.\n\nHuawei, based in Shenzhen, near Hong Kong, is a leading developer of 5G along with rivals Nokia Corp. of Finland and Sweden\u2019s LM Ericsson. Industry analysts say excluding the Chinese vendor from markets for 5G equipment would reduce competition and might lead to higher prices.\n\n\u201cThe restrictions on Huawei will stifle competition, leaving U.S. consumers paying higher prices for inferior products,\u201d said the company statement.\n\nHuawei, founded in 1987 by a former military engineer, overtook Ericsson in 2017 as the biggest global supplier of network gear. It says it supplies 45 of the world\u2019s top 50 phone companies and has contracts with 30 carriers to test 5G wireless technology.\n\nEuropean governments are balking at U.S. pressure to ban Huawei. The company has announced contracts with customers including the United Arab Emirates in the Middle East for network technology.\n\nIn January, U.S. prosecutors filed charges accusing Huawei of stealing trade secrets and its chief financial officer of lying to banks about dealings with Iran.\n\nThe executive, who is the daughter of the company\u2019s founder, was arrested Dec. 1 by Canadian authorities and is fighting a U.S. extradition request.\n\nChina\u2019s government arrested two Canadians, a former diplomat and a businessman, on Dec. 10 in what was widely seen as an attempt to pressure Canada to release the executive, Meng Wanzhou.\n\nOn Monday, the government accused the two men of acting together to steal state secrets. That followed the Canadian government\u2019s announcement Friday that the extradition proceeding would be allowed to continue.\n\nHuawei executives deny wrongdoing and say American security warnings have yet to affect sales outside the United States. The company\u2019s 2018 revenue forecast is $100 billion and its founder, Ren Zhengfei, said last month this year\u2019s target is $125 billion.\n\nSome European officials and others cite a Chinese security law that requires companies to cooperate with intelligence agencies. They say Huawei and other tech companies might be required to install \u201cbackdoors\u201d in equipment to allow eavesdropping.\n\nHuawei denies altering its equipment to facilitate spying and has set up testing centers in Britain, Canada and continental Europe to allow governments to examine its technology.\n\nThursday\u2019s statement called Huawei \u201cthe most open, transparent, and scrutinized company in the world.\u201d\n\nThe company also has launched a public relations campaign abroad. Its typically press-shy founder, Ren, gave a two-hour interview to foreign reporters in January in which he said Huawei would reject Chinese government demands to disclose confidential information about its customers. Since then, Ren also has talked at length with foreign TV broadcasters.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.",

Canada said Friday, March 1, 2019, it will allow the U.S. extradition case against Wanzhou to proceed. She is due in court on March 6, at which time a date for her extradition hearing will be set. Meng is wanted in the U.S. on fraud charges that she misled banks about the company's business dealings in Iran. (Darryl Dyck/The Canadian Press via AP, File)\n\nTORONTO (AP) -- An executive of Chinese tech giant Huawei is suing the Canadian government, its border agency and the national police force, saying they detained, searched and interrogated her before telling her she was under arrest.\n\nLawyers for Meng Wanzhou said Sunday they filed a notice of civil claim in the British Columbia Supreme Court. Canada arrested Meng, the daughter of Huawei's founder, at the request of the U.S. on Dec. 1 at Vancouver's airport. She is wanted on fraud charges that she misled banks about the company's business dealings in Iran.\n\nThe suit alleges that instead of immediately arresting her, authorities interrogated Meng \"under the guise of a routine customs\" examination and used the opportunity to \"compel her to provide evidence and information.\" The suit alleges Canada Border Service Agency agents seized her electronic devices, obtained passwords and unlawfully viewed the contents and intentionally failed to adviser her of the true reasons for her detention. The suit said only after three hours was she told she was under arrest and had right to counsel.\n\n\"This case concerns a deliberate and pre-meditated effort on the part of the defendant officers to obtain evidence and information from the plaintiff in a manner which they knew constituted serious violations of the plaintiff's rights,\" the claim says.\n\nMeng is out on bail and living in Vancouver awaiting extradition proceedings.\n\nOn Friday, Canadian Justice Department officials gave the go-ahead for her extradition proceedings to begin. Meng is due in court Wednesday to set a date for the proceedings to start. It could be several months or even years before her case is resolved.\n\nMeng's arrest set off a diplomatic furor and severely strained Canadian relations with China. Beijing has accused Washington of a politically motivated attempt to hurt the company.\n\nChina detained former Canadian diplomat Michael Kovrig and Canadian entrepreneur Michael Spavor on Dec. 10 in an apparent attempt to pressure Canada to release Meng.\n\nA Chinese court also sentenced a Canadian to death in a sudden retrial, overturning a 15-year prison term handed down earlier. Kovrig and Spavor haven't had access to a lawyer or to their families since being arrested.\n\nNicolas Dorion, a spokesman for the Canada Border Services Agency, said it's not a practice of the agency to comment on legal matters that are before the courts. A justice department spokesman referred comment to the border agency, and a spokesman for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said they were unlikely to comment Sunday.\n\nGary Botting, a Vancouver extradition lawyer who is not representing Meng, said Canada's Border Services Agency tends to overstep.\n\n\"They took her under custody without telling her why,\" Botting said. \"They disguised the real reason why they detained her. Her rights were violated.\"\n\nBotting said they had no reason to detain her as she had travelled to Canada many times before. \"They are trying to get all this information ahead of time and they know ultimately an arrest was in the works,\" he said.\n\nJulian Ku, senior associate dean for academic affairs at Hofstra Law, noted the civil action is separate and apart from Meng's extradition proceeding. He said the lawsuit will allow her to argue she is being unfairly treated and support her broader public relations claim that the detention is part of a U.S and Canadian political conspiracy against Huawei.\n\nLynette Ong, an associate professor of political science at the University of Toronto who focuses on China, quipped that the detained Canadians should take Beijing to court for violation of basic human rights, taking a leaf from the Meng lawsuit.\n\n\"The violation of their human rights is so much more grave than violation of her constitutional rights,\" Ong said. \"But that's not even possible for them. The fact that they were denied a lawyer in the first place means they are not entitled to any justice.\"",

The Department pursues cases free of any political interference and follows the evidence and rule of law in pursuing criminal charges,\u201d spokeswoman Nicole Navas said in an email to Reuters.\n\nHuawei, along with another Chinese network equipment company, ZTE Corp, has been accused by the United States of working at the behest of the Chinese government. The United States has said their equipment could be used to spy on Americans. Huawei has repeatedly denied the claims.\n\nCommenting on the spying concerns, the Huawei founder reiterated that the company will \"never undertake\" any spying activities.\n\nHuawei, the world's biggest producer of telecoms equipment, faces intense scrutiny in the West over its relationship with the Chinese government and allegations of enabling state espionage, with the United States calling for its allies not to use its technology.\n\nRen said the company could downsize to weather such attempts by the United States.\n\n\"The world cannot leave us because we are more advanced. Even if they (U.S.) persuade more countries not to use us temporarily, we can always scale things down a bit\", he added.\n\nIn comments on a potential ban in the UK, Ren said it would not make the company withdraw its UK investments, adding that it will shift its investments to the UK from the United States if U.S. actions against Huawei continue.\n\n\"We will invest even more in the UK. Because if the U.S. doesn't trust us, then we will shift our investment from the U.S. to the UK on an even bigger scale,\" Ken told the BBC.\n\nReuters reported earlier on Monday that British security officials do not support a full ban of Huawei from national telecoms networks despite U.S. allegations against the Chinese firm.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Kanishka Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Dan Grebler)",

    "title": "Trump\u2019s Bizarre Tweet About China and 6G Wireless Tech, Unpacked",
    "description": "Seemingly out of the blue, Donald Trump weighed in on the future of U.S. wireless technology Thursday morning.",
    "text": "6G? Nicholas Kamm/Getty Images\n\nSeemingly out of the blue, Donald Trump weighed in on the future of U.S. wireless technology Thursday morning.\n\nI want 5G, and even 6G, technology in the United States as soon as possible. It is far more powerful, faster, and smarter than the current standard. American companies must step up their efforts, or get left behind. There is no reason that we should be lagging behind on......... \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 21, 2019\n\n....something that is so obviously the future. I want the United States to win through competition, not by blocking out currently more advanced technologies. We must always be the leader in everything we do, especially when it comes to the very exciting world of technology! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 21, 2019\n\nThe reference to 6G tech, which does not actually exist, prompted a lot of jokes about 7-minute abs and razor blades. But, while they may have sounded a bit goofy, Trump\u2019s comments could have significant implications for the administration\u2019s stance toward China. Washington and Beijing officials are resuming trade talks on Thursday (they supposedly have a March 1 deadline for reaching a deal, though it\u2019s unclear how firm that is), and one of the major points of diplomatic tension between the two countries in recent months has been the U.S.\u2019s aggressive pushback against Huawei, the Chinese telecom giant that is a leader in 5G tech, and which American leaders have accused of posing a \u201cnational security threat.\u201d U.S. intelligence officials have worried that China could use Huawei\u2019s hardware to spy on other countries and have urged allies not to adopt it. In December, Canada arrested Huawei\u2019s CFO, Meng Wanzhou, on behalf of U.S. authorities, which are seeking to extradite her. Huawei and Meng, who is the daughter of company founder and CEO Ren Zhenfei, have been indicted stateside on charges of violating sanctions against Iran; the company faces separate criminal charges that it stole trade secrets from T-Mobile. A Huawei employee was also arrested in Poland last month on spying charges.\n\nWith trade talks picking back up this week, CBS News has been airing an interview with Ren, in which the CEO has denied the spying allegations. In a segment that aired this morning, he complained that the U.S. government has \u201cbeen regarding 5G as the technology at the same level of the\u2014some other military equipment. 5G is not an atomic bomb.\u201d\n\nHe later added: \u201cNow we are rolling out 5G and soon we\u2019ll welcome 6G. And in the future, I said there will be new equipment that is suitable for the United States.\u201d Soon is almost certainly an overstatement. China\u2019s government has said it plans to start research on 6G technology next year, with the hope of rolling it out by 2030. But regardless of whether Ren was exaggerating, it seems likely Trump picked up on his comments (otherwise it seems unlikely he\u2019d be talking about a still-imaginary wireless standard). As CNBC notes, by saying he doesn\u2019t want to \u201cblock\u201d more advanced tech from entering the country, the president may be signaling a softening attitude toward Huawei.\n\nTrump has reportedly been preparing an executive order to ban Huawei and ZTE from operating in the U.S., which would grant U.S. companies a little more cushion to build their own 5G networks. Now it seems Trump could be reconsidering a ban on Chinese telecoms.\n\nSo, as the Onion would say, fuck everything, we\u2019re going to 6G.",

    "description": "Ready for more pricey foldable phones? Huawei on Sunday introduced its Mate X, a $2,600 rival to Samsung's Galaxy Fold.",
    "text": "Huawei CEO Richard Yu displays the new Huawei Mate X foldable 5G smartphone at the Mobile World Congress, in Barcelona, Spain, Sunday, Feb. 24, 2019. The fair started with press conferences on Sunday, before the doors open on Monday, Feb. 25, and runs until Feb. 28. (Photo: Manu Fernandez, AP)\n\nBARCELONA, Spain (AP) \u2014 China's Huawei unveiled a new folding-screen phone on Sunday, joining the latest trend for bendable devices as it challenges the global smartphone market's dominant players, Apple and Samsung.\n\nHuawei revealed its Mate X phone on the eve of MWC Barcelona, a four-day showcase of mobile devices, as the company battles U.S. allegations it is a cybersecurity risk.\n\nThe device can be used on superfast next-generation mobile networks that are due to come online in the coming years.\n\nDevice makers are looking to folding screens as the industry's next big thing to help them break out of an innovation malaise, although most analysts think the market is limited, at least in the early days.\n\nThe Mate X is the answer to a question Huawei faced as it sought to satisfy smartphone users' demands for bigger screens and longer battery life, said Richard Yu, CEO of its consumer business group.\n\n\"How can we bring the more big innovation to this smartphone industry?\" Yu said at a glitzy media launch.\n\nThe Mate X will sell for 2,299 euros ($2,600) when it goes on sale by midyear. That's even more than Samsung's recently revealed Galaxy Fold, priced at nearly $2,000.\n\nMore: Galaxy Fold: As Galaxy S turns 10, Samsung looks to future with first foldable phone\n\nMore MWC: LG's V50 ThinQ 5G will be Sprint's first 5G phone this spring\n\nThe Mate X's screen wraps around the outside so users can still view it when it's closed, unlike the Galaxy Fold, which has a screen that folds shut. Unfolded, the Mate X's screen is 8 inches diagonally, making it the size of a small tablet.\n\nYu said Huawei engineers spent three years working on the device's hinge, which doesn't leave a gap when shut.\n\nRichard Yu, CEO of Huawei Consumer Business Group, presents the new Mate X mobile at the Mobile World Congress 2019 (MWC19), in Barcelona, Spain, 24 February 2019. The latest developments in mobile technologies are presented at the MWC19 from 25 to 28 February. EPA-EFE/Andreu Dalmau ORG XMIT: GRAF3034 (Photo: Andreu Dalmau, EPA-EFE)\n\n\"No matter how innovative and technology-advanced the new device is, it will take a lot more time for a critical mass of consumers to experience the benefits of foldable phones and 5G technology,\" Forrester analyst Thomas Husson said. Huawei still \"has to find its own brand voice to differentiate from Samsung and Apple and stop acting as a technology challenger.\"\n\nHuawei Technologies is trying to raise its profile in the fiercely competitive smartphone market. Almost everyone with a smartphone has heard of Apple and Samsung, the top device makers, and Google, the power behind Android's pervasive software.\n\nHuawei, a Chinese company with a name many people in the West don't know how to pronounce (it's \"HWA-way\"), wants to join the market's upper echelon.\n\nIt's getting close. Samsung was the No. 1 smartphone seller for all of last year, followed by Apple, according to research firm International Data Corp. Huawei came third, though in some quarters it took second place, IDC data showed.\n\nThe company stealthily became an industry star by plowing into new markets, honing its technology, and developing a line-up of phones that offer affordable options for low-income households and luxury models that are siphoning upper-crust sales from Apple and Samsung in China and Europe.\n\nBut Huawei's products are few and far between in the U.S. The scarcity stems from long-running security concerns that the company could facilitate digital espionage on behalf of China's government. Washington has been lobbying European allies to keep its equipment out of new 5G networks.\n\nMore: Trump tweets that he wants 5G and 6G networks in the U.S. 'as soon as possible'\n\nMore: Are you ready to spend $2,000 for Samsung's new Galaxy Fold phone?\n\nThe cloud over Huawei also includes U.S. criminal charges filed last month against the company and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, who U.S. prosecutors want to extradite from Canada. They accuse her of fraud and say the company stole trade secrets, including technology that mobile carrier T-Mobile used to test smartphones.\n\nHuawei is making its push at a time that both Samsung and Apple are struggling with declining smartphone sales amid a lull in industry innovation that is causing more consumers to hold on to the devices until they wear out instead of upgrading to the latest model as quickly as they once did.\n\nThe company sells high-priced smartphones as well as an extensive range of cheaper models priced from $200 to $600 that offer a good camera and other features most consumers want, analysts said.\n\nBut Huawei wouldn't be where it is today if it had been content focusing merely on China and other Asian markets.\n\nThe company took a huge step forward several years ago when it began pouring millions into promoting its brand and building partnerships in major European markets such as Germany, France, Britain, Spain and Italy. Research firm Gartner estimates it now sells about 13 percent of its phones in Europe.\n\nAs for the U.S., Huawei can only make so much headway as long as the government is casting the company as a cyber-villain, said Gartner analyst Tuong Nguyen.\n\n\"Brand building is a long-term exercise, but it's going to be especially difficult in the U.S. because of the way they have branded all of China,\" he said. \"The barriers in the U.S. are just getting more difficult.\"\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/02/24/chinas-huawei-unveils-5g-phone-with-folding-screen/39107565/",

    "description": "Huawei has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government, claiming that its efforts to block the Chinese company from selling telecom equipment to federal agencies is unconstitutional. The lawsuit was issued in Texas, where Huawei's U.S. headquarters is based.",
    "text": "Share\n\nHuawei has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government, claiming that its efforts to block the Chinese company from selling telecom equipment to federal agencies and other parties is unconstitutional. Huawei made the announcement at a press conference in Shenzhen, and executives read their prepared statements off of Huawei\u2019s Mate X foldable smartphone.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in Plano, Texas, where Huawei\u2019s U.S. headquarters is based. The U.S. government has alleged for some time that the Chinese government could use Huawei\u2019s telecommunications equipment to spy on U.S. networks, which is why it has gone so far as to persuade other governments to ban Huawei products. It has even disrupted a potential deal between Huawei and AT&T in 2018, where the carrier would sell the Chinese company\u2019s smartphones. Huawei has repeatedly denied these allegations, and an executive at the press conference said the company \u201chas not and will never implant any backdoors.\u201d\n\nHuawei\u2019s biggest complaint is that the U.S. government has \u201cnever provided any evidence that Huawei poses a cyber security threat.\u201d The company said it was left with no choice but to issue the lawsuit, which focuses on a provision in the National Defense Authorization Act. The provision specifically bans government agencies from purchasing telecommunications equipment from not just Huawei, but also ZTE. If you recall, ZTE was banned from the U.S. for most of 2018, but the ban has since lifted and it\u2019s able to work with U.S. suppliers again.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department recently accused Huawei of stealing trade secrets, and also accused the company of doing business with Iran despite U.S. sanctions. These charges were made in an effort to extradite Meng Wanzhou, Huawei\u2019s chief financial officer, who was arrested and detained in Canada back in December. A hearing is set to take place on May 8 to determine whether Wanzhou will face charges in the U.S.\n\nHuawei has slowly been trying to repair its image in the U.S. \u2014 it placed full-page ads in the Wall Street Journal last week titled, \u201cDon\u2019t believe everything you hear.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am writing to you in the hopes that we can come to understand each other better,\u201d Catherine Chen. director of the board at Huawei, wrote in the open letter. \u201cIn recent years, the US government has developed some misunderstandings about us. We would like to draw your attention to the facts.\u201d\n\nThe letter goes on to mention the 170 countries and regions Huawei operates in, the company\u2019s history, and the types of services it provides. Huawei is ramping up its deployment of its 5G telecommunication equipment, and one of its complaints is its inability to provide its products, including 5G, to U.S. consumers.\n\n\u201cThis ban not only is unlawful, but also restricts Huawei from engaging in fair competition, ultimately harming U.S. consumers,\u201d Guo Ping, Huawei rotating chairman, said in a press release. \u201cWe look forward to the court\u2019s verdict, and trust that it will benefit both Huawei and the American people.\u201d",

Interviews on the UK's BBC and American broadcaster CBS soon followed.\n\nIn the CCTV segment, Zhengfei shrugged off the global push against his company and hinted at the rationale behind the media push.\n\n\"My public relations department forced me,\" a smiling Ren told CCTV. \"I must make our clients understand us, make our 180,000 employees understand us, come together and get through this tough time.\"\n\nThe United States warns that next-generation 5G equipment, which some telecoms experts see as more vulnerable to attack than previous technology, could be exploited by the Chinese government for spying if supplied by Huawei.\n\nHuawei has denied the claims, even as American officials have tried to persuade governments and telecoms operators around the world to shun Huawei equipment.\n\n\"I think it's more being transparent. It's time to take control of our narrative,\" Skinner said, who noted that Huawei buys $11 billion in U.S. goods every year.\n\nThe move comes as the United States is seeking the extradition from Canada of Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer and Ren's 47-year-old daughter, after charging her with bank and wire fraud related to violation of U.S. sanctions against Iran.\n\nIn interviews earlier this month, Ren said her arrest was politically motivated and that the company had never shared any customer information with the Chinese government, and never would.\n\n\n\n\n\n(Reporting by Diane Bartz and Alexandra Alper; Editing by Sandra Maler)",

Pat Shanahan, the recently installed acting secretary of defense, said he has no orders to reduce the U.S. troop presence, although officials say that is at the top of the Taliban's list of demands in exploratory peace negotiations. Shanahan said he is encouraged that President Donald Trump's administration is exploring all possibilities for ending a 17-year war, the longest in American history. But he stressed that peace terms are for the Afghans to decide.\n\nKUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) \u2014 Former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak is hardly lying low ahead of his corruption trial on charges related to the multibillion-dollar looting of the 1MDB state investment fund. He's crooned about slander in an R&B video and vilified the current government in daily social media posts to counter portrayals of him as corrupt and out of touch. The trial set to begin Tuesday comes nine months after Najib's spectacular election defeat, which was spurred by voters' furor over the 1MDB scandal that is being investigated in the U.S. and other countries. He is charged with 42 counts of criminal breach of trust, graft, abuse of power and money laundering in one of Malaysia's biggest criminal trials.\n\nSEOUL, South Korea (AP) \u2014 When President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un first met in Singapore last year, there was pomp, there was circumstance, but there wasn't much substance. Before they meet again in Vietnam on Feb. 27-28, there's growing pressure that they forge a deal that puts them closer to ending the North Korean nuclear weapons threat. But what could that look like? Kim may be willing to dismantle his main nuclear complex. The U.S. may be willing to cough up concessions, maybe remove some sanctions. The question, however, is whether what's on offer will be enough for the other side.\n\nCANBERRA, Australia (AP) \u2014 Australia's prime minister has cast his government as stronger on national security than the opposition after signing an agreement with the French government to deliver a fleet of submarines and ahead of federal elections expected to be held in May. Prime Minister Scott Morrison used a speech to Australia's National Press Club on Monday on the eve of Parliament's first sitting day of the year to detail his conservative coalition's record on a range of security issues including military spending, terrorism, asylum seekers, criminals using encrypted communications and domestic violence. Earlier, Morrison and French Defense Minister Florence Parly signed an agreement of deliver the first of a fleet of 12 submarines to Australia in the early 2030s.\n\nWELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) \u2014 About 3,000 people who fled as a wildfire threatened a New Zealand town were allowed to return home Monday as firefighting conditions improved. Another 400 residents living in valleys near the fire aren't yet able to return, although officials hope they will be able to soon. Firefighters say they've gained the upper hand over the blaze thanks to favorable weather conditions. The forest fire began nearly a week ago on the South Island and burned 2,300 hectares (5,700 acres). It burned down one house and prompted evacuations beginning Friday. \"It's a large fire, and the fact that we're able to get residents back into Wakefield this afternoon is extremely positive news,\" said Civil Defence Minister Kris Faafoi.\n\nBEIJING (AP) \u2014 A look at recent developments in the South China Sea, where China is pitted against smaller neighbors in multiple disputes over islands, coral reefs and lagoons in waters crucial for global commerce and rich in fish and potential oil and gas reserves: ___ EDITOR'S NOTE: This is a weekly look at the latest developments in the South China Sea, the location of several territorial conflicts that have raised tensions in the region. ___ CHINA RESPONDS TO PHILIPPINE DEVELOPMENT ON THITU ISLAND Ships from the Chinese navy and coast guard along with fishing boats from its maritime militia have been deployed to keep watch on Philippine development work on the island of Thitu.\n\nBEIJING (AP) \u2014 The U.S. Embassy in Beijing says it is following the case of a Chinese-born Kazakh man who had been fighting attempts by Beijing to return him to China from neighboring Uzbekistan and whose current whereabouts are unknown.

    "text": "Chinese smartphone and communications equipment manufacturer Huawei on Thursday local time followed through with threats to sue the U.S. government over legislation that bars government agencies from buying its products.\n\n\n\nIn a complaint filed with a U.S. district court in Texas, Huawei claims elements of 2018's U.S. National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) ( PDF link ) that limit government agency spending are unconstitutional. Specifically, section 889 of NDAA, entitled \"Prohibition on certain telecommunications and video surveillance services,\" restricts executive government agencies from purchasing telecommunications equipment manufactured by Huawei and ZTE.As noted by CNBC, Huawei claims the NDAA provision is a \"bill of attainder,\" or a legislative act that declares a person or persons guilty of an act and punishes them without due process. Such legislation is deemed unconstitutional.Further, by codifying a prohibition under NDAA, the U.S. government is depriving Huawei of due process, disallowing it of hearing charges or fighting those allegations in court.Section 889 was born from government allegations of espionage on the part of Huawei and ZTE. Despite Huawei's consistent denial of those claims, the U.S. has sought not only to rid official agencies of the company's hardware, but impress security concerns on consumers.\"The U.S. Congress has repeatedly failed to produce any evidence to support its restrictions on Huawei products,\" Huawei Rotating Chairman Gu Ping said in a statement , reports Reuters.Separately, Huawei, company CFO Wanzhou Meng and \"unofficial affiliate\" Skycom are facing U.S. Department of Justice charges for bank fraud, wire fraud, violations of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) and conspiracy to commit money laundering.Prosecutors allege Huawei conducted business operations in Iran through Skycom in violation of U.S. sanctions on the country and subsequently lied about banking partnerships tied to the endeavor. Charges also include allegations that Huawei personnel stole trade secrets relating to a T-Mobile robot called \"Tappy.\" The company is also charged with obstruction for allegedly moving witnesses beyond U.S. reach and attempting to destroy or conceal evidence from investigators.",

    "description": "With international intrigue and a 5G coming-out party, this show doesn\u2019t need the boost of a Samsung event.",
    "text": "CNET\n\nSamsung and the MWC Barcelona conference have long had an up-and-down relationship. The energy at the trade show has ebbed and flowed depending on whether the world's largest handset maker decides to hold its big first-half phone launch in Spain. If Samsung shows up, there's a noticeable perk in interest.\n\nOn Wednesday, just days before this year's MWC kicks off, Samsung debuted its Galaxy S10 lineup and its Galaxy Fold. In San Francisco.\n\nYou'd think this would take the wind out of the MWC sails. But between the mix of unique new devices, some international intrigue and, of course, 5G, the show has a good shot of standing on its own without Samsung. MWC traditionally offers you a window into what the smartphone world will look like over the next year. But with 5G, you could be seeing the foundation for how things evolve over the next few years.\n\nNow playing: Watch this: MWC 2019 phone trends we'll see\n\n\"This will be the most consequential MWC since the launch of 4G,\" said Wayne Lam, an analyst at HIS Markit.\n\nWhere CES in January offered a modest tease of what 5G would look like, MWC will be the proper launch of the next-generation cellular technology. After years of hype that 5G will change our lives by connecting everything to a super-fast and super-responsive network, some of the deployments are actually going live.\n\nHeck, even President Donald Trump is tweeting about it.\n\nAnother reason to be excited is the potential to see more foldable smartphones in the works. Samsung may have kicked things off with the Galaxy Fold, but Huawei and Xiaomi may have their own flexible devices. LG, likewise, has an intriguing second-screen attachment for one of its flagship phones.\n\nThe other wrinkle is how Huawei will handle being in the spotlight at the show while dealing with increased global scrutiny over the security of its products. The company typically has a massive presence at MWC, and this year won't be any different.\n\nSo yeah, it's going to be a wild and weird show.\n\n5G, 5G, 5G\n\nIt's 2019, and 5G is finally here. South Korea has switched on the service, although customers and deployments remain limited. In the US, AT&T has real 5G (not the fake 5G E) in a dozen markets, while Verizon has had its 5G Home service up since late last year (some quibble about whether it's real 5G).\n\nCNET\n\nThere's no question we'll see slivers of real 5G deployments throughout the conference, with big-name companies like Huawei, Ericsson and Nokia likely putting up test networks in the Fira Gran Via Convention Center.\n\nIt'll be a good field test of these networks, given the sheer foot traffic and competing cellular demands of so many different deployments.\n\nMWC will also be a good place to see the broader applications beyond a faster smartphone connection. Ericsson in the past has shown how a responsive network can help you remotely drive an excavator thousands of miles away, while Huawei has shown off the potential for smart cities.\n\n\"The mobile industry is moving forward at rapid pace, and we expect the most significant theme of MWC Barcelona to be how 5G will change the world, and in particular the role it will play in ushering in a new era of intelligent connectivity,\" said Mats Granryd, director general of the GSMA, the trade group that puts on the show.\n\nNot just Samsung\n\nThe Galaxy Fold stole the thunder away from the Galaxy S10 at Samsung Unpacked. Foldable phones at MWC could do the same.\n\nWhile Samsung has gotten the jump on the competition, companies like Huawei and Xiaomi could have the last laugh.\n\nCNET\n\nWhile the Galaxy Fold wowed audiences with its demo, Samsung opted not to let anyone get too close to it, and the phone was MIA when the demo area opened up. Another company could steal the spotlight by offering people a closer hands-on with their foldable devices.\n\nAt CES, I tried out the Flexpai from Chinese startup Royole. While the software was buggy, the folding display did work well, and it was easily one of the more impressive things I saw at the show. The point is, the bar is low and tolerance for work-in-progress products is high when it comes to flexible phones.\n\nCNET reported that TCL is working on a family of foldable devices, and could offer a tease at the show too.\n\nRead: Mate X: Huawei's $2,600 foldable phone steps up to Galaxy Fold with three screens, four rear cameras, 5G\n\nInternational intrigue\n\nIt's not all fun and games. One of the undercurrents of the show will be how Huawei deals with the questions over its conduct. The US has led the crusade against the company, with its Justice Department leveling numerous charges, including intellectual theft, fraud and obstruction of justice.\n\nMeng Wanzhou, the company's chief financial officer and daughter of founder Ren Zhangfei, is incarcerated in Canada awaiting extradition to the US on some of the charges laid out by the Justice Department. Huawei has denied any wrongdoing, and Ren said in an interview with CBS This Morning that the move was politically motivated. (Note: CNET and CBS This Morning are both part of CBS.)\n\nHuawei\n\nLikewise, ZTE will be coming back from the brink after a settlement with the US Commerce Department over sanctions related to its work with North Korea and Iran. It kept a low profile at CES 2019, but is expected to back with a press conference in Barcelona.\n\nWild-card devices?\n\nIn the last few years at MWC, phones have emerged out of nowhere to captivate showgoers.\n\nThere's the mysterious LG smartphone with a second-screen attachment. It's not exactly a foldable smartphone, but it's a potentially unique innovation that gets us past the boring rectangular slab.\n\nAndrew Hoyle/CNET\n\nBack in 2017, startup HMD Global, which makes phones using the Nokia brand, caught a lot of attention with its remake of the Nokia 3310, which perfectly tapped into the nostalgia trend that also saw the revival of the NES Classic.\n\nHMD did it again last year with the Nokia 8110, also known as the Matrix phone. Leaks point to a phone with an astounding five cameras on the back.\n\nNokia 9 PureView \"Beholder.\" HNY pic.twitter.com/x4Kh3anP46 \u2014 Evan Blass (@evleaks) December 31, 2018\n\n\n\nPerhaps it'll go for a trifecta of retro phones. Or someone like Chinese phone maker Oppo will come out of nowhere to wow crowds.\n\nWith Samsung out of the mix, anything could happen at MWC.\n\nThe story originally published at 5 a.m. PT.",

    "text": "Equipment made by Chinese electronics giant Huawei could be torn out of America's electrical grid, if US senators get their way.\n\nThe bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee today recommended Uncle Sam's Department of Energy and Department of Homeland Security move to keep Huawei hardware out of the Land of the Free's power networks.\n\nSpecifically, the legislators said, they want both agencies to bar utilities from purchasing and installing a specific family of network-connected inverter Huawei produces for solar power grids. These inverters convert DC electricity from the panels into AC for the grid, and can be controlled remotely to manage solar arrays.\n\nThe senators reason that if Huawei can not be trusted to supply computer gear for communications systems, they should not be supplying vital electronics for new solar plants. The committee members fear Beijing will instruct Huawei to backdoor its products allowing Chinese spies to silently snoop on Western targets from afar. Huawei insists it is not compromising its kit for its Communist overlords.\n\n\"Huawei has recently become the world\u2019s largest maker of inverters \u2013 the sophisticated control systems that have allowed the rapid expansion of residential and utility scale energy production,\" the committee says in its letter (PDF) to DOE boss Rick Perry and DHS head Kirstjen Nielsen. \"Both large-scale photovoltaic systems and those used by homeowners, school districts, and businesses are equally vulnerable to cyberattacks.\n\n\"Our federal government should consider a ban on the use of Huawei inverters in the United States and work with state and local regulators to raise awareness and mitigate potential threats.\"\n\nYou're on a Huawei to Hell, US Sec State Pompeo warns allies: Buy Beijing's boxes, no more intelligence for you READ MORE\n\nAmong the high-ranking senators signing off on the letter are Mitt Romney (R-UT), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), Tom Cotton (R-AR), and Little Marco Rubio (R-FL). Senators Cotton and Marco had previously spearheaded successful efforts to get Huawei products barred.\n\nHuawei already faces a blanket ban on its wireless and networking gear in US government networks, as the administration believes the Chinese will use the hardware to spy on private and public-sector organizations. The US government has since 2018 said that it would not provide federal assistance funds to any phone company that uses Huawei gear, a move that effectively bars Huawei equipment most large carriers in the nation.\n\nAt the same time, the Feds have charged Huawei chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou with illegally breaking sanctions against Iran, and are trying to extradite her from Canada to America. Wanzhou, daughter of the corporation's founder Ren Zhengfei, and Huawei itself deny those charges, and the allegations it works with the Chinese government to spy on foreign entities. \u00ae",

Huawei denies this, though, we note it can be compelled by its communist masters to assist China's spies in political and industrial espionage. Of course, Western nations also have their own laws that can force folks to cooperate with cops and g-men.\n\nHuawei's 54-page complaint can be found here [PDF]. In it, the manufacturer's USA wing, based in Plano, Texas, names various government department heads, from Education Secretary Betsy DeVos to Veteran Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie, as well as the United States itself, as defendants. It focuses on Section 889 in particular, alleging:\n\nSection 889 violates at least three constitutional provisions: It violates the Bill of Attainder Clause by singling out Huawei for punishment\u2014blacklisting it, impugning both its general reputation and its specific commitment to honoring the laws of the United States, and denying it any procedure through which it can clear its name and escape sanction. Section 889 also violates the Due Process Clause by selectively depriving Huawei of its liberty \u2014 severely curtailing its freedom to do business, stigmatizing it by effectively branding it a tool of the Chinese government and a risk to U.S. security, and denying it any pre-deprivation legal process to confront the congressional charges against it. And section 889 violates the Vesting Clauses and the resulting separation of powers by legislatively adjudicating Huawei to be \u201cguilty\u201d of an alleged connection to the Chinese government, and by implication a threat to U.S. security, rather than leaving it to the Executive and the courts to make and adjudicate any such charges.\n\nAs well as an injunction, the biz is also seeking any relief the court sees fit to award, including the costs of its legal bills. The White House had no comment in response to the lawsuit as we went to press.\n\n\"The US Congress has repeatedly failed to produce any evidence to support its restrictions on Huawei products,\" said the goliath's chairman Guo Ping in a statement. \"We are compelled to take this legal action as a proper and last resort. This ban not only is unlawful, but also restricts Huawei from engaging in fair competition.\"\n\nHuawei opens Brussels code-check office: Hey! EU've got our guide \u2013 love Huawei READ MORE\n\nEarlier this month, Huawei pleaded not guilty in New York to charges of conspiracy to steal trade secrets, attempted theft of trade secrets, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice, in the US, all of which is regarding the disappearance of a Tappy robotic phone testing system belonging to T-Mobile USA.\n\nMeanwhile, Huawei and its CFO Meng Wanzhou are, separately, accused by US prosecutors of conspiracy and committing fraud arising from alleged sanction-busting business dealings with Iran. Both deny any wrongdoing.\n\nAnd on top of all this, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo earlier warned that Uncle Sam will no longer provide top-secret intelligence to countries that use Huawei equipment in their core networks, out of fear the hush-hush info could leak through backdoored boxes to Beijing.\n\nSome nations, such as Germany, are happy to continue using Huawei's kit. The Chinese giant is working through a laundry list of security concerns Britain's cyber-spies found in its communications gear, and remains locked out of Blighty's sensitive networks for now. Australia, Japan, and New Zealand have rejected or warned against using Huawei 5G network gear to one degree or another.\n\nEven if Huawei, which claims its technology is superior to Western competitors, manages to get its ban in the US scrapped by the courts, we imagine there will be at least some hesitation among government IT buyers to reach for the Chinese corp's sales catalog and put in an order during the aftermath. Which, of course, may have been the goal all along by elements within the US government: to send a message, at home and abroad, that the Chinese are not to be trusted.\n\nLaw experts watching the case reckon Huawei doesn't stand much chance of winning its battle, though. And if you don't believe them, just ask Kaspersky Lab.\n\nFinally, the irony of an organization in China demanding a fair hearing is not lost on us. \u00ae",

    "text": "Chinese hardware maker Huawei pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy to steal trade secrets, attempted theft of trade secrets, wire fraud, and obstruction of justice, in the US on Thursday.\n\nThe arraignment of China-based Huawei Device Co, Ltd and and its US subsidiary Huawei Device USA Inc before a Seattle federal district court this week follows the filing of a criminal indictment in Janaury that alleged the electronics giant tried to steal the technology behind T-Mobile USA's Tappy robotic phone testing system, and then obstructed justice when T-Mob threatened to sue.\n\nThat indictment [PDF] describes how a Huawei employee repeatedly entered a T-Mobile USA lab to gather data on Tappy, and at one point took the robot's arm home, concealed in a bag, to photograph it. When T-Mob employees discovered the arm was missing, the Huawei staffer initially denied knowledge of the missing arm then later claimed he found it in his bag.\n\nConcerned about legal consequences, at least according to the criminal court filing, Huawei produced an internal report on the incident that characterized the misdeeds as the work of rogue employees, rather than a formal policy that encouraged corporate theft. According to the prosecution's complaint, though, Huawei China \"established a formal schedule for rewarding employees for stealing information from competitors based on the confidential value of the information obtained.\"\n\nT-Mobile USA sued Huawei in 2014 over the shenanigans, and in 2017, a jury found the Chinese networking and smartphone goliath guilty of trade secret theft, and awarded $4.8m in damages. The US government's criminal case, filed earlier this year, stems from that civil legal action. The criminal charges were submitted at the same time Huawei, two related companies, and CFO Meng Wanzhou were indicted in New York on fraud and conspiracy charges arising from alleged sanction-busting business dealings with Iran.\n\nMeng, daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, was arrested in Canada in December at the request of the US authorities, which later formally demanded her extradition to America to face the aforementioned fraud and conspiracy charges. Canadian authorities are expected to decide on Friday whether they will begin extradition proceedings against Meng. Huawei and Meng deny any wrongdoing.\n\nTrade war hots up\n\nThe case against the Chinese telecom box maker reflects heightened tensions between the US and China over ongoing trade talks and news reports have suggested charges against Meng may be dropped if China offers a deal that suits the Trump administration.\n\nUS politicians last year claimed that Huawei's products represent a security threat, based on its belief the biz may be forced by Beijing to install backdoor that would allow China to spy on the West's network traffic, a concern raised frequently by US defense and intelligence agencies since at least 2011. Other countries have similar concerns about US telecom gear.\n\nGermany tells America to verpissen off over Huawei 5G cyber-Sicherheitsbedenken READ MORE\n\nRecently, lawmakers have begun taking action on those concerns. The FY2019 National Defense Authorization Act lists five Chinese companies the US Defense Department should avoid \u2013 Huawei Technologies Company, ZTE Corporation, Hytera Communications Corporation, Hangzhou Technology Company, and Dahua Technology Company.\n\nUS lawmakers are considering the Defending U.S. Government Communications Act, which would prohibit Huawei kit at not just defense and intelligence agencies but all of them. The US has also been urging allies to stay away from Huawei networking equipment.\n\nSo far Australia, Japan and New Zealand have rejected or warned against Huawei 5G network gear to one degree or another. Britain, Canada, Germany and Italy are said to be considering similar moves, though recent reports suggest Britain and Germany aren't likely to follow through.\n\nHuawei's trial is scheduled to begin March 2, 2020. \u00ae",

Reports are coming in that the Chinese OEM is preparing to file a lawsuit against the government that continues to campaign against using any of their products as they believe Huawei works closely with the Chinese government and are therefore allegedly spying on citizens and the U.S. government itself. The US has also encouraged its allies to do the same.\n\nAccording to a report from The New York Times, they have two sources that are saying that Huawei is preparing the lawsuit against the U.S. government and it will be filed in the Eastern District of Texas where their American headquarters are located. The details about the suit are unknown at this time but of course it has to do with the government\u2019s concentrated campaign against the company on the basis that they are a security threat.\n\nThe source says that the lawsuit will be challenging the defense spending authorization law that has stopped executive agencies from using equipment from Huawei and another Chinese company, ZTE.

They cannot create a legislative act that singles out a person or company without first having a trial.\n\nWhile Huawei has continually denied allegations that they are being used by China to spy on American citizens and its government, the pressure has definitely worked as major companies like AT&T and Verizon have stopped using equipment manufactured by the Chinese OEM. They have even urged their allies to ban Huawei products, even as the company is preparing for their major role in the construction of next-generation wireless networks globally.

In it, the federal government barred itself from using products made by Huawei as well as another Chinese hardware maker, ZTE.\n\nLook for Huawei to argue that such a provision is a \u201cbill of attainder,\u201d something the Constitution doesn\u2019t allow Congress to pass. A bill of attainder is any legislation that singles out a person or entity for a punitive measure outside of a trial.\n\nThat defense legislation is one example among many that we and others have been reporting about for months, as tension between the US and Huawei keeps ratcheting up. Complicating things is the fact that this matter is also a kind of proxy fight between the US and China, where it\u2019s assumed Huawei has close ties to the government there \u2014 the government also being a central target of the Trump administration over trade issues.\n\nWord of Huawei apparently poised to sue the US government comes as the company\u2019s embattled CFO Meng Wanzhou has also actually gone ahead and filed a lawsuit in Canada against the government there, as well as its border agency and national police.

To no avail, it seems.\n\nIn the weeks after her arrest, US law enforcement officials in January unveiled a series of criminal charges against Huawei that include allegations of bank fraud and the alleged theft of US company trade secrets.\n\nIt should be noted that, according to the NYT, Huawei\u2019s plans related to a lawsuit aren\u2019t necessarily set in stone.

[Politico / Alexander Panetta]\n\nWilson-Raybould provided notes from phone calls and meetings in which Trudeau and his aides tried to convince her that prosecuting the company would threaten Canadian jobs \u2014 and important votes.

[BBC]\n\nOn top of it all, China is using the SNC-Lavalin case to talk about Canada\u2019s arrest of Meng Wanzhou, CFO of the mobile giant Huawei. Trudeau claims Wanzhou was arrested in compliance with an extradition treaty with the US and his country won\u2019t interfere in the case. On Friday, a Chinese Communist Party spokesperson was asked if it were hypocritical that Trudeau would interfere with the SNC-Lavalin case but deny getting involved in the Huawei case. The spokesperson replied that attention was on the precedent Canada would set. [Washington Post / Emily Rauhala]\n\nNow Trudeau\u2019s prime ministership faces a rocky future. Wilson-Raybould was demoted after the SNC-Lavalin situation, and she later quit the cabinet. Trudeau admitted that he asked the former AG to protect the company but said he didn\u2019t pressure her.

The suit also targets the Canada Border Services Agency and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.\n\nGovernment spokespeople declined to comment directly on the lawsuit.\n\n\u201cCanada is conducting a fair, unbiased, and transparent legal proceeding with respect to the arrest of Ms. Meng Wanzhou,\u201d said Scott Bardsley, a spokesperson for the Public Safety ministry, in an email.\n\nOttawa's extradition decision came despite mounting pressure from China, which has included the detention of several Canadian citizens and a foreign ministry spokesperson questioning the credibility of the North American nation's government on Friday.\n\nThe pressure hasn't let up.\n\n\"China strongly opposes Canada's insistence to proceed with the so-called extradition of Ms. Meng Wanzhou, and it has made a solemn representation,\" the ministry said in a statement released on Saturday morning. \"It is a serious political incident. We again urge the U.S. to rescind its request for the extradition of Ms. Meng and call for Canada to release her immediately.\"\n\nMeng, a daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, is due back in court in British Columbia on Wednesday.\n\nCanadian officials conducted a \"thorough and diligent review of the evidence\" and determined it was sufficient to present the case to a judge for extradition, the Canadian Justice Department said Friday. The move does not reflect a judgment that Meng is either guilty or innocent, the government said.\n\nThe issue could come up directly between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping when they meet later this month in an ongoing trade negotiations.\n\nIan Young from the South China Morning Post contributed to this report.",

Meng is the daughter of Huawei's founder, Ren Zhengfei.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nCanadian officials conducted a \"thorough and diligent review of the evidence\" and determined it was sufficient to present the case to a judge for extradition, the Canadian Justice Department said in a news release. The move does not reflect a judgment that Meng is either guilty or innocent, the government said.\n\nThe case has stoked tensions among the U.S., Canada and China since Meng was arrested in December during a layover at Vancouver's international airport. The Canadian government's decision to move forward with the extradition process injects new drama into the U.S.-China trade talks at a time when the Trump administration is trying to wrap up negotiations on a deal.\n\n\u201cWe are disappointed that the Minister of Justice has decided to issue an Authority to Proceed in the face of the political nature of the U.S. charges and where the President of the United States has repeatedly stated that he would interfere in Ms. Meng\u2019s case if he thought it would assist the U.S negotiations with China over a trade deal,\u201d David Martin, who leads Meng's defense team, said in a statement.\n\nMorning Tech Technology news from Washington and Silicon Valley \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox. Email Sign Up By signing up you agree to receive email newsletters or alerts from POLITICO. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nMartin was referring to President Donald Trump's Feb. 22 suggestion that the Huawei charges could become a bargaining chip in the U.S.-China negotiations, sparking fears among national security hawks in Congress that he could set aside cybersecurity threats to advance his trade agenda. Trump's chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, tried to walk back Trump's comments a day later, though the president's ultimate strategy remains unclear.\n\nThe South China Morning Post reported last month that a senior adviser to the Chinese Communist Party predicted that the Huawei charges would become part of the trade talks and that Meng would be released in the coming months.\n\nMartin also contends the extradition proceedings the Canadian government authorized is rooted in part in charges that would not be considered criminal in Canada \u2014 which would violate the country's extradition agreement with the U.S.\n\n\u201cOur client maintains that she is innocent of any wrongdoing and that the U.S. prosecution and extradition constitutes an abuse of the processes of law,\" he said.\n\nMeng is due back in court on March 6. Justice William Ehrcke of the Supreme Court of British Columbia previously released her on $7.5 million bail and required that she remain in Vancouver, where she owns two multimillion-dollar homes, while her case wends its way through Canadian courts.\n\nIn late January, the U.S. Justice Department charged Meng and Huawei with deceiving international banks about a Huawei subsidiary's operations in Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions, along with related financial crimes. Huawei itself was also charged with wire fraud and stealing intellectual property from U.S. wireless provider T-Mobile starting in 2012; the company pleaded not guilty to those crimes in a federal court in Seattle on Thursday.\n\nThe Meng case has put Canadian officials in a precarious spot, given that China is an increasingly important trading partner.\n\nAs the legal situation has unfolded, the Canadian government has tried to keep a neutral stance. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau fired the country\u2019s ambassador to China in January for repeatedly commenting on the case in public, including suggesting that Meng has a strong argument against extradition.\n\nMeanwhile, China has been ratcheting up political pressure on Canada. Multiple Canadian citizens have been detained in China since Meng's arrest and senior government officials have demanded her immediate release. Ren, the Huawei founder, told CBS News in a rare interview on Feb. 20 that his daughter's arrest was \"politically motivated.\"\n\nAt a press briefing Friday in Beijing, a Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman hit at the Trudeau government's credibility, noting that the prime minister faces political peril within Canada over reports his administration pressured government lawyers to drop corruption charges against SNC-Lavalin, a construction company headquartered in his hometown. Some have used the case to question the country's judicial independence and whether the law is evenly applied to foreign and domestic companies.\n\n\u201cI believe fair-minded people can tell right from wrong,\u201d spokesman Lu Kang said. \u201cIn fact, it is not only the Chinese and Canadian people, but also people from all around the world that are very interested to see what the Canadian government is going to say about this.\u201d\n\nHuawei is the world\u2019s largest producer of telecommunications equipment and the second-largest maker of smartphones \u2014 but U.S. officials have grown increasingly concerned that its technology could be used to spy for the Chinese government.\n\nThe U.S. has been urging its allies to restrict their use of Huawei technology, especially when building out next-generation 5G networks. Already, countries as varied as Japan, Australia and the U.K. have expressed doubts about the company. In January, Poland arrested a Huawei sales director on espionage charges.\n\nWendy Wu at the South China Morning Post contributed to this report.\n\n",

Meng, the daughter of Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei, is residing in Vancouver while the Canadian government decides whether to authorize her extradition to the U.S.\n\nThe prospect of the U.S. retreating on Huawei drew swift pushback from lawmakers of both parties who have repeatedly warned the company could be used as a spying tool for the Chinese government. Huawei is the world's largest provider of telecommunications equipment, and U.S. officials have been crossing the globe warning other countries to steer clear of Huawei and another Chinese telecom firm, ZTE.\n\nMorning Tech Technology news from Washington and Silicon Valley \u2014 weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Mark Warner (D-Va.).\n\nThis isn't the first time Trump has used penalties on a Chinese company as a tool to advance his trade agenda. Last year, the administration lifted a ban on ZTE for violating sanctions against Iran, after Trump said he and Chinese President Xi Jinping wanted a solution.\n\n\"President Xi of China, and I, are working together to give massive Chinese phone company, ZTE, a way to get back into business, fast. Too many jobs in China lost. Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done!\" Trump tweeted in May.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats criticized the administration's decision on ZTE, saying it put Trump's trade agenda above national security concerns. But Trump has touted the deal to lift the ban on ZTE in return for the company paying a $1 billion fine and replacing its management team.\n\nThe Trump administration has separately been considering an executive order that would impose harsh penalties on Huawei, POLITICO and other media outlets have reported, but the president said Friday that he would prefer not to block Chinese companies from the U.S. market.\n\n\"I want competition with China, fair competition. I don't want to block out anybody if we can help it,\" Trump said. \"Now, if there's going to be a security reason or something that we have no choice. But that is one of the things we'll be discussing today. We want to have open competition. We've always done very well in open competition.\"\n\nCanada's relationship with China, a key trading partner, has been poisoned by Meng's arrest. Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei called it \"politically motivated,\" and the Chinese government has pressured Canada to release her immediately.\n\nA senior adviser to the Chinese Communist Party predicted this week that Meng's arrest could be linked to the trade talks and that she could be released from house arrest as early as April, the South China Morning Post reported.\n\nJohn Hendel and Alex Panetta contributed to this report.",

Emoticons started appearing in court in 2004, and they have since been found most commonly in sexual predation cases.

The new branch will be overseen by an Air Force undersecretary for space, and it will be structured in a similar way as the Marine Corps, which is a component of the US Department of the Navy, but has its own Joint Chiefs of Staff representation.

City officials have said the rule\u2019s creation will help reduce road congestion, and de Blasio\u2019s office said Uber and other ride-hailing companies have made traffic worse. The lawsuit reflects the increasingly combative relationship between NYC and global technology companies: Two weeks ago, Lyft sued the city\u2019s transportation commission over the implementation of minimum pay rules for drivers; last week, Amazon walked away from plans to build a sprawling new headquarters in Queens to support 25,000 employees; and Airbnb and other home-rental companies are fighting the city in court over its demand that they turn over renter data.

Meng and Huawei face US charges of conspiring to violate US sanctions on Iran.\n\n\"Today, Department of Justice Canada officials issued an authority to proceed, formally commencing an extradition process in the case of Ms Meng Wanzhou,\" the government said in a statement on Friday. \"The department is satisfied that ... there is sufficient evidence to be put before an extradition judge for decision.\"\n\nLegal experts had predicted Ottawa would give the go-ahead, given the close judicial relationship between Canada and the United States.\n\nIt could be years though before she is ever sent to the US, since Canada's slow-moving justice system allows many decisions to be appealed.\n\nDavid Martin, Meng's lawyer, said in a statement, \"We are disappointed that the Minister of Justice has decided to issue an Authority to Proceed in the face of the political nature of the US charges and where the President of the United States has repeatedly stated that he would interfere in Ms Meng's case if he thought it would assist the US negotiations with China over a trade deal.\"\n\nCanada-China relations\n\n190219044409758\n\nThe decision is likely to sour Canada's already bad relations with China, which is demanding Meng be released.\n\n\"The Chinese side is utterly dissatisfied,\" China's embassy in Ottawa said in a statement. \"This is not a merely judicial case, but a political persecution against a Chinese high-tech enterprise. The subsequent developments have proved this. The so-called 'rule of law' and 'judicial independence' asserted by Canada cannot cover up the mistakes made by the Canadian side on the case of Meng Wanzhou.\"\n\nAfter her detention, China arrested two Canadians on national security grounds, and a Chinese court later sentenced to death a Canadian man who previously had only been jailed for drug smuggling.\n\nCanadian Justice Minister David Lametti declined to comment.\n\nUS President Donald Trump told Reuters news agency in December he would intervene if it served national security interests or helped close a trade deal with China, prompting Ottawa to stress the extradition process should not be politicised.
