    "text": "Image: HP\n\nEven though the government shutdown ended more than a month and a half ago, we\u2019re still feeling its effects. That\u2019s because, despite HP issuing an expansion for a battery recall back in January, the notice wasn\u2019t posted to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) website until earlier this week due to the shutdown.\n\nHP\u2019s latest battery woes actually stem back to a recall covering 50,000 affected units first issued in January 2018, which was then expanded earlier this year to include another 78,500 or so at-risk systems and battery accessories. Meanwhile, on the most recent recall alert posted by the CPSC on March 12th, a note at the top of the CPSC website says \u201cThis recall expansion was previously announced independently on January 17, 2019 by the firm due to US government furlough.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHP\u2019s laptop battery recall primarily affects a number of the company\u2019s commercial notebooks including various HP ProBooks and HP ZBook workstations, though there are a few consumer laptops mixed in there such as the 11-inch HP Pavilion x360 and HP Envy m6. Some recalled batteries were also sold as accessories or replacement batteries for existing laptops for systems such as the HP Envy 15 and assorted HP Mobile Thin Clients.\n\nSo far, the CPSC says HP has received eight new reports of these faulty battery overheating, melting, and charring, with one instance of a recalled battery causing minor injury.\n\nConsumers with laptop batteries who think they might be subject to recall are asked to go to this website and download HP\u2019s Battery Validation tool to check if their battery needs to be replaced, as some of the systems affected by the recall have internal batteries that are not user replaceable.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHP says it is also trying to proactively notify customers, and if a battery is determined to be part of the recall, HP says owners should stop using the system immediately and put the system in Battery Safety Mode via HP\u2019s BIOS update. From there HP will provide free battery replacement for affected units.\n\nScreenshot: HP\n\nTo see a full list of recalled products and accessory batteries, check out the list above or visit HP\u2019s recall page here. Hopefully the next time a big recall pops up, instead of having workers sitting on their hands caused by political posturing, the government can make sure its workers are available to help get the word out.\n\n",

    "title": "Boeing\u2019s fixes to 737 MAX software delayed by government shutdown, report claims",
    "description": "Change to software due \"by April,\" says Boeing\u2014but could it have come sooner?",
    "text": "Update: President Donald Trump announced Wednesday afternoon that the Federal Aviation Administration will order all 737 MAX 8 and 737 MAX 9 planes to be grounded.\n\n\"We\u2019re going to be issuing an emergency order of prohibition to ground all flights of the 737 Max 8 and the 737 Max 9 and planes associated with that line,\" Trump said. \"Pilots have been notified, airlines have been all notified. Airlines are agreeing with this. The safety of the American people and all people is our paramount concern.\"\n\nFaced with widespread bans on the aircraft, Boeing has recommended the 737 MAX be grounded as well. \"We are supporting this proactive step out of an abundance of caution,\" Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg said in a statement. \"Safety is a core value at Boeing for as long as we have been building airplanes; and it always will be. There is no greater priority for our company and our industry. We are doing everything we can to understand the cause of the accidents in partnership with the investigators, deploy safety enhancements and help ensure this does not happen again.\"\n\nOriginal story: Despite two crashes within six months, a growing number of grounding orders worldwide for the Boeing 737 MAX, and a number of recent complaints from US pilots over problems with the aircraft's automatic trim controls, the Federal Aviation Administration continues to allow the 737 MAX to fly. \"The United States Federal Aviation Administration is not mandating any further action at this time, and based on the information currently available, we do not have any basis to issue new guidance to operators,\" a Boeing spokesperson said in a March 12 statement.\n\nBut government inaction may have been at least partially to blame for the crash of an Ethiopian Airlines 737 MAX on March 10\u2014the US government shutdown reportedly pushed back a fix to the aircraft's software for more than a month.\n\nOn March 11, Boeing announced that the company \"has been developing a flight control software enhancement for the 737 MAX, designed to make an already safe aircraft even safer.\" The shutdown of non-essential operations at the FAA caused work on the fix to be suspended for five weeks, according to unnamed US officials cited by the Wall Street Journal. The fix is expected to be mandated for installation by the FAA by the end of April.\n\nThe update seeks to correct what may have been the root cause of the crash of Lion Air Flight 610 in Indonesia last October\u2014the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System's (MCAS') reliance on a single sensor to determine whether the aircraft is entering a stall. But according to a WSJ report, that fix was delayed because the FAA shutdown interrupted the approval process.\n\n\"We don\u2019t have any comment on claims in the WSJ\u2019s story,\" a Boeing spokesperson told Ars.\n\nA stall occurs when an aircraft's angle of attack (AOA)\u2014the relative angle of the aircraft's wing surfaces to the flow of air across them\u2014reaches the point where the wing can no longer generate enough lift to sustain flight. Usually, this happens in a climb with insufficient air speed. Automatic control systems such as MCAS try to solve this problem by pushing the nose of the aircraft down\u2014putting the aircraft into a descent and increasing airspeed and relative airflow across the wings. MCAS relies on an AOA sensor to determine whether this is required. If the AOA sensor is faulty, it could create a false signal of a stall\u2014which is what happened in the case of Lion Air Flight 610 and may have been the issue with the Ethiopian Airlines flight.\n\nThe MCAS software update includes a new \"enhanced flight control law,\" a Boeing spokesperson said, which \"incorporates [AOA] inputs, limits stabilizer trim commands in response to an erroneous angle of attack reading, and provides a limit to the stabilizer command in order to retain elevator authority.\"\n\nIn other words, it uses multiple sensor inputs to determine whether adjustments to the flight controls are necessary, giving the pilot direct control over the tail control surfaces to override any automatic adjustments. Currently, the pilot would have to entirely disable automatic stabilizer trim to counteract \"stabilizer trim runaway\" in the event of a sensor error.\n\nGo home, 737 MAX\u2026\n\nOn March 13, the European Union's civil aviation authorities joined China, Australia, Singapore, Ethiopia, Malaysia, the United Kingdom, and a number of Latin American air carriers in grounding Boeing 737 MAX aircraft after the crash of the Ethiopian Airlines flight just after take-off on March 10. As the EU imposed its grounding, a number of 737 MAX aircraft were forced to turn around in flight because they were no longer considered airworthy at their destinations.\n\nThis poor guy got turned around. pic.twitter.com/M7MZ5bK32n \u2014 Outdated Ineffective Wall (@darthbender) March 12, 2019\n\nToday, Canada's transportation minister announced a grounding of all 737 MAX aircraft in Canada and a ban on the incursion of 737 MAX aircraft from other countries into Canadian airspace. The decision, Minister Marc Garneau said, was based on new satellite tracking data reviewed by Canadian aviation authorities.\n\nMeanwhile, Boeing continues to stand behind the safety of the aircraft. \"We understand that regulatory agencies and customers have made decisions that they believe are most appropriate for their home markets,\" a Boeing spokesperson said. \"We\u2019ll continue to engage with them to ensure they have the information needed to have confidence in operating their fleets.\"\n\nThose concerns may not be addressed until the software patch for MCAS is pushed out.",

    "text": "This is an excerpt from a story delivered exclusively to Business Insider Intelligence E-Commerce Briefing subscribers. To receive the full story plus other insights each morning, click here.\n\nUS retail sales totaled $504.4 billion in January 2019, according to a report from the US Census Bureau. This is up .2% from last December's performance and 2.3% year-over-year (YoY).\n\nBusiness Insider Intelligence\n\nThese improvements are particularly important following retail's poor performance in December 2018 \u2014 when it had the biggest drop on a month-to-month basis since 2009 \u2014 as they indicate that the industry may avoid a prolonged slide.\n\nA number of retail segments recovered, with e-commerce coming in as one of the top performers. After growing only 2% YoY in December, nonstore retailers' sales, which includes e-commerce, rose 7.3% YoY, giving it the second highest YoY growth in January behind building material's 8.7% YoY jump.\n\nOther segments like food and beverage stores, health and personal care stores, and the group including sporting goods stores saw higher annual sales growth in January than in December. Having a number of areas perform well could mean that retail as a whole is trending in the right direction, but segments including furniture and apparel and clothing accessory stores saw worse YoY growth in January than they did in December, so there's still reason for concern.\n\nA revision of December's performance suggests that its sales growth was worse than originally thought, making January's results that much more important.The US Census Bureau originally reported that December's sales saw a 1.2% drop from November and a 2.3% increase YoY, but its newly released report puts December's month-to-month sales growth at -1.6% and its YoY growth at just 1.6%.\n\nThis means that retailers may be hurting more than originally thought, especially those that rely on holiday sales to bolster their full-year performances.\n\nJanuary could be the beginning of a positive trend in US retail in 2019 \u2014 something it desperately needs since it's off to a rough start.Retailers have already announced plans to close over 4,300 stores in 2019. Meanwhile, the year kicked off with the government shutdown and the US-China trade war is ongoing \u2014 and both impact retail's performance.\n\nIf January is the first of many months of improved sales and consumer spending, retailers may be able to weather these issues, but if not, store closures, retail bankruptcies, and other issues could pile up throughout 2019.\n\nInterested in getting the full story?

    "description": "By the time you read this, I hope you\u2019ve at least received your far-delayed tax return due to the US government shut down. But no matter who blinked first to end the shutdown (or possibly start it again), chances are another self-inflicted crisis will likely \u2026",
    "text": "By the time you read this, I hope US government workers have at least received their far-delayed pay owed to them for their work during the government shutdown. But no matter who blinked first to end the shutdown (or possibly start it again), chances are another self-inflicted crisis will likely happen between now and 2020 because Washington politicians don\u2019t remember how to work together.\n\nThis is no way to run a \u201csuperpower.\u201d Americans are pissed off nationwide, and despite the president\u2019s insistence that America is respected again, confidence in American leadership has plummeted worldwide. Even so, the US will likely survive its embarrassing inability to conduct the business of government \u2014 it\u2019s too big to fail.\n\nWe desperately need to remember Patrick Henry\u2019s declaration, \u201cUnited we stand, divided we fall.\u201d What if factions within a company reflected the political parties\u2019 disagreement on what constitutes reality and utter lack of ability to collaborate? That would be no way to run a company. Unity is as important in business as it is in government, maybe even more so. Most businesses aren\u2019t too big to fail.\n\nWhat color is the sky in your world?\n\nIf people can\u2019t agree on the set of facts surrounding an issue, they can\u2019t come up with solutions. This proves true in Washington where competing truth bubbles run rampant as politicians try to gin up support with spin. As a nation, we\u2019ve slowly built up a tolerance for lies.\n\nBut now the falsehoods are streaming out of Washington at a fire-hose volume, and we\u2019ve reached a crisis point. At the end of the year, The Washington Post noted that President Trump averaged 15 lies a day in 2018 \u2014 nearly triple the 2017 average. Today, the credibility gap yawns wider than ever before, and it makes solving problems almost impossible.\n\nUnfortunately, \u201cfake news\u201d isn\u2019t just a political phenomenon \u2013 it\u2019s a problem in company boardrooms and leadership meetings too. And just as politicians often cite misleading statistics to make their case, business leaders are frequently guilty of cherry-picking \u201cfacts\u201d that put their department in the best light and cast blame on others.\n\nThe culprit? Incomplete data or numbers taken out of context. Say a marketing team needs to generate 1,000 qualified leads so sales can close 50 deals. The company comes up short in its sales goals, but marketing cites numbers from its martech stack that show it held up its end of the bargain. Then the sales team makes a quick return with competing data from its customer relationship management (CRM) system which supports the sales team\u2019s claim that \u201cmarketing\u2019s leads were garbage.\u201d Who are we to believe?\n\nThe underlying problem in this scenario is that there\u2019s no shared reality, no credible data set that is shared across the entire organization. To solve the \u201cfake news\u201d problem, companies should put all their sales and marketing data in their CRM system. Otherwise, they\u2019ll continue to base actions on competing versions of reality. And as we\u2019ve seen from Washington, that way lies madness \u2014 and dysfunction.\n\n\u201cStronger together\u201d is more than a political slogan\n\nNo matter if you\u2019re a Democrat, Republican, or otherwise identified, history clearly demonstrates that when people work together, they can achieve more than they can separately. In a rare show of bipartisan unity, Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate worked together to pass the First Step Act, a crime bill designed to reduce recidivism and reform federal criminal justice operations \u2014 a bill Mr. Trump signed into law late last year.\n\nThe overwhelming support for the bill shows what political factions can do when they stop lying to us and each other, come together around a common purpose, and collaborate to solve problems. Unfortunately, that bill\u2019s passage was an anomaly; the parties remain divided, and resulted in the longest government shutdown in history. The same is true in too many businesses, where departments work at cross-purposes \u2014 and lose opportunities due to lack of collaboration.\n\nBuilding a \u201cstronger together\u201d culture starts with understanding each other\u2019s different points of view as well as your shared mission. In Washington, too often legislators put party politics over their common duty of conducting the people\u2019s business. In business, department leaders often point fingers to absolve themselves of blame instead of collaborating to solve problems and focusing on their true goal of creating value for the company.\n\n\u201cBlame-casting\u201d might work in the short term \u2014 the boss might buy one team\u2019s explanation and hold another group responsible for a setback. But is that really what\u2019s important? Do we come to work to polish our image in the boss\u2019s eyes, or are we there to add value by generating revenue and achieving business objectives? For most professional adults, it\u2019s the latter, and to truly move the needle and accomplish a business goal, collaboration is a must.\n\nIn our marketing and sales example, it\u2019s critical for the two teams to come together and clearly define what a qualified lead looks like and exactly how it is generated. The two teams need to understand and respect each other\u2019s place in the value-creation chain and agree on a set of metrics that indicate progress as well as a data source that is credible to everyone. Then they can work together like adults instead of feuding like middle-schoolers \u2014 or politicians.\n\nGuard against factionalism\n\nThe political divisions in the US are real. Divided companies tend to split along fault lines that reflect genuine differences of opinions too. But true collaboration is defined by bringing together different perspectives so you shouldn\u2019t expect an era of kumbaya. If new and different ideas are flowing, a debate \u2014 even a heated one \u2014 on how to achieve objectives is possible, even if everyone in the organization agrees on a single source of data reality and fully commits to collaboration.\n\nThe necessary element in both government and business is a shared sense of purpose and goals. Competing visions on how to achieve those objectives are inevitable, but factionalism is a choice. The gridlock in Washington reflects a slide into factionalism \u2014 one anticipated by George Washington and John Adams when they warned of the dangers of a two-party system.\n\nThe American democratic experiment is being tested now. Many companies are dealing with a similar stress test for parallel reasons. The good news is that we get to choose our path every day. If your company has fallen into factionalism, there\u2019s still time to stop \u2014 do a reality check, recognize your common goals, and work together to achieve them. If our feuding political parties can\u2019t set a good example, at least they serve as a cautionary tale. It won\u2019t be easy but it\u2019s necessary, because in your business, failure shouldn\u2019t be an option.",

    "text": "Since Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was elected to Congress, she's brought a refreshing and powerfully passionate energy to Washington, DC.\n\nWhen she isn't mastering the art of the Twitter takedown, sharing her social media skills with fellow Democrats, or answering interview questions as candidly as possible, the 29-year-old is making insightful speeches that effectively communicate her personal beliefs and challenge the American people to rethink our power structures and national priorities.\n\nWhether she's at a protest or on the House floor, Ocasio-Cortez never shies away from expressing her opinions, no matter how bold. She delivers her messages calmly and succinctly, and though she's only been on the job for a few months, she's already made several memorable \u2014 and quotable \u2014 speeches.\n\nFrom thanking her supporters on the night she was elected to her stirring defense of the Green New Deal, here are seven Ocasio-Cortez speeches so good you'll want to binge watch them whenever you need to be inspired.\n\n1. Her victory speech\n\nThe 29-year-old representing New York's 14th Congressional District became the youngest woman to ever be elected to Congress, and after she was elected in November 2018, she gave an impassioned victory speech.\n\nOcasio-Cortez recalled the many obstacles she overcame throughout her life to get to that podium and thanked her supporters, encouraging them and promising she would fight to change the world for the better.\n\n2. The first speech she made on the House floor\n\nDuring President Trump's government shutdown, which lasted 35 days \u2014 the longest in America's history \u2014 Ocasio-Cortez made her first speech on the House floor.\n\n\"The truth of this shutdown is that it's actually not about a wall, it is not about the border, and it is certainly not about the well-being of everyday Americans. The truth is, this shutdown is about the erosion of American democracy and the subversion of our most basic governmental norms,\" she said during her time at the mic.\n\nOcasio-Cortez's speech reportedly broke a C-SPAN streaming record on Twitter by racking up 1.16 million views in a little over 12 hours \u2014 the most views a video of any member of the House has ever received. Quite the debut, AOC.\n\n3. Her comments at the 2019 Women's March\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at the Women's March in New York: \"Justice is about making sure that being polite is not the same thing as being quiet. In fact, often times, the most righteous thing you can do is shake the table.\" https://t.co/knzLXDTwND pic.twitter.com/oXcsyrGb2S \u2014 CNN (@CNN) January 19, 2019\n\nOcasio-Cortez attended the 2019 Women's March in New York City wearing her iconic red lipstick and gold hoop earrings, where she made a powerful speech about justice, equality, and the environment.\n\n\"Justice is about making sure that being polite is not the same thing as being quiet. In fact, often times, the most righteous thing you can do is shake the table,\" she poetically preached to an enthusiastic audience.\n\n4. When she took on Big Pharma\n\nAOC has made several speeches before House committees, but she drew a lot of attention in February when she asked in-depth questions about Big Pharma and public investment return on the development of drugs.\n\n5. The time she exposed America's broken campaign finance system\n\nAnother noteworthy speech took place when Ocasio-Cortez played a five-minute, lightning round \"Corruption Game\" with members of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform, who held a hearing about H.R. 1., known as For the People Act of 2019.\n\n\"I'll be the bad guy,\" Ocasio-Cortez said, before proceeding to ask a series of questions that successfully exposed how incredibly problematic and \"fundamentally broken\" America's campaign finance system is.\n\nAt one point, she asked if she and all other Americans are being held to a higher ethical standard than the president, to which Walter Shaub, Campaign Legal Center's senior director of ethics, replied, \"That's right...\"\n\n6. Her hopeful inaugural address\n\nOcasio-Cortez returned home to the Bronx to deliver a nearly 20-minute inaugural address in February. In the hopeful speech she outlined her political agenda, highlighting topics like immigration, Amazon, her Green New Deal, and more.\n\n7. Her defense of the Green New Deal\n\nWatch every second of this... @AOC is so incredibly spot on. pic.twitter.com/ESP4dC5TTo \u2014 Brian Tyler Cohen (@briantylercohen) March 27, 2019\n\nAOC recently defended the Green New Deal to the Senate after the plan was rejected by a vote of of 57-0. In response to concern that the deal is \"elitist,\" Ocasio-Cortez outlined why a general concern over climate and environment impacts each and every person on this planet.\n\n\"This is not an elitist issue, this is a quality of life issue,\" the Congresswoman said. \"You want to tell people that their concern and their desire for clean air and clean water is elitist? Tell that to the kids in the south Bronx, which are suffering from the highest rates of childhood asthma in the country.\"\n\n\"Tell that to the families in Flint whose kids have their blood ascending in lead levels, their brains are damaged for the rest of their lives. Call them elitist.\"\n\nHow one even attempts to recover after being hit with a such a high caliber response is beyond me. Following the speech, as the video above made the rounds online, AOC received a whole lot of Twitter praise.\n\nOcasio-Cortez has been captivating rooms long before she joined Congress \u2014 as you can see by this 2011 speech she made at Boston University \u2014 and she's an expert at reaching wide audiences on Twitter and Instagram Live. We have no doubt she'll deliver plenty more meaningful, moving messages during her time in Congress and beyond. We eagerly await future speeches, and will continue to update this article with the best of the best.",

    "description": "The Federal Aviation Administration and an inspector general will signal changes to aviation safety oversight in the wake of two fatal Boeing 737 MAX 8 crashes, according to prepared testimony obtained by CNN for a highly anticipated congressional hearing.",
    "text": "(CNN) The Federal Aviation Administration and an inspector general will signal changes to aviation safety oversight in the wake of two fatal Boeing 737 MAX 8 crashes, according to prepared testimony obtained by CNN for a highly anticipated congressional hearing.\n\nDan Elwell, the acting FAA administrator, will tell members of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation's Subcommittee on Aviation and Space Wednesday afternoon that the agency's \"oversight approach needs to evolve,\" although he will say the processes used to certify the 737 MAX were \"extensive, well-established, and have consistently produced safe aircraft designs for decades.\"\n\nHe will defend the FAA's initial decision not to ground the 737 MAX fleet, even as other regulators worldwide did so, saying the agency was not seeing \"systemic performance issues\" with the plane but that it acted three days later when it received \"new information\" from investigators.\n\nElwell will testify alongside Transportation Department Inspector General Calvin Scovel, an agency watchdog, and National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Robert Sumwalt, whose independent federal board investigates incidents and makes recommendations to the FAA and others with regulatory authority. The FAA is part of the Transportation Department.\n\nThe inspector general said changes are coming this summer to a program that allows aircraft manufacturers to sign off on their own work in the FAA's name.\n\n\"By July 2019, FAA plans to introduce a new process that represents a significant change in its oversight approach,\" Scovel's testimony reads. \"For example, FAA's new process will include identifying system elements and developing new evaluation criteria.\"\n\nA spokesman for the FAA declined to comment on or provide details about the changes.\n\nElwell's testimony describes the program -- Organization Designation Authorization -- as \"critical to the success and effectiveness of the certification process\" and mandated by Congress to help manage the FAA's hefty and complex workload.\n\nScovel's testimony summarizes inspector general concerns with the program dating to 2011.\n\n\"Our work over the years on the ODA program has identified management weaknesses with a number of FAA's oversight processes,\" Scovel's testimony reads. \"To its credit, the Agency has taken action to improve its oversight in response to our recommendations.\"\n\nScovel confirms the inspector general's office is probing the 737 MAX certification in response to multiple requests, and Sumwalt's testimony says the NTSB is reviewing \"the US design certification process to ensure any deficiencies are captured and addressed.\"\n\nBoeing officials will be \"carefully monitoring\" the hearing from DC-area offices in Arlington, Virginia.\n\n\"Boeing continues to support the ongoing accident investigations, and is working with the authorities to evaluate new information as it becomes available,\" the company said in a statement. \"Safety is our top priority when we design, build, deliver and maintain Boeing aircraft. Boeing has worked with the FAA, DOT, NTSB, pilots and airline customers as well as other aviation community partners for decades to make flying the world's safest mode of transportation.\"\n\nThe witnesses reveal little about the ongoing investigations of the October Lion Air crash and the Ethiopian Airlines crash earlier this month, which are being conducted by other countries' safety boards with assistance from the NTSB and Boeing. The FAA called the two incidents similar when it grounded the 737 MAX fleet, and investigators are probing a stabilization system that appears to have driven the nose of the Lion Air plane down while the pilots tried repeatedly to pull the plane up.\n\nElwell's testimony reveals that Boeing submitted a proposal to change the system's software to the FAA on January 21, long before the Ethiopian crash and while the FAA and other government agencies were largely closed because of a funding impasse between Congress and the White House. Elwell told reporters earlier this month that the software change had not been delayed by the shutdown.\n\nHe also said the 737 MAX certification involved 297 flight tests, including flights that assessed the stabilization system, the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System.\n\nThe shutdown did impact the NTSB's work investigating the Lion Air crash, Sumwalt reveals. He notes that investigators were furloughed due to the government shutdown but \"NTSB recalled four investigators from furlough ... to assist with proper transcription\" of the cockpit voice recorder, which was recovered in mid-January.",

It was Trump who made the declaration that the US would also ground the plane.\n\nAmid all the news surrounding air travel this week after the Ethiopian Airlines disaster, the country still has no administrator for its top air-safety agency, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).\n\nRead more: Boeing's software update to the 737 Max 8 was reportedly delayed more than a month because of the government shutdown\n\nMichael Huerta, the agency's former administrator that was appointed by President Barack Obama and confirmed by the Senate in June 2013, left the post in January 2018. Since then, Daniel Elwell, the FAA's deputy administrator, has served as acting administrator.\n\nTrump, who has previously bragged about keeping key cabinet posts empty, at one point touted the idea of nominating his personal pilot John Dunkin to lead the FAA. According to Axios at the time, Dunkin rose to the top of the pile after he told Trump there would be fewer delays on the tarmac if a pilot ran the FAA.\n\nThe White House declined a request for comment.\n\nThe FAA is tasked with providing \"the safest, most efficient aerospace system in the world,\" according to its website. The agency is expected to receive $73 billion of the federal government's budget for 2019 and has more than 30,000 employees.",

    "title": "HP recalls more laptops for 'fire and burn hazards' - CNET",
    "description": "We didn't know earlier because of the government shutdown.",
    "text": "Josh Miller/CNET\n\nThe US Product and Safety Commission on Tuesday announced a \"battery safety\" recall of about 78,500 HP laptops for what the UPSC calls \"fire and burn hazards.\"\n\nHP requested we emphasize that it's recalling the batteries, not the laptops. Given that most batteries are nonremovable by end users, it amounts to the same thing on your end -- you still have to ship your laptop off somewhere. However, it does mean that the company replaces the battery, not the entire laptop, so the distinction matters a lot to them. (Like cars getting recalled for faulty airbags.)\n\nHP initiated the recall in January 2018, and expanded it in January 2019, but the news hadn't widely circulated because of the US government shutdown. The UPSC finally posted the news to its site on Tuesday with the explanation, \"NOTE: This recall expansion was previously announced independently on Jan. 17, 2019 by the firm due to US government furlough.\" (We spotted it via Tom's Hardware.)\n\nThis is part of a continuing series of battery recalls from HP. The Jan. 17 recall was for about 51,000 models, but 41,000 were recalled in June 2016 and 100,000 in January 2017, bringing the total for the past two-and-a-half years to almost a quarter of a million.\n\nThe recall applies to laptops sold between April 2015 and December 2018. Per HP:\n\nBatteries affected by this program may have been shipped with specific HP Probook 64x (G2 and G3), HP ProBook 65x (G2 and G3), HP ProBook 4xx G4 (430, 440, 450, 455, and 470), HP x360 310 G2, HP ENVY M6, HP Pavilion x360, HP 11 notebook computers and HP ZBook (17 G3, 17 G4, and Studio G3) mobile workstations sold worldwide from December 2015 through April 2018. They were also sold as accessories or provided as replacements from December 2015 through December 2018 for the above products, as well as additional products through HP or an authorized HP Service Provider, including certain HP Mobile Thin Client products.\n\nHP also warns, \"It is essential to recheck your battery, even if you did so previously and were informed that it was not affected. However if you have already received a replacement battery, you are not affected by this expansion.\"\n\nIf you suspect your laptop qualifies -- it doesn't apply to every model sold within that period -- you can download the validation utility from the recall page to check.\n\nUpdated 1:30 p.m. ET: Added clarification from HP.",

    "text": "Rick Wilking/Reuters\n\nConsumer sentiment rose by more than expected to 97.8 in the first half of March.\n\nIncreasing optimism was concentrated among lower- and middle-class households.\n\nThe gains come after disappointing sentiment readings at the beginning of 2019.\n\nPublic confidence in the economy rose by more than expected in the US in early March, particularly among lower- and middle-class households.\n\nConsumer sentiment rose 4.3% from a month earlier to 97.8, preliminary results from the University of Michigan\u2019s monthly survey showed Friday, compared with economist expectations for a 95.6 reading. Final results are scheduled to be released at the end of the month.\n\nLower- and middle-class Americans were more optimistic toward income potential, pulling the index higher. Overall sentiment jumped among households with incomes in the bottom two-thirds of the distribution, while the top income bracket's confidence in the economy rose at a much slower pace.\n\n\"Since households with incomes in the top third account for more than half of all consumer expenditures, cautious observers will conclude that the latest data are another indication that the end of the expansion is on the distant horizon,\" said Richard Curtin, the survey's chief economist.\n\nAll income groups were more positive about growth prospects for the overall economy \u2014 a rebound following weaker-than-expected consumer sentiment reports in recent months.\n\nFinancial-market turmoil at the end of 2018, fading stimulus, and the partial government shutdown that ended in January have weighed on outlooks toward the economy. Sentiment in February made a modest recovery after falling to its lowest level since October 2016 a month earlier.\n\nBut consumers appear to have shaken off some of these strains, according to Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, with expectations for the future rising to just off the September high.\n\n\"This matters, because it strongly supports our view that the slowing in consumption in recent months is more likely to be a transition to a sustainable pace, as the kick from tax cuts and lower gas prices fades, rather than the start of a sustained downtrend, ultimately leading to the end of the cycle,\" he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, data showed optimism among small businesses rebounded last month after also falling to a more than two-year low.\n\n\"Small-business owners are thankful to have the government shutdown in the rear-view mirror but need more certainty about the future,\" said Juanita Duggan, the NFIB's president and CEO.",

    "text": "lenetstan/Shutterstock\n\nThe initial-public-offering market suffered through a slow start to the year because of the partial government shutdown and the brutal fourth quarter for financial markets, but public debuts are ratcheting back up.\n\nWhile a host of high-profile unicorns and decacorns like Lyft, Uber, Airbnb, and Slack are set to debut on the public market this year, so far healthcare has dominated the US IPO slate.\n\nIt's still early to compare this year's performance to prior years', but so far healthcare is the most active sector to debut on US exchanges in 2019, according to Renaissance Capital.\n\nThe group's showing in the first quarter suggests a strong year ahead for biotech and healthcare, some analysts say.\n\nInvestors in private and public companies know there's a massive slate of highly anticipated initial public offerings coming this year.\n\nHigh-profile technology and transportation unicorns and decacorns like Lyft, Uber, Slack, and Pinterest are all set to debut on the public markets in the coming months after a sleepy first quarter. A host of others, like Airbnb and Peleton, have also reportedly explored going public.\n\nAnd even after a slow start to IPOs this year \u2014 in part because of the partial government shutdown and one of the worst fourth quarters on record \u2014 an overshadowed corner of the market is enjoying a strong run: healthcare.\n\nThe sector is the most active to debut in the US public market so far in 2019, followed by financials, according to data from Renaissance Capital. Healthcare is also the most active over the past year.\n\nInvestors' excitement around newly public biotechnology companies suggests a strong year ahead after healthcare outperformed the broader US IPO market in 2018, the Oppenheimer analysts Jay Olson and Silvan T\u00fcrkcan said.\n\nWhile it's still too early to compare, initial IPO returns in the biotech space are positive this year. They've averaged 2% in about one month compared with 2018 IPOs returning 4% for the whole year, according to their analysis.\n\nSo far this year, 11 biotech IPOs have raised a combined $1.2 billion. Notably, those IPOs in 2019 have been predominantly in the cancer-immunotherapy space, according to Oppenheimer's analysis. The largest so far is Gossamer Bio, which raised $317 million.\n\n\"In discussions with investors, we have received favorable feedback and continued interest in 2019 Biotech IPOs,\" they wrote.\n\nRead more: The market for biotech IPOs is red hot \u2014 here are the top 10 of 2018\n\nThe relatively high number of healthcare companies entering the market isn't just confined to the US. Globally, healthcare and technology were the most active sectors in the first quarter, according to Ernst & Young data.\n\nBetween January and March, there were 45 IPOs in the technology space \u2014 the most of any sector \u2014 followed by the 32 in the healthcare sector.\n\nSo where is all this excitement coming from, and is it a sign of a group that's overheating?\n\nPut simply, and while trying not to sound \"clich\u00e9,\" the Stifel biotechnology analyst Paul Matteis says there's a widespread perception that science around drug development is improving and investors want to get in on advances in different areas like gene therapy, neuroscience, and oncology.\n\n\"It's still early days for leveraging some of the newer tools, like gene therapy and RNAi, that have emerged as vehicles to leverage science that's improving across an array of disease areas,\" Matteis told Markets Insider on Thursday, adding that companies felt as if they had better access to capital.\n\n\"There's been this expansion of tools to tackle and target specific genes,\" he said.\n\nStill, Matteis doesn't think investor sentiment is near the uber-bullish heights of 2015. Between 2014 and 2015, investors saw a relatively high 50 to 60 biotech IPOs a year, according to Oppenheimer's analysis.\n\nThe Nasdaq Biotechnology Index is up just over 13% this year, barely outperforming the S&P 500's 12.8% gain. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund has gained 6% this year.\n\nNow read more markets coverage from Markets Insider and Business Insider:",

    "title": "President Trump to Seek $8.6 Billion for U.S.-Mexico Border Wall Funding in New Budget Request",
    "description": "President Trump will request at least $8.6 billion in new funding for the construction of a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border on Monday.",
    "text": "President Donald Trump will request at least $8.6 billion in new funding for the construction of a wall on the U.S.-Mexican border as part of his budget request to be released Monday. The budget plan will also assume continued robust economic growth in the U.S.\n\nThe president\u2019s proposal asks for an additional $5 billion in funding for the Department of Homeland Security and $3.6 billion in new military construction funds, according to a senior administration official, who requested anonymity to discuss the plan ahead of its release.\n\nThe request is in addition to the $6.7 billion that Trump is hoping to allocate through executive action after declaring a national emergency over the situation on the border in February, and is likely to tee up a new battle with Congress.\n\n\u201cThe whole issue of the wall, of border security, is of paramount importance,\u201d National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow said Sunday in an interview with Fox News. \u201cWe have a crisis down there.\u201d\n\nThe White House request, reported earlier by Reuters, represents the first marker in what\u2019s certain to be another protracted battle between the White House and congressional negotiators.\n\nTrump rejected a bipartisan funding agreement in late 2018 because it didn\u2019t include enough wall funding, leading to a 35-day federal government shutdown. He finally agreed to reopen the government when lawmakers provided him $1.375 billion for new border construction, and announced his plans for the national emergency.\n\nTrump said he\u2019s \u201cstopping an invasion\u201d of the U.S. in Twitter comments Saturday directed at conservative commentator Ann Coulter, whose criticism reportedly helped inspire his decision to hunker down for a record-long shutdown.\n\nThe request is just a part of the president\u2019s 2020 budget blueprint, which he\u2019s expected to present to lawmakers on Monday. It\u2019s the first since Democrats won control of the House in November\u2019s mid-term elections, and will kick off months of bargaining over his spending requests and proposed funding cuts for many domestic programs.\n\nThe budget document also includes economic projections for the next decade, with the administration forecasting continued expansion.\n\nThe budget document will project the economy growing at an average of 3 percent annually over the net decade, according to the official, including 3.2 percent growth for 2019. The White House predicts the economy will grow 3.1 percent in 2020, 3 percent in 2021, and 2.8 percent in 2026. The economic projections were first reported by the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe projections are at odds with those of many private forecasters. A Bloomberg survey puts the consensus U.S. GDP forecast for 2019 at 2.5 percent, trailing off to 1.9 percent in 2020 as the impact of the 2017 Republican tax cuts fades.\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.",

    "description": "President Trump says a physical wall needs to be the main line of defense in the south. But a visit to several border towns in Texas shows that isn\u2019t necessarily the case.",
    "text": "Marcos Rios spent 10 hours on a cold Monday in February waiting for the start of Donald J. Trump's rally in El Paso, Texas. Holding a fluorescent green handwritten sign with the words \"Trump Por Vida\" -- or \"Trump for Life\" -- Rios was there to see the man in person and hear his plans for a border wall. He voted for the 45th president in 2016 and will again in 2020.\n\nEven so, he doesn't get Trump's wall.\n\nEnlarge Image Amy Kim/CNET\n\n\"It might deter some people, but it's not going to work,\" says Rios, a 59-year-old school bus driver from El Paso. \"They already have tunnels. If you wanna come here, you're gonna come here.\"\n\nTexas has become ground zero in the border wall war. Rios wants a solution to drug trafficking and illegal immigration but questions whether a physical barrier along the US-Mexico border is needed. He's not the only Texan who thinks so. While the state overwhelmingly voted for Trump in 2016 and thousands of people cheered the president on at the El Paso rally, interviews with Texans who'll have to live and deal with a concrete wall or steel barrier -- plus a mix of drones, high-tech cameras, sensors, license plate scanners and other digital surveillance systems -- say the wall may be a hard sell.\n\nJames Martin/CNET\n\n\"We all want to have security in various ways and the border included,\" says John Ferguson, the mayor of Presidio, a border town east of El Paso. \"But Trump's wall would make the United States a big, gated community.\"\n\nThe president's El Paso rally was his first in 2019 -- and the first after a 35-day government shutdown over his request for $5.7 billion from US taxpayers to fund a border wall. Trump didn't pick El Paso for his latest wall pitch by accident. A high desert city of 685,000 people located on the western-most edge of Texas, El Paso is separated from Mexico by the narrow Rio Grande River. It's a major port of entry where immigrants have crossed into the US for decades. It's also where nearly four miles of a new 18-foot steel bollard wall was installed over the last six months.\n\n\"You have thousands and thousands of people coming from Guatemala, from Honduras and El Salvador, and they march up through Mexico,\" Trump boomed into the microphone at the rally. \"If we didn't have walls in those areas \u2026 in many cases where our great military helped us with barbed wire, you would have people pouring in.\"\n\nTrump's wall would make the United States a big, gated community. John Ferguson, mayor of Presidio, Texas\n\nFast-forward a month and Trump's wall proposal keeps feeding a political firestorm, even while data shows illegal immigration is at a historical low. Not only was the wall the cause of the government shutdown, but it also prompted lawsuits, protests and a constitutional dispute over what constitutes a national emergency. Last week, Trump, 72, asked for another $8.6 billion in wall funding in a federal budget proposal that was almost immediately dismissed by his critics. Yet, the president is determined to expand border walls. For the first time in his two-year tenure, Trump used his veto power to reject a congressional resolution that says there's no national emergency at the southern border.\n\nIf all goes according to Trump's current plans, roughly 550 miles of wall will be built along the nearly 2,000-mile-long US-Mexico border as soon as possible. The majority of this construction is expected to happen in Texas. Unlike California, Arizona and New Mexico, which already have about 60 percent of fencing or walls at their borders, Texas only has around 20 percent because of its natural barrier with Mexico: the Rio Grande River.\n\nThe slow-moving, silty-green river serves as the official southern border for the entire state. Starting in El Paso, it bends and winds through the mountains of the Chihuahuan Desert into Big Bend National Park's 1,500-foot-deep canyons, then through the grapefruit orchards and cotton crops of the Rio Grande Valley. Eventually, the river empties out through a sandy beach into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nJames Martin/CNET\n\nI set out to travel the length of the Texas-Mexico border, more than 1,200 miles, to find out how the wall -- and surveillance technology -- will affect those living along the river. Such a barrier is expected to drastically change the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. Local sheriffs and US Border Patrol agents say they've already been using technology to police the region for decades. And now, they're finding themselves in the middle of a major Silicon Valley-style shakeup.\n\nDespite Trump's insistence on a physical barrier, politicians throughout Texas are touting new technology as an alternative to physical walls. They're calling out everything from seismic sensors to lidar and fiber-optic cables as a partial solution for stopping drug cartels and stemming unwanted immigration. A \"smart wall,\" they say, will be cheaper, more effective and do a better job of helping Border Patrol agents than a concrete or steel barrier.\n\n\"We can't double down on a third-century approach to solve 21st century problems,\" Rep. Will Hurd, a Republican whose district covers more than 800 miles of the Texas-Mexico border, said in a statement. \"It's time to harness American innovation.\"\n\nThe smart wall\n\nPresidio County is southeast of El Paso and smack in the middle of the Chihuahuan Desert, a nearly 140,000-square-mile expanse that stretches across the southwestern US and northern Mexico. Here, the high plains give way to hazy, yellowish mountains devoid of trees and full of cactus, rattlesnakes and rocky cliffs.\n\nDespite the empty, wind-swept feeling of Presidio County, it's a hotbed of high-tech border security initiatives.\n\nNow playing: Watch this: Not all Texans want a border wall\n\nThe federal government is pouring money into smart wall technology. The Department of Homeland Security earmarked $975.8 million for border tech in its 2018 budget proposal and $223 million in its 2019 budget proposal.\n\nThe government already employs many of the same tools at the border the US military uses in war zones -- from tethered surveillance blimps called aerostats, that cost about $8.9 million each, to $16 million Predator B drones equipped with radar strong enough to detect footprints in the sand.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security is now in talks to fly smaller unmanned drones on nighttime border missions out of the Marfa Airport in Presidio County, according to Airports Director Chase Snodgrass. Called the RQ-7 Shadow, made by AAI Corporation, this drone uses an array of cameras, lasers and radars to \"locate, recognize and identify targets\" up to 75 miles away. It then beams that information back to a ground control station. The devices have been used in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nBut to deploy the drones, the airport will have to close for hour-long blocks of time amid daily takeoffs and landings. That's rankled residents.\n\n\"Let's just say I haven't had anybody local call me and say it was a great idea,\" Snodgrass says. \"But I've had quite a few calling to say they don't like it.\"\n\nDara Kerr/CNET\n\nDrones are just the beginning when it comes to high-tech border surveillance. The government is working with more than 30 tech companies to develop tools for national security. That's everything from lidar systems, which is the same laser light technology used in self-driving cars that measures the distance to a target, to machine-learning AI software to Bluetooth and Wi-Fi sensors that can measure a crowd's behavior and movement.\n\nAnduril may be the best-known of these companies. Its creator, Palmer Luckey, founded the virtual reality company Oculus that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg bought for nearly $3 billion in 2014. Luckey left Facebook in 2017 after it was revealed he funded a pro-Trump group working to influence the 2016 election.\n\nNamed after a magical sword in Lord of the Rings, Anduril says its goal is to be the future of defense. Using a system it calls Lattice, the company can process inputs from hundreds of thousands of sensors strategically placed along the border -- including 20-megapixel visual cameras, thermal cameras and radar -- and then use artificial intelligence to instantaneously interpret that data.\n\nFor example, Lattice can continuously monitor one stretch of desert and the moment it detects anything out of the ordinary, like a vehicle pulling over or a group of people walking, Border Patrol will be alerted.\n\nWe can't look at defending our border in a static way, because the threat is dynamic. Congressman Will Hurd\n\nAnduril has a contract with US Customs and Border Protection in California and is testing its tech on a private ranch in West Texas.\n\nThe rancher had cartel traffic crossing his land, the company says, so he let Anduril give Lattice a whirl. In the first few months, the system led to the capture of 39 migrants crossing the border, along with 16 drug smugglers carrying 982 pounds of marijuana, according to a report by Wired.\n\nAnduril says this rancher no longer has problems with cartel traffic because the system now works as a deterrent. The company confirmed these details but declined to comment further.\n\nWhen Hurd talks about a smart wall, it's tech like Anduril's he envisions. He sees the digital barrier beaming real-time info to Border Patrol agents' smartphones about every drug trafficker and human smuggler who crosses the international boundary.\n\n\"We always have to remember the enemy adapts,\" says Hurd, a former CIA officer who now sits on the House Intelligence Committee. \"That's why we can't look at defending our border in a static way, because the threat is dynamic.\"\n\nJames Martin/CNET\n\nIt's hard to escape the impression the border is being militarized, which is why groups like the American Civil Liberties Union warn that smart wall tech could have serious privacy implications. The ACLU says allowing the Department of Homeland Security \"to track, surveil and monitor individuals indiscriminately and with precise detail\" could lead to intrusions on the most intimate aspects of Americans' lives.\n\nBut Hurd and the Silicon Valley companies working on border security say a smart wall is fundamental to protecting the border. Even so, it's unlikely that will sway the president.\n\n\"They can have all the drones they want flying up in the air and spinning around, and all the technology in the world. It's all -- I call it 'bells and whistles,'\" Trump said during a Christmas video teleconference. \"But if you don't have the wall, it doesn't work.\"\n\nEmergency on the border\n\nCurious what locals think about Trump's wall, I head to the dusty little border town of Presidio -- the only place to legally cross between the US and Mexico for hundreds of miles. About 4,000 people live here, mostly in single-story homes where dogs bark from behind chain-link fences. This is the land of pickup trucks and red enchiladas.\n\nMayor Ferguson, a friendly, soft-spoken 55-year-old with thick brown hair full of cowlicks, offers to be my tour guide. He's been the mayor on and off for about nine years and has worked in local public schools most of his adult life.\n\nWe start by walking over the international bridge. A few elderly women with shopping bags and young men on bicycles make their way back and forth between the US and Mexico, but it's mostly empty. Down below, the Rio Grande cuts between Presidio and its sister city, Ojinaga. The river is narrow enough here that you can throw a rock and hit the other side.\n\nDara Kerr/CNET\n\n\"What you'll find along the Texas border is people who've lived here forever,\" Ferguson explains. \"Most of the water you see is coming out of Mexico. A lot of people use that water.\"\n\nI ask him where the wall would go if Trump's plans fall into place. He sighs deeply and just says, \"Yeah\u2026\"\n\nAfter a few moments, he points to the banks of the river on the US side and says, \"You could run it along the levy. But then you look here and the levy curves and so you say, 'OK, now what?'\n\n\"It's not so simple that you're going to build this big wall,\" he adds. \"If we were to build a wall, we'd lose our own river.\"\n\nThe idea of a border wall long predates President Trump. The US has been putting up barriers along its southern border for the last century. After President Bill Clinton signed the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994, 18 miles of wall were added. After 9/11, President George W. Bush spearheaded plans for an additional 523 miles, much of which was built during President Barack Obama's tenure.\n\nToday, 654 miles of the 1,954-mile US-Mexico border -- about a third of the distance -- has some sort of wall or fencing. The areas without any wall tend to have natural barriers, like mountains or the Rio Grande. So far, no new miles of Trump's proposed 18-to-30 foot wall have been constructed. But at least 40 miles of replacement wall -- like the new steel barrier in El Paso -- have been added.\n\nJames Martin/CNET\n\nKeeping up with the daily back-and-forth of whether a wall will be built is dizzying.\n\nTo recap what's been going on the past several weeks: Congress passed a spending measure in mid-February to avoid another government shutdown. Trump signed the measure, which would pay $1.375 billion for 55 miles of steel fencing, but he was unhappy with the deal. So the following day he announced an unprecedented national emergency that would allow him to tap into more than $6 billion additional funds to build the wall. The money would be diverted from other government reserves, like a military construction fund and a military antidrug account.\n\nWithin days of Trump's declaration, lawsuits were filed challenging his use of emergency powers. One of those suits was brought by a coalition of 16 US states. In the suits, lawyers cited Trump's own announcement on the national emergency.\n\n\"I could do the wall over a longer period of time,\" Trump said. \"I didn't need to do this. But I'd rather do it much faster.\"\n\nOn March 14, Congress passed a resolution to terminate the president's national emergency. One day later, Trump vetoed that resolution. The legislation now heads back to Congress where the resolution's supporters need to get enough votes to override the president's veto.\n\nIf we were to build a wall, we'd lose our own river. John Ferguson, Presidio mayor\n\nWhile it's unclear how Washington's battle will shake out, a lot of people in Texas are left scratching their heads.\n\n\"Here we stand at the international border, and there's no wall and there's no people crossing the river,\" Ferguson says, looking down at the water below. \"You'd think if there was an emergency going on there'd be all sorts of people here to apprehend. But there's not.\"\n\n'We see everything'\n\nIn Brewster County, just south of Presidio, I meet with the local sheriff. Brewster County is cowboy country. Known for vast cattle ranches and tabletop mesas, it's the biggest county in Texas -- almost equal in size to Connecticut. It's also the most rural with just 9,000 residents.\n\nFrigid winds blow across its inhospitable landscape throughout the winter, and scorching desert sun cracks its earth in the summer. Surviving out here is no easy feat. Locals say an unspoken policy is to leave your home unlocked so traveling migrants can go in, get water and not break the windows.\n\nDara Kerr/CNET\n\nSheriff Ronny Dodson's office is in a quaint red-brick building that used to be the county jail. He looks the part of a Texan sheriff: tall, with broad shoulders, a cowboy hat and a woven leather gun holster. Dodson's family has been in Brewster Country for six generations stretching back before the Mexican Revolution. Pancho Villa's rebel group once famously raided his great grandfather's ranch, forcing his family into hiding.\n\nWhile the Border Patrol's job is to catch people entering the US illegally, a lot of that work also falls under Dodson's jurisdiction. That's because Brewster County, with its 192 border miles, has more border territory than any other county in the US.\n\n\"The president is going to El Paso and he went to McAllen, those are big places,\" Dodson says, taking off his cowboy hat to smooth down his hair. \"It's different out here.\"\n\nHe regularly catches small groups of people walking through the desert with more than 100-pound backpacks of drugs -- marijuana being the main drug he finds. He also apprehends immigrants coming to the US. But, he says, they're not pouring in.\n\n\"This country has a hunger for cheap labor and a hunger for narcotics,\" Dodson says. \"As long as we have that hunger, they're coming.\"\n\n\"This country has a hunger for cheap labor and a hunger for narcotics. As long as we have that hunger, they're coming. Ronny Dodson, Brewster County sheriff\n\nHe takes out his smartphone to show me photos from hidden cameras that he set up along the border. One photo shows six or seven people in dark blue hoodies huddled behind a mound of dirt. He tells me they are migrants planning to cross the border.\n\n\"They didn't know the camera was there taking pictures of them,\" Dodson says. \"The tech we have now lets us see everything.\"\n\nTo prove his point, he shows me other photos he caught of wild animals, including mountain lions, gray foxes and even Mexican black bears. Along with cameras, Dodson uses handheld drones and buried seismic ground sensors to augment his work. But, unlike federal security agencies, he says state and local law enforcement is limited with how much tech it can use because of lack of funding.\n\n\"We see guys come to our conferences and they set up these magnificent cameras,\" Dodson says, but these cameras cost $500,000. \"There's no way we could afford half a million dollars, not in this county.\"\n\nBrewster County's border is full of natural barriers, including Santa Elena Canyon and its towering cliff walls and the deadly Chihuahuan Desert. A border wall can be practical in places like El Paso and McAllen, Dodson says, but it doesn't make a lot of sense out here.\n\nDara Kerr/CNET\n\nBefore the sheriff shows me one last photo on his phone, he asks, \"Do you have a strong stomach?\"\n\nHe pulls up a picture of a dead migrant that he and his deputies were called to handle last summer. The man is lying in the dirt among the cactus. He isn't wearing a shirt and his bloated body is burned completely black. His face and hands have been eaten away, presumably by insects and animals. Dodson told me it was 120 degrees on the day he found the man.\n\n\"They tear off their clothes when they're dying of thirst, because they think it'll help,\" Dodson says. \"It's pretty terrible what happens to some of these guys.\"\n\nLike a rolling stone\n\nDriving through the desolate desert landscape, I see in the distance a roadblock constructed of orange cones leading to a small green-and-white building. Border Patrol agents wearing army-green uniforms signal me to slow down and stop.\n\n\"Where are you coming from,\" an agent asks, shining his flashlight into the back seat and trunk of my rental car. \"Are you an American citizen?\"\n\nThese checkpoints are all along border highways, and every car coming through is required to stop. A bevy of cameras and sensors usually takes images of people's vehicles, including their license plates. The agents are accompanied by dogs trained to detect drugs.\n\nEnlarge Image Dara Kerr/CNET\n\nThey wave me on after I answer their questions. I'm headed to the central region of the Texas-Mexico border to catch a nighttime ride with Border Patrol agents and see firsthand how Central American asylum seekers are faring after caravanning across Mexico.\n\nWith the barren yellow-hued mountains receding in my rearview mirror, I think back to the Trump rally in El Paso.\n\nAs the president's speech continued into the night, the crowd seemed to lose energy and people began to trickle out of the coliseum. When Trump finally finished after an hour and 20 minutes, he slowly made his way offstage waving, clapping and mouthing \"thank you.\"\n\nMusic rose over the loudspeakers and, as if on cue, the song was the Rolling Stones' You Can't Always Get What You Want.\n\nIn West Texas, that sentiment might come true.\n\nStay tuned for \"Cat and Mouse,\" the second article in our border trilogy.\n\nCorrection, 3:23 p.m.: Fixes formal title of US Customs and Border Protection.",

    "title": "Trump To Ask Congress For Additional $8.6 Billion For Border Wall In New Budget",
    "description": "The demand is six times what Congress allocated for border projects in each of the past two fiscal years.",
    "text": "WASHINGTON, March 10 (Reuters) \u2015 President Donald Trump on Monday will ask the U.S. Congress for an additional $8.6 billion to help pay for the wall he promised to build on the southern border with Mexico to combat illegal immigration and drug trafficking, officials familiar with his 2020 budget request told Reuters.\n\nThe demand is more than six times what Congress allocated for border projects in each of the past two fiscal years, and 6 percent more than Trump has corralled by invoking emergency powers this year.\n\nDemocrats, who oppose the wall as unnecessary and immoral, control the U.S. House of Representatives, making it unlikely the Republican president\u2019s request will win congressional passage. Republicans control the Senate.\n\nThe proposal comes on the heels of a bruising battle with Congress over wall funding that resulted in a five-week partial federal government shutdown that ended in January, and could touch off a sequel just ahead of a trifecta of ominous fiscal deadlines looming this fall.\n\nRegardless of whether Congress passes it, the budget request could help Trump frame his argument on border security as the 2020 presidential race begins to take shape, with the president seeking re-election.\n\n\u201cBuild the wall\u201d was one of his signature campaign pledges in his first run for office in 2016. \u201cFinish the wall\u201d is already a feature of his re-election campaign, a rallying cry plastered across banners and signs at his campaign rallies.\n\n\u201cIt gives the president the ability to say he has fulfilled his commitment to gain operational control of the southwest border,\u201d an administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said of the budget request.\n\n\u201cWe have provided the course of action, the strategy and the request to finish the job. It\u2019s a question of, will Congress allow us to finish the job,\u201d a second administration official said.\n\nFunding legislation needs to be passed before Oct. 1 - the start of the 2020 federal fiscal year - or the government could shut down again. If Congress and the White House fail to agree to lift mandatory spending caps set in a 2011 law, steep automatic cuts in many programs would kick in. Around the same time, Trump and lawmakers must agree to lift the debt ceiling, or risk a default, which would have chaotic economic fallout.\n\n722 Miles Of Wall\n\nTrump\u2019s wall request is based off a 2017 plan put forward by Customs and Border Protection officials to build or replace 722 miles (1,162 km) of barrier along the border, which in total is estimated to cost about $18 billion.\n\nSo far, only 111 miles (179 km) have been built or are underway, officials said. In fiscal 2017, $341 million in funding was allocated for 40 miles (64 km) of wall, and in 2018, another $1.375 billion was directed to 82 miles (132 km).\n\nFor fiscal 2019, Trump demanded $5.7 billion in wall funds, but Congress appropriated only $1.375 billion for border fencing projects.\n\nFollowing the rejection of his wall funding demand, Trump declared the border was a national emergency - a move opposed by Democrats and some Republicans - and redirected $601 million in Treasury Department forfeiture funds, $2.5 billion in Defense Department drug interdiction funds and $3.6 billion from a military construction budget, for total spending of $8.1 billion for the wall.\n\nThe administration has not estimated how far the 2019 funds will go, but officials said average costs are about $25 million per mile (1.6 km).\n\nTrump\u2019s $8.6 billion in proposed wall funding for fiscal 2020 would include $5 billion from the Department of Homeland Security budget and $3.6 billion from the Pentagon\u2019s military construction budget. The budget proposal will also include another $3.6 million in military construction funding to make up for any projects delayed by the wall, officials said.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security is one of a few priority areas to get a boost in Trump\u2019s budget plan, which seeks to slash funding to many non-defense programs.\n\nTrump will propose an overall 5 percent increase to the Department of Homeland Security budget over fiscal 2019 appropriations, including $3.3 billion, or 22 percent more, for Customs and Border Protection, and $1.2 billion more for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a 16 percent hike, officials said.\n\nThe budget proposal includes a plan to hire more than 2,800 law enforcement and support personnel for the agencies, and 100 immigration judge teams, officials said.\n\nTrump faces both political and court battles to free up the money he wants for the current fiscal year. Many lawmakers accused Trump of overstepping his constitutional powers by declaring an emergency to free up the funds. The House has already voted to revoke the emergency, and the Senate is likely to do the same this week. Trump is expected to veto the resolution.\n\nA coalition of state governments led by California has sued Trump to block the emergency move, though legal experts have said the lawsuits face a difficult road.",

    "title": "Here\u2019s What to Make of February\u2019s \u2018Abysmal\u2019 Jobs Reports, According to Wall Street Analysts",
    "description": "Wall Street analysts help give perspective to jobs reports after the U.S. economy added 20,000 jobs in February, the fewest in over a year.",
    "text": "Stocks, bond yields and the dollar fell on news the U.S. economy added 20,000 jobs in February, the fewest in more than a year, while worker pay jumped more than economists predicted. With the S&P 500 on track for its worst week of 2019, here\u2019s what strategists are saying about the unemployment report.\n\nKristina Hooper, chief global market strategist at Invesco\n\n\u201cThe February jobs report was abysmal in terms of non-farm payroll but we have to put it in the context of incredibly strong January nonfarm payrolls. However, that is not going to be solace to investors, who have been put on alert by dramatic changes in monetary policy stances by first the Fed and then the Bank of Canada and most recently the European Central Bank. This jobs report will only amplify market worries.\u201d\n\nSameer Samana, senior global market strategist for Wells Fargo Investment Institute\n\n\u201cIf the weakness continues next month and there\u2019s no revision to this month, it\u2019s a meaningful deceleration in the outlook for the labor market. Given what happened in the fourth quarter, it could be that companies now are at this point at least deciding to really curtail hiring. If there\u2019s going to be all these uncertainties around trade, politics, possibly taxes as we head into the 2020 election cycle, it could be corporations are going look, \u2018I really need to in a more meaningful way start to prepare for the next downturn.\u201d\u2019\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll probably put downward pressure on stocks, it\u2019ll probably put downward pressure on interest rates. For the dollar, we\u2019ll have to wait and see, but Europe is pretty weak too, so it could be overtime the dollar continues to do OK. And then you\u2019re starting to see gold do better and that\u2019s probably a two-part concern. One, it\u2019s probably concern about a slowdown, and then two, it\u2019s at least speculation around when and if central banks may become even easier. We\u2019re at patient right now, but it could be they start to shift from patient to possibly cutting. Again, way too soon to make that switch, but that\u2019s what the gold market is telling you.\u201d\n\nThe Brief Newsletter Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now. View Sample Sign Up Now\n\nAlec Young, managing director of global markets research at FTSE Russell\n\n\u201cFebruary\u2019s anemic 20,000 new jobs will inevitably exacerbate widespread fears of slowing economic growth, making it harder to be optimistic about corporate earnings. Meanwhile, the 3.4% year-over-year jump in wages represents a growing threat to profit margins. All in all, there\u2019s little in this report to excite investors.\u201d\n\nChad Morganlander, portfolio manager at Washington Crossing Advisors\n\n\u201cThere jobs numbers are noisy because the government shutdown, but it\u2019s clear that the U.S. economy is moderating. You\u2019re seeing this push-pull between dovish monetary policy and deteriorating economic trend. Economic fundamentals will eventually win out, and investors are aware of that. Growth rate decelerates, housing data shows a break in growth, geopolitical concerns are not going away, and investors will wake up to that and sniff out higher recession possibilities.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe world is interconnected with a deceleration of growth on a global basis will start to spill over into U.S. You will probably start to see more economic data not looking good in the course of the next several quarters. Yet you haven\u2019t seen a substantial drop in earnings revisions, where they take the expectations to negative. We would fade the risk-on trade at this point, a great amount of news is backed in, from dovish monetary policy to potential deal on trade.\u201d\n\nJim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Leuthold Weeden Capital Management\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s enough in the internals of this report, I think, to calm traders down on this number \u2026 It\u2019s not like people weren\u2019t expecting job creation to slow down, so I think that it\u2019s not that shocking that maybe it is a little bit, but if you average out the payroll number and the household number, it comes in at a fairly decent gain.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cIt will become a neutral report here, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re getting around this market right now. We\u2019re getting a mixed bag of bad reports and good reports\u2026at the end of the day, the most you can say out of all of this data is the economy has slowed, which we know, but it\u2019s probably not falling off a cliff, which is also an important part of this. So I think the stock market reaction is not a lot, it was already down quite a bit before this report came out, it hasn\u2019t moved a lot more. I think as the day wears on, it\u2019s going to have more to do with the failing at 4 times at 2800 on the S&P and technicals than it will about these reports.\u2019\u2019\n\nContact us at editors@time.com.",

But at the same time, we\u2019re also going to say that we have many, many programs that are wasteful and inefficient that we can no longer afford.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s \u201cBudget for a Better America\u201d features dozens of spending cuts and policy overhauls.\n\nTotal spending on Medicare, the popular health-care program for the elderly that in the past he had largely said he would protect, would be reduced by about $845 billion over 10 years. Some of those savings \u2014 possibly between $250 billion and $300 billion, according to an estimate from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget\u2019s Marc Goldwein \u2014 would be redirected to other health programs, but most would be removed from the budget.\n\nThe president\u2019s budget also proposes a major overhaul of Medicaid, the health-care program for low-income Americans run jointly with states, by turning more power over to states and cutting spending by $241 billion over 10 years.\n\n\u201cThe cruel and shortsighted cuts in President Trump\u2019s budget request are a road map to a sicker, weaker America,\u201d said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), effectively dooming the budget by promising that the House would reject it.\n\n[President Trump\u2019s White House budget proposal for fiscal 2020]\n\nEven with the cuts in Trump\u2019s budget, the spending plan predicts annual deficits to top $1 trillion from 2019 through 2022, a threshold that has caused consternation within GOP ranks for weeks and only came into sharp focus on Monday.\n\nSome agencies, particularly the Environmental Protection Agency and the departments of State, Transportation, Education and Interior would see their budgets severely reduced. The Commerce Department budget would increase in preparation for the 2020 Census, but Democrats said the census money was insufficient.\n\nTrump\u2019s GOP allies, meanwhile, gave the budget plan a lukewarm reception.\n\nSenate Budget Committee Chairman Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.) said the proposal was \u201cthe first step in the federal budget process and will allow us to consider how his priorities align with the priorities of Congress.\u201d\n\nThe budget was full of provisions that Republicans have long embraced but had not been put forward on such a scale. It would impose mandatory work requirements on millions of people who receive welfare assistance, including for food and housing, while dramatically increasing the defense budget to $750 billion next year, a 5 percent increase from 2019.\n\nTrump and other Republicans have said the federal budget is full of waste, arguing that many federal agencies could function with less taxpayer money.\n\nStill, according to Trump\u2019s budget, the spending cuts would do little to reduce what is shaping up to be a colossal deficit in the next several years. The deficit is the annual gap between spending and tax revenue.\n\nThe budget foresees $1.1 trillion deficits in 2019, 2020, and 2021, and a $1 trillion deficit in 2022. Asked about this, Vought said: \u201cWe do have large deficits. That\u2019s why we are here transparently saying we have a problem as a country.\u201d\n\nWhite House officials think the budget proposal would eliminate the deficit by 2035, but Democrats faulted the plan for relying on rosy estimates of future economic growth to create large increases in future tax revenue.\n\n[Trump to demand $8.6 billion in new wall funding, setting up fresh battle with Congress]\n\nThese deficits will add to the existing $22 trillion debt and have tremendous impact on government spending. For example, the White House now projects that the government will spend $482 billion on interest payments for the debt next year, more than the entire budget for Medicaid.\n\nRepublicans have long called for taking steps that shrink \u2014 or even eliminate \u2014 the deficit, and putting forward a plan that would create $4.3 trillion in new debt over four years could give Democrats a fresh target on the campaign trail.\n\nThere is a crowded field of Democrats seeking the nomination to challenge Trump in the next presidential election, and at a time when Trump is trying to pull the country to the right, the Democratic Party has moved left.\n\nSeveral Democratic senators running for president have backed the Medicare-for-all legislation of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), which would expand federal spending on the health program by as much as $30 trillion, just as the Trump administration is looking to cut those costs.\n\nTrump\u2019s budget also calls for maintaining existing federal funding for child-care programs, hoping to generate additional spending at the state level. Democratic candidates have called for the federal government to increase its spending on child care, with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) recently unveiling a plan that would ensure free, government-subsidized child care for every American earning less than about $50,000 annually.\n\nThe administration\u2019s budget also revives its push for an infrastructure bill, asking for $200 billion in federal dollars over 10 years, which it says will lead to $1 trillion in federal, state and private spending on roads, housing, ports and other investments.\n\nSome Democratic presidential hopefuls have called for programs on a much bigger scale, with candidate Sanders recently calling for the federal government to rescind the 2017 GOP tax cut, estimated to cost about $1.5 trillion, and spend $1 trillion in new federal dollars on the nation\u2019s roads, bridges and highways, among other things.\n\nHouse Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth (D-Ky.) said the White House spending blueprint would give presidential challengers plenty of material to show how their agenda is different.\n\n\u201cIf I were running against him I would sure use it against him,\u201d he said.\n\nWhite House officials think Trump\u2019s economic agenda has been successful so far, leading to job growth, higher wages and economic expansion. But critics allege he achieved this in part through huge levels of fiscal stimulus, including tax cuts and spending increases, that have widened the deficit and added several trillion dollars to the government\u2019s debt.\n\nAdministration officials say the funding request for the border would allow them to complete 722 miles of barriers, the full amount they have identified as necessary. Building the wall would fulfill Trump\u2019s core campaign promise, although it would have U.S. taxpayers footing the bill for something he long claimed would be paid for by Mexico.\n\nThe defense spending increase in the budget includes funneling more than $170 billion into a special overseas account, something even some Republicans dismissed as a gimmick aimed at getting around existing spending caps. However, defense hawks on Capitol Hill welcomed the Pentagon budget increase. Rep. Mac Thornberry of Texas, the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, warned against getting \u201cdistracted by the construction of the budget request.\u201d\n\nThe budget does reflect the changing nature of Trump\u2019s agenda since taking office.\n\nHe has continued to try to pump more money into the military and border security programs, and the budget provides funding for the creation of a Space Force, and a U.S. Space Command, ideas Trump has personally pushed even while running into some resistance from military leaders and congressional Republicans.\n\nSenate Appropriations Chairman Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.) said last week that he\u2019s skeptical about the need to create a new branch of the military to deal with space.\n\nAnd despite Trump\u2019s decision to slash spending for most Cabinet agencies, his budget makes room for women- and family-focused priorities embraced by Ivanka Trump, his daughter and adviser. It includes a provision supporting state paid family leave programs, and allocates $100 million for her recently launched Women\u2019s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative, an effort to help women in the workforce succeed as entrepreneurs.\n\nWhile Democratic rivals for the White House next year ramp up their attacks on the president\u2019s policy agenda, Democrats in Congress are planning to challenge Trump in the coming months on his budget plan. In addition to the Sept. 30 deadline for a spending agreement, lawmakers think they will need to reach a deal to raise the debt ceiling about that time.\n\nThe debt ceiling is a borrowing cap established by Congress, and it prohibits the Treasury Department from issuing more debt. The government is bumping up against the debt limit now, and the Treasury has begun emergency steps to buy more time so Congress can eventually vote to raise it. Several lawmakers have said they expect the debt ceiling to be raised as part of a broader budget deal this summer or fall.\n\nBut if budget talks bog down later this year amid a fight over the border wall, it could force lawmakers to rethink the timeline and their entire approach.",

She does not see migrants make their way out of the waters of the nearby Rio Grande river and through her yard into America. There are no smugglers at her doorstep.\n\nInstead, the biggest threat she sees to her family\u2019s home and heritage is coming from an American government keen on fulfilling the campaign promise of a man who regularly casts migrants as criminals.

The letters are the first step for the government to seize land from private owners.\n\nBut Ms Gaytan, like many others, plans on fighting back, and does not believe the wall is necessary to keep her quiet corner of the US safe.\n\nBecause it already is safe, she says. While Mr Trump warns of human trafficking, her children often hike down on their own from the bluff where her family\u2019s home was built, more than 50 years ago, to the Rio Grande, hoping to catch rainbow trout and other fish native to those waters. Even though the president warns of gang members and \u201cbad hombres\u201d crossing into the US, Ms Gaytan leaves her purse in her truck overnight and does not lock the front door.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of uncertainty,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat are we going to do if they take everything?\u201d\n\nThe kind of fight Ms Gaytan has found herself in is nothing new to the residents along the Rio Grande, however.\n\nSince 2006, when the Secure Fencing Act authorised roughly 700 miles worth of border fencing to be constructed during the administration of president George W Bush, the US government has forced private property owners off their property, leading to dozens of lawsuits, some of which are still pending.\n\nThis policy of seizing private land continued during the Obama administration \u2013 and now into the Trump administration, which has been markedly more aggressive on the issue.\n\nBut the situation in 2019 is somewhat different. Much of the land where fencing was built during that previous effort was erected on federally owned lands in Arizona, California and New Mexico. So, the landowners in Texas have some bargaining chips, even if experts say border fencing has often qualified as \u201cpublic use\u201d in previous court cases where landowners challenged the government\u2019s use of eminent domain, which allows the state or federal government to take private property for public use while requiring \u201cjust\u201d compensation to be given to the original owner.\n\nMr Trump, who once attempted to use the power of eminent domain in the 1990s to kick an elderly woman off a property adjacent to his hotel in New Jersey to build a parking lot, hopes to negotiate deals with private landowners along the border, but the lawsuits popping up show that won\u2019t be so easy.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re doing with eminent domain is, in many cases, we\u2019ll make a deal up front. We\u2019ve already done that. The secretary has done a lot of that,\u201d the president told reporters in January without providing further details.\n\nHe continued: \u201cAnd if we can\u2019t make a deal, we take the land and we pay them through a court process. Which goes actually fairly quickly. And we\u2019re generous. But we take the land. Otherwise you could never build anything. If you didn\u2019t use eminent domain, you wouldn\u2019t have one highway in this country. You have to use eminent domain.\u201d\n\nUS Customs and Border Protection, which along with the US Army Corps of Engineers sent the letters to property owners, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLegal experts say judges are often quite deferential to the government when it comes to things like border walls.\n\n\u201cWhat it\u2019s going to come down to is how deferential the court will be to the finding of the federal government that this is for a public use,\u201d says Michael Wolf, a professor and expert in eminent domain at the University of Florida.\n\n\u201cPublic use is very broadly defined, and the protection of America from people we don\u2019t want coming across the border would certainly be to the public benefit.\u201d\n\nThe government knows that, right or wrong, forcing people off their land can cause major issues. A 2009 report compiled by the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s inspector general, for instance, found the legal headaches lead to delays and increased costs.\n\n\u201cGaining access rights and acquiring non-federal property has delayed the completion of fence construction and may increase the cost beyond available funding,\u201d that report said.\n\nEither way, that means the US court system could soon be clogged with hundreds of eminent domain challenges that will then make their way through the system, and could end up in jury trials.\n\nRicardo Garza, a staff attorney with the Texas Civil Rights Project, says his organisation is reaching out to landowners to help them when the government comes knocking. And they have seen this type of thing before.\n\n\u201cIn southern Texas this stuff has been going on for a long time,\u201d Mr Garza says. \u201cIt has been a bipartisan issue and it\u2019s unfortunately treating the border as a sacrifice zone.\u201d\n\nOther groups or landowners that have sued the government or are facing eminent domain claims from the government in recent months includes a Catholic chapel in Brownsville. And birdwatching groups who have sued say the border would prevent wildlife from getting to the river and would dehydrate vulnerable populations \u2013 or drown them when flooding occurs.\n\n\u201cIf you have 16-to-18ft vertical concrete walls \u2026 nothing can get out and noting can pass,\u201d Jim Chapman, the president of the Frontera Audubon Society says, noting other damaging features would include the clearing out of habitat within 150ft of the fence.\n\nAt the National Butterfly Centre in Mission, Texas, Marianna Trevino-Wright says she came across federal contractors last year while they were already beginning to survey the land and cut down trees. She encountered them months before appropriations to build any new wall were approved in Congress, she says, and was then visited by uniformed border officers who disputed that she had seen federal contractors on her land.\n\n\u201cI encountered five workers, three with chainsaws, one with a bush hog,\u201d Ms Trevino-Wright says of her initial encounter.\n\nMs Trevino-Wright says that, like Ms Gaytan\u2019s border-adjacent property, there is little or no migrant traffic coming through. Things are safe, she says. So much so that the centre hosts an annual camp out for Girl Scouts.\n\n\u201cLittle girls with their troop leaders come and spend the night outdoors here,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is a complete b******t state of emergency.\u201d\n\nMs Gaytan, the woman whose family has lived in their home on the border for five generations, says she supports border security but does not think a wall would be at all effective.\n\nShe has seen for herself, and heard the stories of walls only providing temporary barriers until criminals figure out how to get through them. Or over them. Or under them.\n\n\u201cA wall is just literally an illusion of safety. It\u2019s like my fence. Yes, I have a fence around my house. It\u2019s for the illusion of privacy, not security, because that is not going to stop anybody from coming in,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cIf they want to break into my house, if they want to steal something, they\u2019re just going to go ahead and do it.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) recently unveiling a plan that would ensure free, government-subsidized child care for every American earning less than about $50,000 annually.\n\nThe administration\u2019s budget also revives its push for an infrastructure bill, asking for $200 billion in federal dollars over 10 years, which it says will lead to $1 trillion in federal, state and private spending on roads, housing, ports and other investments.\n\nSome Democratic presidential hopefuls have called for programs on a much bigger scale, with candidate Sanders recently calling for the federal government to rescind the 2017 GOP tax cut, estimated to cost about $1.5 trillion, and spend $1 trillion in new federal dollars on the nation\u2019s roads, bridges and highways, among other things.\n\nHouse Budget Committee Chairman John Yarmuth (D-Ky.) said the White House spending blueprint would give presidential challengers plenty of material to show how their agenda is different.\n\n\u201cIf I were running against him I would sure use it against him,\u201d he said.\n\nWhite House officials think Trump\u2019s economic agenda has been successful so far, leading to job growth, higher wages and economic expansion. But critics allege he achieved this in part through huge levels of fiscal stimulus, including tax cuts and spending increases, that have widened the deficit and added several trillion dollars to the government\u2019s debt.\n\nAdministration officials say the funding request for the border would allow them to complete 722 miles of barriers, the full amount they have identified as necessary. Building the wall would fulfill Trump\u2019s core campaign promise, although it would have U.S. taxpayers footing the bill for something he long claimed would be paid for by Mexico.\n\nThe defense spending increase in the budget includes funneling more than $170 billion into a special overseas account, something even some Republicans dismissed as a gimmick aimed at getting around existing spending caps. However, defense hawks on Capitol Hill welcomed the Pentagon budget increase. Rep. Mac Thornberry of Texas, the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, warned against getting \u201cdistracted by the construction of the budget request.\u201d\n\nThe budget does reflect the changing nature of Trump\u2019s agenda since taking office.\n\nHe has continued to try to pump more money into the military and border security programs, and the budget provides funding for the creation of a Space Force, and a U.S. Space Command, ideas Trump has personally pushed even while running into some resistance from military leaders and congressional Republicans.\n\nSenate Appropriations Chairman Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.) said last week that he\u2019s skeptical about the need to create a new branch of the military to deal with space.\n\nAnd despite Trump\u2019s decision to slash spending for most Cabinet agencies, his budget makes room for women- and family-focused priorities embraced by Ivanka Trump, his daughter and adviser. It includes a provision supporting state paid family leave programs, and allocates $100 million for her recently launched Women\u2019s Global Development and Prosperity Initiative, an effort to help women in the workforce succeed as entrepreneurs.\n\nWhile Democratic rivals for the White House next year ramp up their attacks on the president\u2019s policy agenda, Democrats in Congress are planning to challenge Trump in the coming months on his budget plan. In addition to the Sept. 30 deadline for a spending agreement, lawmakers think they will need to reach a deal to raise the debt ceiling about that time.\n\nThe debt ceiling is a borrowing cap established by Congress, and it prohibits the Treasury Department from issuing more debt. The government is bumping up against the debt limit now, and the Treasury has begun emergency steps to buy more time so Congress can eventually vote to raise it. Several lawmakers have said they expect the debt ceiling to be raised as part of a broader budget deal this summer or fall.\n\nBut if budget talks bog down later this year amid a fight over the border wall, it could force lawmakers to rethink the timeline and their entire approach.",

    "text": "Rick Wilking/Reuters\n\nConsumer sentiment rose by more than expected to 97.8 in the first half of March.\n\nIncreasing optimism was concentrated among lower- and middle-class households.\n\nThe gains come after disappointing sentiment readings at the beginning of 2019.\n\nPublic confidence in the economy rose by more than expected in the US in early March, particularly among lower- and middle-class households.\n\nConsumer sentiment rose 4.3% from a month earlier to 97.8, preliminary results from the University of Michigan\u2019s monthly survey showed Friday, compared with economist expectations for a 95.6 reading. Final results are scheduled to be released at the end of the month.\n\nLower- and middle-class Americans were more optimistic toward income potential, pulling the index higher. Overall sentiment jumped among households with incomes in the bottom two-thirds of the distribution, while the top income bracket's confidence in the economy rose at a much slower pace.\n\n\"Since households with incomes in the top third account for more than half of all consumer expenditures, cautious observers will conclude that the latest data are another indication that the end of the expansion is on the distant horizon,\" said Richard Curtin, the survey's chief economist.\n\nAll income groups were more positive about growth prospects for the overall economy \u2014 a rebound following weaker-than-expected consumer sentiment reports in recent months.\n\nFinancial-market turmoil at the end of 2018, fading stimulus, and the partial government shutdown that ended in January have weighed on outlooks toward the economy. Sentiment in February made a modest recovery after falling to its lowest level since October 2016 a month earlier.\n\nBut consumers appear to have shaken off some of these strains, according to Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, with expectations for the future rising to just off the September high.\n\n\"This matters, because it strongly supports our view that the slowing in consumption in recent months is more likely to be a transition to a sustainable pace, as the kick from tax cuts and lower gas prices fades, rather than the start of a sustained downtrend, ultimately leading to the end of the cycle,\" he said.\n\nOn Tuesday, data showed optimism among small businesses rebounded last month after also falling to a more than two-year low.\n\n\"Small-business owners are thankful to have the government shutdown in the rear-view mirror but need more certainty about the future,\" said Juanita Duggan, the NFIB's president and CEO.",

    "title": "'He wanted it badder than anybody': The family Greedy Williams plays for",
    "description": "LSU's Williams is a top draft prospect with NFL riches ahead of him, but his involvement with football has already changed the lives of his family.",
    "text": "Former LSU cornerback Greedy Williams might be the best pure cover corner in the NFL draft, but will he be selected in the first round? (1:27)\n\nBATON ROUGE, La. -- It would be so much more fitting if Greedy Williams had earned his nickname on the football field.\n\nThat's where he gobbled up eight interceptions in two seasons to position himself as the latest first-round NFL draft talent to be churned out of LSU's cornerback factory.\n\nThat's also where he has an insatiable desire to be considered the best. When asked at the Tigers' pro day if he believes he is the top cornerback in this year's draft, Greedy replied with a big smile and an incredulous, \"What?! What?!\" before going into a speech about how the \"stats don't lie.\"\n\nAnd the football field is where Greedy has gone to work, hoping to use his talent to create a better life for his family -- including his 2-year-old daughter, Khloe, and his mother, Lakesha Williams, a single parent who raised four kids in some of the roughest neighborhoods of Shreveport, Louisiana, before she wound up marrying Greedy's youth football coach.\n\n\"Football changed my family's life,\" Greedy said.\n\nThe real story is that Andraez Williams became known as \"Greedy\" when he was 1 month old. That's when Lakesha's aunt started calling him \"Greedy Deedy\" because of the way he gulped through his full supply of bottles so quickly.\n\nBut it didn't take long before he started living up to the hype that comes with a name like that. As his coach-turned-stepfather, Lonnie Bryant, likes to say, Greedy was a \"shutdown corner\" from the time he started playing football at the age of 5. Even though teams didn't throw the ball much at that age, Bryant said they all liked to run wide around the edges. And none of them could get around Greedy.\n\n\"I knew his time would come, because he just wanted it. He wanted it badder than anybody,\" said Greedy's older brother, Rodarius, who plays cornerback at Oklahoma State. \"From him being that hard worker and wanting to be greedy -- he's got the perfect name, because he never gave up on anything.\"\n\n\"Football changed my family's life,\" said Greedy Williams, a projected first-round pick in April's draft. AP Photo/Gerald Herbert\n\nRodarius, who is one year older, naturally boasted that he always used to beat Greedy in everything from sports to video games, \"you name it.\" But he said that just led to Greedy nagging him with demands like, \"Let's try it again, let's do it again. You can't beat me this time. Play me again.\"\n\n\"If you see that passion in his eyes the first time he touched a football, man it was amazing,\" said Rodarius, who was nicknamed \"LeeLee\" growing up. \"We watched him from the house because they practiced outside the house. When we just watched him run up and down the field, I'm like, 'Is he really doing this?' He was just running all over the young guys.\"\n\nEven more amazing was the way Greedy's involvement with football wound up transforming the entire family.\n\nLakesha had her first daughter at age 14. And she doesn't try to sugarcoat what life was like for her, Greedy, Rodarius and sisters Keandre and Andrea.\n\n\"Single mother, young mother, on assistance from the government, housing assistance. We were just going from -- I guess I call it from one 'hood to another 'hood,\" said Lakesha, who described Greedy's biological father as being in and out of his life.\n\nBut Greedy's passion for football and early success in the sport gave the family something to rally around. Rodarius started playing soon after, too.\n\nplay 0:52 Top CB draft prospect Greedy Williams flashes confidence Top CB draft prospect Greedy Williams showed off his confidence, among other skills, at LSU's pro day Friday. When asked if he's the best cornerback in the draft, Williams smiled and replied, \"What?!\" Video by Mike Triplett.\n\nThen the biggest transformation came a few years later, when Lonnie became both a coach and father. \"I call Lonnie our hero,\" Lakesha said. \"Because he matured me, let me see the bigger picture, there's other things in life. We didn't know what going out of town was until we met him. So we were taking trips and getting into sports, and I got to learn about sports and got more involved.\n\n\"Along with Greedy -- I would say he's the hero, too. Because he'd look at the kids practicing football and said he wanted to play football, too. And I'd say from then on it changed our lives.\"\n\nNot only did they move into a better neighborhood together, but the boys credit Lonnie for helping teach them how to be men -- and to be fathers. (Rodarius is expecting his first daughter to be born this week.) Lonnie was also an anchor for the family when Lakesha battled cancer about 10 years ago. The rest of the family considers Lakesha a hero as well.\n\n\"She's been all of our rock. I don't know what I'd do without her ... I think at that time they needed me -- and I needed them. That slowed me down a little bit, because I became more of a family man,\" said Lonnie, who runs the Xpress Sports youth programs in Shreveport, where he also coached fellow LSU first-round draft prospect Devin White as a basketball player on Greedy's teams when they were in junior high.\n\n\"It's still kind of crazy to me. I don't even know how she did it, man,\" Rodarius said. \"Just from working at a hotel to taking care of four kids, day in and day out, making sure we had everything that we need. Man, she did a phenomenal job just staying on us and making sure we didn't end up like other people we were surrounded with, where we grew up from.\n\n\"I'm just lost for words, man. I still don't know how she did it.\"\n\nGreedy already bought his great grandmother her first set of new furniture recently, which touched Lakesha quite a bit. But he has even bigger plans for his mom once he gets his first signing bonus.\n\n\"That's my motivation right there,\" Greedy said. \"Just watching my mom struggle to get to work, to take care of four kids on her own. Just watching things like that as a kid just makes you want to be in this position where I'm at to be able to just give her the world.\n\n\"Give her anything she wants, because she definitely deserves it, how hard she worked for us.\"\n\nAs for Khloe, whose name is tattooed across the upper half of Greedy's back, she can have \"the whole [bank] account if she needs it.\"\n\nGreedy and White both have big plans to give back to the \"318,\" too, after they begin their promising NFL careers. The two of them have become close since they first met around age 12, each describing the other as a \"brother.\"\n\n\"I trust Greedy with my life, man,\" White said. \"If you cut him open, I might bleed. That's how close we are together. I'd give him the clothes off my back.\"\n\nGreedy, who is the No. 25 overall prospect in the draft, according to Scouts Inc., still has some odds to overcome, however, if they're both going to meet their goal of becoming top-10 picks.\n\nGreedy Williams ran the 40-yard dash in 4.37 seconds at the NFL combine. Brian Spurlock/USA TODAY Sports\n\nBack in January, ESPN draft analysis Mel Kiper Jr. had Greedy projected as the No. 4 overall pick in his first mock draft, comparing the 6-foot-2, 185-pounder to Aqib Talib. But earlier this week, Kiper had him all the way down at No. 29 in his latest mock draft, explaining, \"there are questions about his willingness to tackle and about his fluidity in coverage.\"\n\nGreedy, who was a second-team Associated Press All-American last season and a first-team selection by some other organizations, has heard questions about his tackling from NFL teams as well.\n\nBut his answer is that he wasn't asked to tackle that much as a man-to-man corner in college.\n\n\"I'm not scared to tackle,\" Greedy said. \"Look, I'm coming with full force. You put me in a Cover 2 zone, you'll see how I hit. Like I told the scouts, you put me in Cover 2 and that tight end runs in the zone, I'll show you what I can do.\"\n\nGreedy said he'll play wherever teams want him to line up. But he does consider man-to-man coverage his strength -- as he displayed in a signature performance last season against Ole Miss receiver D.K. Metcalf, among others.\n\n\"Man-to-man, I can shut anybody down,\" said Greedy, who described his bravado as \"who I am.\"\n\n\"A guy who can talk and back it up,\" Greedy said. \"I've got that confidence in me. If I say it, I've got to do it, I've got to prove it. So it's been proven.\"\n\nGreedy's 40-yard dash at the NFL scouting combine turned heads -- he tied for second among all cornerbacks with a time of 4.37 seconds. His other drills at LSU's pro day weren't quite as elite, but he said he was happy with his performance.\n\nNo matter where he gets drafted next month, Greedy and the Williams family are already an inspiring success story. All four of Lakesha's kids graduated high school, and three of them went to college -- the kind of life she wanted for them when she wasn't able to finish school.\n\nAnd now a family that once didn't \"know what going out of town was\" is planning to be together in Nashville, Tennessee, next month for the NFL draft.\n\n\"It doesn't feel real, really,\" Lakesha said. \"I'm just happy, I really am. I'm happy for him most of all, because he worked so hard for it.\n\n\"He deserves every moment, every spotlight. Whatever it is, he deserves it.\"",

Mr Trump had stated that he had repeatedly advised Ms May to go for a hard Brexit.\n\nMr Trump Jr, who holds no political office, has been in the news for being part of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation into Russian collusion which allegedly helped put the president in the White House.\n\nMr Murphy, seen as a rising star in the Democratic Party, is on a trip to the UK, Northern Ireland and Ireland, during which he is meeting ministers and politicians about \u201can alternative view\u201d from Washington to the Trump administration about Brexit.\n\nHe is meeting David Liddington, the minister for the Cabinet Office who has been described as Ms May\u2019s \u201cde-facto deputy prime minister\u201d, and MPs in London; politicians including DUP leaders in Belfast and Ireland\u2019s foreign minister Simon Coveney in Dublin.\n\nThe senator described Donald Jr\u2019s view as \u201cbonkers\u201d and wondered why any credence should be given to someone who is not a member of the administration and holds no elected office.\n\n\u201cI am not sure what the views of the president\u2019s children have to do with this,\u201d said Mr Murphy.\n\nTurning to Mr Trump, the senator continued there is a \u201cworry that the president\u2019s message is drowning out other perspectives coming from the United States\u201d.\n\nSpeaking of the president\u2019s call for a hard Brexit, he said: \u201cTrump has worked himself into a box where he is demanding a hard Brexit which would shatter the peace process, which would then quell any interest in congress to support a trade agreement with Britain. There\u2019s a circular firing squad here that the president has created.\n\n\u201cThe Irish American lobby, of which I am a member, is pretty powerful in the US. Unless there is certainty about how you\u2019re going to put off a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, there isn\u2019t going to be a lot of interest in congress in the US getting into a trade deal with Britain.\n\n\u201cThe head of the Committee on Overseas Trade in the House is Richie Neill, who is the most prominent member of the Irish American caucus and he [will] be asking lots of questions, you can be sure, about the peace process before anything happens.\u201d\n\nMr Murphy advised caution over Mr Trump\u2019s tweets promising a quick trade agreement with Britain: \u201cWe\u2019ve learnt not to pay too much attention to the president\u2019s Twitter feed. There is not a lot of connection between what he tweets and what he does.\n\n\u201cSo just because the president\u2019s tweeting that he\u2019s going to go gangbusters into a US-Britain trade deal doesn\u2019t mean that he\u2019s going to, nor does it mean congress will follow.\u201d\n\nThe senator also warned that London should not expect an easy ride in a Trump deal. The US will have great leverage in negotiations and use it to demand market access for farm products like chlorinated chicken now barred from Europe, he warned.\n\n\u201cTrump wants to negotiate with Britain because he can get stuff from Britain that he can\u2019t get from the EU. The administration believes it can get Britain to drop agricultural protections that it can\u2019t get Brussels to drop,\u201d he said.\n\nThe senator said there was \u201cbig bipartisan support for a trade relationship with Britain\u201d but also \u201cbig support for a relationship with the European Union ... We worry about the European Union if the US incentivises countries to leave and a trade agreement between the US and Britain comes before a trade agreement between the US and the European Union.\u201d\n\nDamage to the European Union would be \u201ca gift\u201d to Russia, held Mr Murphy. \u201cIt will be another quiver to their arrow, help them in weakening the EU. Russia is surreptitiously trying to get countries to leave the EU and if their message is that a bilateral free trade agreement with the US awaits upon departure from the EU, then it makes their case more persuasive.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I think congress is going to think very carefully about how to sequence these trade agreements, as a way to send a message to Russia that we stand with the EU,\u201d he commented.\n\nAsked about whether he supported a second referendum, Mr Murphy said he did not want to comment directly on an issue before parliament.\n\nBut, he continued: \u201cIt feels to me like a lot of people here want a second look at this with all this new information. If there\u2019s talk of a second referendum, I want to make sure that folks have all the information in front of them.\n\n\u201cThere is a feeling back home that maybe Britain leapt before it looked; maybe the way the US did [after the election] in 2016. There is a lot hand-wringing about the way the president conducts his business, a lot of folks wish they had their vote back. So it looks a bit familiar if we look at what\u2019s playing out here.\u201d\n\nMr Murphy pointed out that the US was also facing political upheaval with a prolonged standoff between the president and congress.\n\nHe added: \u201cOur crisis is a 30-day government shutdown and your crisis is total and utter confusion about how to leave the EU.\u201d\n\nAnd while Mr Trump may be a one-term president: \u201cBrexit is forever, in that way it\u2019s very different what\u2019s happening there and what\u2019s happening here.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s true.

    "title": "Trump\u2019s Budget Is a Disaster for the GOP",
    "description": "The President keeps trying to attack programs that are more popular than he is.",
    "text": "When you realize your budget is dead on arrival. Photo: MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images\n\nDonald Trump is nothing if not a man of vision \u2014 a destructive vision, to be sure, soaked in blood-and-soil nationalism and open contempt for the poor. He\u2019s not always so skilled at executing that vision, a failure aptly demonstrated by the fate of his first budget. The administration\u2019s most drastic proposals, which would have zeroed out funding for the Appalachian Regional Commission and the National Endowment for the Arts in addition to cuts to entitlement programs like SNAP, mostly didn\u2019t survive Congress. No president ever gets everything they want from a budget, but Trump\u2019s first effort was notable for the obvious, wide gap between it and political reality.\n\nTrump is a slow learner. His latest budget, released on Monday morning, closely resembles his inaugural attempt, as it, too, contains welfare cuts that are likely to create a public relations problem for the Republican Party. It probably won\u2019t fare any better than its predecessor, and it sets up a costly political battle for Republicans, who will have to convince voters, again, that they\u2019re motivated by something other than pure animus for the poor. They\u2019ll have a difficult time making themselves heard over the president\u2019s budget, which whittles down some of the most popular entitlement programs in the country partly to secure funding for his border fence.\n\nMedicaid, which provides health-care coverage to low-income beneficiaries, is one of the biggest losers in this year\u2019s budget. As reported by the Washington Post, the budget would cut Medicaid spending by $1.5 trillion over the next decade, end funding for Medicaid expansion, and allocate $1.2 trillion to a system that would allocate Medicaid funding in block grants to each state. The budget also suggests a per-person cap for Medicaid spending in addition to broad work requirements. Most experts agree that block granting Medicaid funding would, in practice, amount to spending cuts \u2014 and cuts aren\u2019t a new priority for the Trump administration. Under Trump, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reliably grants waivers to states whose legislators want to attach work requirements to Medicaid, even though that policy cuts thousands of low-income people from the program. Seema Verma, the administrator of CMS, has praised the waivers as a way for states to \u201cinnovate\u201d and reduce \u201cdependency\u201d on government aid. Similar language, promoting cuts as a path to \u201cself-sufficiency,\u201d appears in this year\u2019s budget.\n\nThe budget has more bad news for the poor. Able-bodied individuals who receive housing assistance from the Department of Housing and Urban Development would have to contribute more toward their rents; the non-elderly and able-bodied poor would also have to work or study at least 20 hours per week. Food assistance would be reduced, too. Not only does the budget propose cutting the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program by $220 billion over the next ten years, it revives the notion of America\u2019s Harvest Boxes, which the administration first floated in its 2019 budget proposal. Low-income families would receive boxes of government-purchased, nonperishable food items in lieu of an EBT card they can use at grocery stores. (A version of the Harvest Box program already exists: The Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations operates along similar lines, and research has shown that the food provided to reservations often doesn\u2019t meet the USDA\u2019s established nutritional standards.)\n\nWe already knew that Trump wants to cut welfare, so by that metric, the contents of today\u2019s budget aren\u2019t a surprise. But they provide further confirmation that the president is committed to shrinking the size of the government, even though many of his proposed cuts are dead in the water with Democrats in control of the House. Trump\u2019s budget won\u2019t survive Congress unscathed, and neither will his party.\n\nMonday\u2019s budget is also proof that the president has learned little from his party\u2019s recent legislative failures. Regarding Medicaid, the budget explicitly calls for \u201clegislation modeled after the Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson bill,\u201d a health-care bill that would have replaced the Affordable Care Act with a block grant program in 2017. Though Republicans controlled Congress, the bill was so draconian it never made it to Trump\u2019s desk. And that was a compromise bill, designed to fulfill the GOP\u2019s promise to repeal and replace the ACA with something more palatable than its previous attempts at legislation. The American Health Care Act, which would have replaced the ACA with legislation that didn\u2019t include protections for people with preexisting conditions, polled so abysmally that the party abandoned it, too. According to one Quinnipiac poll, only 21 percent of Americans approved of the AHCA. Medicaid, meanwhile, tends to be very popular, and so does Medicaid expansion.\n\nTrump has risked another government shutdown over politically unpopular provisions that won\u2019t even get the full support of his party. It\u2019s a bizarre blunder, and one that probably reveals the extent to which the president and members of his administration have become blinded by their own hostility to welfare.",

Considering the average card annual percentage rate, or APR, is hovering at a record high of over 17 percent, it can take quite a while to dig out from under and start saving again.\n\n\u201cI see people getting into cycles where they\u2019re in debt and they get a tax return, they don\u2019t save any of it, then incur more debt,\u201d says Dr. Moira Somers, clinical neuropsychologist, professor, executive coach and author of \u201cAdvice That Sticks: How to Give Financial Advice That People Will Follow,\u201d based in Winnipeg, Canada.\n\nAside from high interest rates, credit cards can be dangerous for those looking to save money because a little too easy to forget how much we owe until the bill comes in. \u201cPaying with credit cards isn\u2019t even perceived by our brain as spending,\u201d explains Somers. \u201cThere\u2019s an area of the brain associated with pleasure and anticipation, and an area associated by disgust and pain. When you put people in brain imaging scanners, and they go through scenarios imagining they are making a purchase and paying with cash and credit, both areas light up when they paid with cash. But when they paid with credit cards, only the pleasure area lit up. That\u2019s why casinos move us away from anything that looks like money. You used to feed tokens and nickels into slot machines. Now people just put it on a thing that looks like a credit card because it doesn\u2019t feel like money,\u201d she said.\n\nColin F. Camerer, Robert Kirby Professor of Behavioral Economics at Caltech and director of the T&C Chen Center for Social and Decision Neuroscience says people don\u2019t \u201cintuitively compute\u201d how fast credit card interest can multiply. \u201cThere\u2019s still a lot of temptation to spend compared to the temptation to save,\u201d he explains.\n\nIt's no wonder one very recent study showed love to be analogous to money in the human brain. After comparing how the brain works when facing incentives for goal-directed behaviors, researchers found \u201cthe common involvement of brain regions in both social and material reward anticipation.\u201d In other words, neuroscientifically, the same brain circuitry in that makes us feel positive and motivated reacts in the same way to money as it does to love.\n\nConversely, we might jokingly call unforeseen expenses \u2018a pain in the wallet,\u2019 but neuroscience says there\u2019s some truth to that sentiment. As it turns out, a study similar to what Somers referred to found the same brain circuitry to activate when we anticipate financial loss as it does when we experience pain.\n\nMake These Shifts to Save More Money\n\nSo, if it's true that some of us may equate money with love and deny that credit is actually cash, how can we retrain our brains to save money instead of succumb to the urge to rush out and spend it? Here's what the experts had to say:\n\nPay with cash. Somers says using cash instead of credit to pay for discretionary items (like clothing, food and entertainment) can reduce spending by as much as 20 - 28 percent, because having to fork over actual cash makes the brain pause to give these purchases a second thought.\n\nAutomate your savings. \u201cFor the sake of your future self, arrange for whatever percentage you can save to be put into a retirement or savings vehicle, be it a 401k, Roth IRA, or a savings account,\u201d says Somers. \u201cAnother thing I always suggest is a separate periodic savings account for things like holidays, the annual house insurance and taxes. It\u2019s easy to forget about them unless they are just on your doorstep, so being prepared really helps.\u201d\n\nDo an annual money cleanse. Camerer advises taking a day, at least once a year, to closely examine the auto-debits on your credit card bills through a magnifying glass and trimming expenses you might\u2019ve forgotten about or don\u2019t need any more. \u201cYou may notice monthly subscriptions that are wants, not needs. People are more adaptive than they might think about making do on a little less,\u201d he says.\n\nCurb time spent at the mall time and watching lifestyle TV. Sure, the lavish lives of the Real Housewives may be the ultimate guilty pleasure, but they can also tempt you into wanting luxury items that are above your means. The same goes for doing the \u201cmall shuffle,\u201d says Somers. \u201cThe longer people spend shopping, the more likely they are to start spending unconsciously. You get tired and your decision-making abilities kind of fade over time. You just start picking stuff up because it\u2019s there and buying it,\u201d she says.",

    "title": "Founder of Alleged Rub-and-Tug Spa Now Sells Access to Trump",
    "description": "A Florida spa-chain owner has been offering Chinese executives the opportunity to rub shoulders with Trump and White House officials at Mar-a-Lago.",
    "text": "Cindy Yang and President Trump in a photo signed by Trump, which Yang posted on Facebook. Photo: Facebook/Screencap via The Miami Herald\n\nThe woman who founded the Florida spa where police allege Patriots owner Robert Kraft solicited prostitution appears to have also sold access to the president, according to investigations by the Miami Herald and Mother Jones. The reports not only raise another red flag about how political influence has been monetized during the Trump presidency, but provide new evidence of how Trump-branded properties have become magnets for corruption and grift \u2014 and may soon lead to new investigations into what may have been illegal campaign donations to Trump and the RNC.\n\nWho Is Cindy Yang?\n\nAt the center of this developing story is Cindy (Li) Yang, a 45-year-old entrepreneur and naturalized U.S. citizen from China who started fundraising for Trump in 2017. Yang and her family members founded a chain of Asian day spas in Florida, mostly under the Tokyo Day Spa brand. One of the spas Yang founded but later sold was the Orchids of Asia spa in Jupiter, Florida, where police say they filmed billionaire Robert Kraft paying for oral sex in late January as part of a multi-agency law-enforcement operation targeting human trafficking at spas in the state. Ten Asian day spas were ultimately raided and shut down as a result of that investigation, but Orchids of Asia was the only one associated with Yang.\n\nAccording to the Miami Herald, there is no indication that Yang was implicated in the sting. However, the Herald reports that many of the day spas she and her family have owned and operated, including the location which later became Orchids of Asia, at the time Yang still ran it, have earned reputations as so-called rub-and-tug parlors, where sexual services are sold to clients in addition to massage.\n\nYang and her family members have opened at least six day spas as well as a massage school and several nail salons \u2014 all in Palm Beach and Broward counties. \u201cThe family\u2019s Tokyo Day Spa branches have attracted the attention of at least two local police agencies over allegations of prostitution, and are discussed online as places where men can pay for sexual extras,\u201d the Herald reported on Friday. The publication dug through Yelp and websites aimed at would-be patrons of rub-and-tug businesses, and noted allegations from former employees and customers:\n\nOnline ads on obscure websites also raise flags about Yang\u2019s businesses. In an ad written in Chinese recruiting masseuses, Yang stated that anyone over the age of 45 need not apply. Phone numbers associated with members of the Yang family are connected to various apparently old online advertisements for more explicit sex services.\n\nThe Herald reported on Friday that Yang denied that she or her family members had done anything illegal, but did not respond when asked whether they were aware of allegations that sexual services were being sold at their businesses. She also said she wanted to avoid negative press ahead of her upcoming move \u2014 to Washington.\n\nFrom massage to MAGA\n\nIf there is any evidence that Cindy Yang had an interest in politics before the 2016 presidential race, the Miami Herald couldn\u2019t find it. She hadn\u2019t voted in ten years, but then seemed to undergo some kind of political awakening. She made some small donations to Jeb Bush\u2019s presidential campaign in 2015 and talked about starting a \u201cnew life\u201d in a Facebook post from a GOP women\u2019s event in 2016. But then, she started posting more and more about politics on social media as the general election played out. She also removed her name from the business records of the spas she founded, and had founded what the Herald characterized as a disorganized charity called the Overseas International Female Organization.\n\nWithin a year of Trump\u2019s election, Yang was deep in the MAGA muck. She had been to Trump\u2019s inauguration, a fancy New York fundraiser, an elite lunch at Mar-a-Lago, and she had started fundraising for the president. She had also started amassing a large collection of photos of herself with Trump, Trump family members, Trump administration officials, Republican lawmakers, and conservative personalities.\n\nAnd still more. Here are photos of Cindy (Li) Yang with Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao and another of Chao with Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, both members of President Trump's cabinet. https://t.co/xrqjKVlL2n pic.twitter.com/hd2EMeJwck \u2014 Christal Hayes (@Journo_Christal) March 9, 2019\n\nSince 2017, Yang and family members have donated almost $60,000 to the Trump campaign and the Trump Victory super-PAC, and she has frequented Mar-a-Lago, where she recently took a selfie with the president during the club\u2019s Super Bowl party. She\u2019s also been to the White House, where she attended a meeting of Trump\u2019s Asian American and Pacific Islander Initiative in February 2018. She has apparently attended at least two other events hosted by the group in Washington, as well.\n\nYang\u2019s Trumpmania may not have been all about MAGA, however, as she didn\u2019t just obtain access, but has tried to profit from it.\n\nSelling the presidential selfie in China\n\nA little more than a year after Trump\u2019s election, Yang and her husband started a consulting firm, GY US Investments, targeting Chinese businesses looking to expand their operations in the U.S. The company\u2019s website marketed Yang\u2019s connections to Trump, his administration, and his conservative allies. To prove that point, the site featured numerous photos of Yang posing with Trump, Trump family members, White House officials and various other Republicans and conservative personalities.\n\nSome more pics from Cindy (Li) Yang's consulting business site: Photo with President Trump, Trump's campaign manager Brad Parscale, Rep. Brian Mast and Adam Putnam, who was in the heat of campaigning for Florida governor at the time. https://t.co/xrqjKVlL2n pic.twitter.com/QExh7rcGFJ \u2014 Christal Hayes (@Journo_Christal) March 9, 2019\n\nAccording to Mother Jones, \u201cthe overall message conveyed by the GY US Investments website seems clear: hire Yang\u2019s company and she can get you close to Trump and his government \u2014 at Mar-a-Lago and in Washington.\u201d The GY site, which went offline after the Herald story broke but can still be seen in archived form, claimed that the firm had arranged attendance and photo opportunities for clients at the White House\u2019s \u201cAsian New Year\u201d celebration in 2018, had gotten \u201ca number of guests\u201d into the annual New Year\u2019s Eve bash at Mar-a-Lago this year, and teased more opportunities to come:\n\nThe GY US Investments website lists upcoming events at Mar-a-Lago at which Yang\u2019s clients presumably can mingle with Trump or members of his family. This includes something called the International Leaders Elite Forum, where Trump\u2019s sister, Elizabeth Trump Grau, will supposedly be the featured speaker. Attendees, the site says, will include \u201cChinese elites from various countries, including the US states, as well as elite leaders from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, Australia, Europe and other countries and regions.\u201d Another event for which Yang\u2019s firm says it can provide access is Trump\u2019s annual New Year\u2019s celebration at Mar-a-Lago. Elsewhere on the website, the firm boasts that \u201cGY Company arranged a number of guests to attend the 2019 New Year\u2019s Eve dinner. All the guests took photos with\u201d members of Trump\u2019s family. This page displays photos of Chinese executives and a Chinese movie star with Donald Trump Jr., suggesting that these pics were arranged by the company, and also includes a photo of Yang with Elizabeth Trump Grau.\n\nCoupled next to a photo of Mar-a-Lago, here's how Cindy Yang's business consulting website describes some of its services and how it can help you connect with President Trump and his cabinet:\n\n\n\nStory - https://t.co/xrqjKVlL2n pic.twitter.com/Jrl43Gwa6j \u2014 Christal Hayes (@Journo_Christal) March 9, 2019\n\nThe first Trump event Yang may have sold access to was in late 2017. On Saturday, the Miami Herald reported that Yang had attended a fundraiser on December 7 at Cipriani New York, and was accompanied by a group of Chinese business executives. She said the foreigners were her \u201cguests,\u201d according to one of the attendees:\n\nIn the 11 days before the event, Yang gave $5,400 to Trump\u2019s campaign and $23,500 to the Trump Victory political action committee, according to a Miami Herald analysis of federal political contributions. [Yang] also claimed to have arranged the presence of a large group of business people from mainland China.\n\nNearly 100 of the 400 or so guests at the New York fundraiser were Chinese, according to Chinese-language media reports at the time. Even Trump noted the disproportion at the event, according to the Herald:\n\nThe source who attended the party said the president joked that the Chinese guests got all the good seats and would be omnipresent at future events if his American friends in real estate didn\u2019t start donating more. The source said admission started at $2,700, and photos with the president were offered for $10,000.\n\nTen days after the event, Yang and her husband registered GY US Investments as a company in Florida and began marketing her access.\n\nYang\u2019s company is promoting an upcoming event at Mar-a-Lago featuring Trump\u2019s sister, Elizabeth Trump Grau. The co. bills it as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime publicity opportunity\u201d where \"Chinese elites\" will have the chance to mingle with Trump Grau and members of Congress pic.twitter.com/5iCxZXqkVA \u2014 Daniel Schulman (@DanielSchulman) March 9, 2019\n\nDid Yang break the law?\n\nIt\u2019s not yet clear. Since U.S. election law only allows American citizens and permanent residents to contribute money to a U.S. politician, foreigners can only attend political fundraisers if they do not pay their way in. If Yang paid for a foreign citizen\u2019s ticket, but was reimbursed by them \u2014 thus acting as a conduit for foreign donations \u2014 that would be illegal.\n\nMimi Rocah, a former federal prosecutor with the Southern District of New York, commented on Saturday that a law-enforcement investigation may now be an inevitability. She explained that there seemed to be \u201ca lot of potential criminal conduct\u201d in the reports, and the next step, she said, was to find out how and why Yang had access, predicting that, \u201cI see subpoenas in her future.\u201d\n\nReached for comment about her businesses and Trump connections by the Miami Herald, Cindy Yang said she did not know the president personally or work for him, but has volunteered with the Trump campaign:\n\n\u201cI just come to some events. There\u2019s nothing special,\u201d Yang said. Although she has claimed online to be a member of Trump clubs, she told the Herald she does not in fact belong to any.\n\nIs this a national security risk?\n\nSam Vinograd, who served on President Obama\u2019s National Security Council, speculated on Saturday that it was very likely China, thanks to its counterintelligence strength, knew about Yang\u2019s access, and may have even directed it. Another national security expert, Lawfare\u2019s Susan Hennessey made a similar point.\n\nOn Sunday, Mother Jones reported that Yang was an officer in two groups with links to China\u2019s government, though stressed there was no evidence to suggest she was involved in espionage. According to the report, an online profile of Yang said she held senior roles in Florida local branches of the (American) Chinese Association of Science and Technology and the Council for the Promotion of the Peaceful Reunification of China (CPPRC). Both organizations have numerous U.S. chapters, and don\u2019t at all prove that Yang was some kind of government agent, but they are still organizations which are linked to China\u2019s Communist Party, and at least one, the CPPRC, is meant to help promote Chinese influence. Mother Jones also notes that Yang was once invited to attend a ceremony welcoming three warships as they docked in Florida \u2014 an event which was also attended by China\u2019s ambassador to the U.S. and consul general.\n\nWhat about blackmail?\n\nAnother potential security risk revolves around sex work that may have been performed at Yang\u2019s day spas, as well as their proximity to Trump\u2019s southern White House \u2014 Mar-a-Lago. What if, as the Daily Beast\u2019s David Rothkopf loudly worried on Saturday, Trump or members of his inner circle have been customers at any of the spas operated by Yang and her family. Billionaire Trump friend Robert Kraft allegedly was. And billionaire Trump backer John Childs allegedly paid for sexual services at a different Asian day spa caught up in the same sting.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be a spy novelist to imagine the blackmail opportunities such a situation could create. There are no indications that any other Trumpworld figures were spa clients, but no one should be surprised if Trump\u2019s tabloid presidency gets somehow crazier, or sleazier.\n\nIs anyone else trying to sell White House access in China?\n\nYang, of course, is only the latest specific example of the gold rush of influence seekers and peddlers who have tried to work their way into Trump\u2019s orbit since he was elected president. In the half-exploded ethical minefield of the Trump administration, concerns over executives and foreigners using Trump family businesses to gain access and influence within the White House have been repeatedly justified. Just this past week, ProPublica reported that a Mar-a-Lago member was able to get Trump to forward his personal policy idea to the head of the Veterans Administration \u2014 hardly the first or last time that will happen before Trump leaves office.\n\nJust two weeks ago, Bolsonaro's son, a Congressman in Brazil, hung out at Mar-a-Lago where he celebrated @realDonaldTrump and said, \"Build that wall! Brazilians are supporting you!\u201d\n\n\n\nVia @1100Penn: https://t.co/VNoooHQs1I https://t.co/rGvdDzsg8D \u2014 Zach Everson (@Z_Everson) March 9, 2019\n\nWhen it comes to obtaining access to Trump events, Yang\u2019s company has been just one of at least several options for interested parties in China. Last May, the Washington Post highlighted the rising number of well-off Chinese citizens who were attending Trump fundraisers. They reported that official-looking offer letters had made the rounds among wealthy businesspeople in China offering chances to meet Trump at a campaign fundraising event in Dallas for as much as $100,000. The Post even tracked down the source of that offer, and heard about tactics which seem somewhat similar to Yang\u2019s:\n\nIn an interview with The Washington Post, a Beijing man who claims to be an organizer of the excursion to Dallas said he coordinated a previous U.S. trip, bringing members of the Chinese business elite to snap selfies and pose for photos at a swanky Manhattan fund-raiser headlined by Trump in December. As part of his promotional materials for the Dallas trip, the man circulated pictures of wealthy Chinese business leaders, including a businessman known as the country\u2019s first owner of a Ferrari, standing shoulder to shoulder with Trump in formal wear and giving a thumbs-up. \u2026\n\nSun\u2019s invite claims that he and his associates have \u201cprior experience participating in three Republican president dinners in 2017,\u201d including the New York visit. The Post could not independently verify his involvement in any trips. In the interview, he said his Beijing-based company aims to raise the profile of Chinese entrepreneurs. The $100,000 per-person price tag includes airport pickup, lodging, meals and translator, the invitation says.\n\nThe RNC, in their response to the Post\u2019s story, denied having any knowledge of the efforts to woo Chinese nationals and said they would not have endorsed them if they had. \u201cWe maintain strict compliance with the law and have a zero-tolerance policy toward anyone who attempts to take advantage of the system in order to attend our events,\u201d an RNC spokeswoman said.\n\nThere have also been suspicions about presidency leveraging in China from someone with the closest possible ties to Trump. Jared Kushner was reportedly aggressively pursued by China\u2019s government after Trump got elected, and his family business was caught, more than once, using his connection to Trump to attract investment in the country.\n\nForeign citizens can spend as much as they want at Trump properties. At a typically Trump-attended event like the New Year\u2019s gala at Mar-a-Lago, the money just goes to Trump\u2019s company, not his campaign or the GOP. Trump did not attend the New Year\u2019s event at Mar-a-Lago this year, having decided to remain at the White House during his partial shutdown of the federal government. If he\u2019d gone, he may have run into Huachu Tang, the owner of an electric car company in China, who later told Yahoo Finance that he\u2019d made the trip from China with his wife in the hope of meeting Trump and raising the profile of his soon-to-be-public company. It\u2019s not clear if Tang was a client of Yang\u2019s firm or not. He said he had arranged the trip through a PR agency. Stood up by the president, Tang scored photos with Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, and the president\u2019s sister, instead.\n\nThis is Huachu Tang, owner of a Chinese electric car co., who flew 17 hours to attend the New Year's celebration at Mar-a-Lago in hopes of promoting his company. pic.twitter.com/Ajz6zHfZsR \u2014 Daniel Schulman (@DanielSchulman) March 9, 2019\n\nTang\u2019s company, when asked by Yahoo, declined to reveal how much he had paid to attend the event. According to the Palm Beach Post, Mar-a-Lago raised its prices for the party this year, and a pair of nonmember guests could expect to pay the Trump Organization as much as $2,500 to attend. We don\u2019t know who else was there, either. The Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics watchdog group has sued to gain access to Mar-a-Lago\u2019s visitor logs, but so far to no avail.\n\nThis post has been updated throughout to reflect new information and context.",

    "description": "Trump moves to cut aid to Central America, amid caravans and flood of refugees Fox News Trump 'will do everything he can' for security: Mulvaney on threat to close border ABC News US-Mexico border: Migrants held as Trump threatens closure - BBC News Cengiz Ad\u2026",
    "text": "Making good on a longstanding threat, President Trump moved this weekend to cut direct aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, whose citizens are fleeing north and overwhelming U.S. resources -- including as part of organized caravans that the White House has warned may eventually lead to the closure of the entire southern border with Mexico.\n\nThe dramatic step comes just days after Mexican Interior Secretary Olga Sanchez Cordero warned ominously that \"the mother of all caravans\" could be coming soon from the three nations.\n\n\"We have information that a new caravan is forming in Honduras, that they're calling 'the mother of all caravans,' and they are thinking it could have more than 20,000 people,\" Sanchez Cordero said Wednesday. A much smaller group of approximately 40 migrants left over the weekend, and a separate caravan of nearly 2,500 is currently making its way through Mexico.\n\nOBAMA DHS CHIEF ADMITS 'CRISIS' AT SOUTHERN BORDER\n\nAnd former Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson acknowledged Saturday that America has a \u201ccrisis\u201d at the southern border, and that the number of apprehensions exceed anything he encountered during his time serving under former President Barack Obama.\n\nLast December, the U.S. pledged more than $10B in aid to Central America and Mexico to help keep migrants put. Later that month, Trump tweeted: \"..Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are doing nothing for the United States but taking our money. Word is that a new Caravan is forming in Honduras and they are doing nothing about it. We will be cutting off all aid to these 3 countries -- taking advantage of U.S. for years!\"\n\nOn Saturday, the State Department put those words into action, and notified Congress that it would look to suspend 2017 and 2018 payments to the trio of nations, which have been home to some of the migrant caravans that have marched through Mexico to the U.S. border.\n\nIn tweets posted Saturday, Trump blamed Democrats and Mexico for problems at the border and beyond, saying progressives are concerned only with changing domestic demographics to ensure more liberal voters.\n\n\"It would be so easy to fix our weak and very stupid Democrat inspired immigration laws,\" Trump tweeted Saturday. \"In less than one hour, and then a vote, the problem would be solved. But the Dems don't care about the crime, they don't want any victory for Trump and the Republicans, even if good for USA!'\n\nAs far as Mexico's role, he tweeted: \"Mexico must use its very strong immigration laws to stop the many thousands of people trying to get into the USA. Our detention areas are maxed out & we will take no more illegals. Next step is to close the Border! This will also help us with stopping the Drug flow from Mexico!\"\n\nThe move comes as Trump, newly vindicated after the conclusion of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's Russia collusion probe, vowed to secure the borders and halt incoming caravans during a fiery rally earlier in the week.\n\nWhen reporters asked Trump on Friday what closing the border could entail, he said \"it could mean all trade\" with Mexico and added, \"We will close it for a long time.\"\n\nTrump has been promising for more than two years to build a long, impenetrable wall along the border to stop illegal immigration, though Congress has been reluctant to provide the money he needs. In the meantime, he has repeatedly threatened to close the border, but this time, with a new group of migrants heading north, he gave a definite timetable and suggested a visit to the border within the next two weeks.\n\nA substantial closure could have an especially heavy impact on cross-border communities from San Diego to South Texas, as well as supermarkets that sell Mexican produce, factories that rely on imported parts, and other businesses across the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. and Mexico trade about $1.7 billion in goods daily, according to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which said closing the border would be \"an unmitigated economic debacle\" that would threaten 5 million American jobs.\n\nNew Jersey Democrat Sen. Bob Menendez, the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, spoke out Saturday against cutting off aid to Central America, declaring that \"foreign assistance is not charity; it advances our strategic interests and funds initiatives that protect American citizens.\"\n\nAnd a group of House Democrats visiting El Salvador denounced the administration's decision to cut aid to the region.\n\n\"As we visit El Salvador evaluating the importance of U.S. assistance to Central America to address the root causes of family and child migration, we are extremely disappointed to learn that President Trump intends to cut off aid to the region,\" said the statement from five lawmakers, including Rep. Eliot L. Engel of New York, who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Committee. \"The President's approach is entirely counterproductive.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has threatened before to scale back or cut off U.S. assistance to Central America. Congress has not approved most of those proposed cuts, however, and a report this year by the Congressional Research Service said any change in that funding would depend on what Congress does.\n\nMEXICO WARNS OF IMPENDING 'MOTHER OF ALL CARAVANS'\n\nShort of a widespread border shutdown, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said the U.S. might close designated ports of entry to re-deploy staff to help process parents and children. Ports of entry are official crossing points that are used by residents and commercial vehicles.\n\nMany people who cross the border illegally ultimately request asylum under U.S. law, which does not require asylum seekers to enter at an official crossing. Most people who make asylum claims are eventually rejected, because asylum applicants must show a specific and credible fear of persecution -- it is not enough to merely claim that conditions back home are economically dire.\n\nBorder officials are also reportedly planning to more than quadruple the number of asylum seekers sent back over the border to wait out their immigration cases, from 60 to nearly 250.\n\nMexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Friday his country was doing its part to fight migrant smuggling. Criminal networks charge thousands of dollars a person to move migrants through Mexico, increasingly in large groups toward remote sections of the border.\n\n\"We want to have a good relationship with the government of the United States,\" Lopez Obrador said. He added: \"We are going to continue helping so that the migratory flow, those who pass through our country, do so according to the law, in an orderly way.\"\n\nMarcelo Ebrard, Mexico's foreign relations secretary, tweeted that his country \"doesn't act based on threats\" and is \"the best neighbor\" the U.S. could have.\n\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAlejandra Mier y Teran, executive director of the Otay Mesa Chamber of Commerce in San Diego, said the mere threat of border closures sends the wrong message to businesses in Mexico and may eventually scare companies into turning to Asia for their supply chains.\n\n\"I think the impact would be absolutely devastating on so many fronts,\" said Mier y Teran, whose members rely on the Otay Mesa crossing to bring televisions, medical devices and a wide range of products to the U.S. \"In terms of a long-term effect, it's basically shooting yourself in your foot. It's sending out a message to other countries that, 'Don't come because our borders may not work at any time.' That is extremely scary and dangerous.\"\n\nFox News' Griff Jenkins and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

    "text": "Washington (CNN) The Trump administration is headed for a budget clash with Congress, with calls for deep domestic spending cuts that lawmakers are likely to ignore as the nation's debt reaches record levels.\n\nOn Monday, President Donald Trump is set to deliver his budget roadmap with a promise to balance the budget in 15 years, marking the first time he'll unveil a spending proposal under a divided government with Speaker Nancy Pelosi at the helm of a Democratic-controlled House, and he is expected to face fierce resistance to severe proposed cuts on education, health and environmental protections.\n\nThe White House is proposing $2.7 trillion in spending cuts, according to new details released Sunday evening, following a directive by the President to reduce spending by 5% across federal agencies, except for defense spending, as part of its budget plan for fiscal year 2020, which begins on October 1. The proposed cuts come just as Congress will need to decide -- yet again this year -- whether to lift spending caps put into place by law in 2011.\n\n\"Our national debt nearly doubled under the previous administration and now stands at more than $22 trillion,\" said Russell Vought, acting director of the Office of Budget and Management, in a statement previewing the President's budget details. \"This budget shows that we can return to fiscal sanity without halting our economic resurgence while continuing to invest in critical priorities.\"\n\nLong term policy projections, according to the White House, show that policy proposals in the budget would put the US on track to balance the budget by 2034.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, a White House official confirmed Trump will ask for $8.6 billion for a border wall, and an additional $3.6 billion in military construction funds to pay back monies that the administration hopes will be spent this year that the President redirected by executive authority.\n\nPelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Sunday that Trump will not get the $8.6 billion he plans to request for the wall.\n\n\"President Trump hurt millions of Americans and caused widespread chaos when he recklessly shut down the government to try to get his expensive and ineffective wall, which he promised would be paid for by Mexico. Congress refused to fund his wall and he was forced to admit defeat and reopen the government. The same thing will repeat itself if he tries this again. We hope he learned his lesson,\" the two said in a joint statement.\n\nKentucky Democratic Rep. John Yarmuth, chairman of the House Budget Committee, said Sunday evening in a statement to CNN that the President's budget has \"no chance in the House.\"\n\n\"President Trump added nearly $2 trillion to our deficits with tax cuts for the wealthy and large corporations, and now it appears his budget asks the American people to pay the price,\" said Yarmuth. \"With severe cuts to essential programs and services that would leave our nation less safe and secure, the Trump budget is as dangerous as it is predictable.\"\n\nCongress holds the purse strings of what the government is willing to spend, and Democrats demonstrated their ability to stay unified during the partial government shutdown.\n\nHouse Financial Services Chairwoman Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, said at a hearing last week that she would fight to ensure robust funding for critical programs overseen by the committee, including reversing steps by the administration to weaken the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\n\"The Trump administration has also consistently put forth budget proposals that make massive cuts to programs that protect the nation's most vulnerable families,\" Waters said.\n\nThe President's new budget will prioritize funding for ending the opioid epidemic, a top priority for the Trump administration, investing in students to receive a high-quality education, modernizing the federal government's antiquated technology along with $80 billion for veteran care.\n\nTrump has previously proposed deep spending cuts on domestic programs as well as entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security every year of his presidency, and each time Congress has ignored them.\n\nThe White House official notes that the forthcoming request for wall funding is different than in previous years when the White House asked for wall money from just one funding source: the Department of Homeland Security (more specifically, CBP). This year, the White House will ask for $5 billion from Customs and Border Protection, but will also request $3.6 billion in military construction funds from the Pentagon.\n\nIn addition, the budget contains a request for another $3.6 billion in military construction funds -- but these would be used to \"backfill\" what the administration hopes to spend this year as a result of the emergency declaration. In other words, the White House is requesting money to pay back the funds that Trump redirected with executive authority, and officials are not counting that sum in the topline number they say they're requesting for the wall (at least $8.6 billion).\n\nThe amount of the wall request was first reported by Reuters\n\nTraditionally, the White House releases its budget proposal to Congress by the first Monday in February, but it was delayed this year due to the shutdown.\n\nIn late February, Trump's acting budget chief Vought previewed in an op-ed \"historic\" cuts in discretionary spending and rolled out plans to employ a war contingency fund as a maneuver to get around the defense budget limit.\n\n\"The level of borrowing is unsustainable, and is one of the largest threats to our nation's economic future,\" Vought wrote in the op-ed.\n\nIt's been unclear whether the 5% cut would be in addition to a 9% cut that would be forced by the budget caps set to kick in for the 2020 fiscal year.\n\nMick Mulvaney, the former chief at the Office of Management Budget who is now the White House acting chief of staff, was a major opponent of what's known as the Overseas Contingency Operations to make up for the cuts to the base defense budget.\n\nMulvaney, a self-proclaimed deficit hawk, has more recently relented when it comes to efforts by the administration to balance the budget and crack down on federal spending. Instead, the administration has pledged to balance the budget within a 10-year budget window.\n\nDuring his 2017 confirmation hearing for the OMB role, Mulvaney told lawmakers \"he look(ed) forward to having an opportunity to explain to the President why I think it is not a good way to spend American taxpayer dollars.\"\n\nDemocrats have already denounced the administration's maneuver as a budget \"gimmick\" that would obscure the true costs of the military operations and shortchange other national priorities.\n\n\"Rather than being honest and responsible about his budgeting, the President is choosing to deceive the American public yet again,\" said Yarmuth, chairman of the House Budget Committee, and House Armed Services Chairman Adam Smith, a Washington Democrat, in a joint statement in response to Vought's op-ed.\n\nThe President's budget is also expected to include a $100 million for the Women's Global Development and Prosperity Initiative, a White House official told CNN.\n\nThe President's daughter, Ivanka Trump , led the creation of the initiative, which was announced last month.\n\nThe debate on spending and budget caps will also inevitably intertwine with negotiations to raise the debt ceiling, which kicked back in on March 2.\n\nThe ceiling was initially intended to control spending by the federal government, but instead Congress has continued to approve increases to accommodate continued borrowing.\n\nAnd even though the country reached its debt limit, the Congressional Budget Office estimates Treasury will be able to pay its bills through the fall of 2019.\n\nDemocrats for the last two years have blasted Trump's tax cuts for increasing the federal deficit, which the CBO projects will surpass $1 trillion by 2020.\n\nCritics of the President's backed tax cut say it will add an additional $1.9 trillion to the nation's debt. Last year, Trump also reluctantly signed a massive $1.3 trillion spending bill after Democrats pushed for bigger budgets for health and education in exchange for a boost in military spending.\n\nThe White House has claimed that the tax cuts will pay for themselves and have been a driving factor in boosting the US economy, and blamed Democrats for the rising deficit after pushing for spending increases last year.\n\nTrump's budget proposal also comes ahead of yet another major fiscal issue that Congress will have to face this year. Lawmakers will need to decide how to resolve the remaining years of spending caps required under the Budget Control Act of 2011.\n\nThe law set caps on the government's discretionary spending for a 10-year period. It also included separate limits on defense and non-defense spending that would be triggered by automatic, across-the-board spending cuts.\n\nUnless Congress acts to raise them this year, the $647 billion limit on regular defense spending will drop by $71 billion, or an 11% cut, before adjusting for inflation. The non-discretionary spending cap would fall to $542 billion, or 9%.\n\nLawmakers have repeatedly -- in 2013, 2015 and 2018 -- chosen to raise the caps on spending in two-year increments.\n\n\"This is not sustainable or responsible,\" said Yarmuth at a House Budget hearing earlier this week. \"We need to raise the caps, for both defense and non-defense spending, to ensure that every American family has the chance to build a better future.\"",

    "description": "\"Votes for Women: A Portrait of Persistence\" at Washington's National Portrait Gallery highlights the key figures and moments in the decades-long fight for women's voting rights.",
    "text": "Written by Bridey Heing, CNN\n\nAt Washington's National Portrait Gallery, the centennial of the 19th Amendment, which gave men and women equal voting rights, is being marked by \"Votes for Women: A Portrait of Persistence,\" a comprehensive exhibition that highlights the key figures and moments in the decades-long fight for women's voting rights.\n\nOriginally set to open on March 1 (it was delayed by the recent government shutdown, which shuttered the Smithsonian network of museums), the exhibition tells part of the complex story of how we reached where we are today, throwing into relief the struggle for women's suffrage and the place of women's voices within the politics of the last century.\n\n\"Liberty and Her Attendants (Suffragettes Tableau),\" staged in front of the Treasury Building in Washington in 1913. Credit: Courtesy Ronnie Lapinsky Sax\n\nSpaced over six rooms and a corridor, \"Votes for Women\" includes 124 objects -- from photographic portraits to pennants and posters -- that curator Kate Clarke Lemay found in museums and private collections across the country. The famed purple, white and yellow banners carried by suffragists are featured alongside artworks created by women involved in the movement, photographs of women who ran for the presidency as early as the mid-1800s, and a video installation that uses images from the National Women's Party.\n\nLucy Burns -- seen here in jail in 1917 -- was imprisioned six times while protesting for women's rights. Credit: Courtesy National Woman's Party\n\nOrganized thematically and chronologically, the exhibition seeks to contextualize the full history of women's suffrage from the movement's early roots in the early 1830s to the ratification of the 19th Amendment in 1920.\n\n\"Suffrage didn't appear out of thin air. It came out of the abolitionist movement,\" Lemay said of the often-obscured links between the suffrage movement and broader American history. \"For whatever reason it hasn't made its way to the forefront of the American mindset when we think about American history.\n\nA portrait of Sojourner Truth c. 1870. Born into slavery around 1797, she was both an abolishionist and campaigner for women's rights. Credit: Courtesy National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution\n\nBy placing women's suffrage within the broader context of women's lives, Lemay hopes to highlight the role women have played in the story of their country: \"This exhibition lets us rethink and reconsider who we put at the forefront of history.\"\n\nA complicated legacy\n\nWhile much of the exhibition celebrates the white women who became famous during the fight for suffrage, the exhibition also explores the racial tensions that complicates their legacy and highlights the work of women of color. Despite being at the forefront of the movement, women of color -- particularly black women -- are often excluded from conversations about the movement, and their struggle for voting rights after the passage of the 19th Amendment is too often left out completely. For example, Native American men and women did not gain the right to vote until 1924, when they were granted citizenship, and due to Jim Crow-era laws like poll taxes and literacy tests, black people did not fully gain the vote until 1965.\n\nLemay wanted to avoid those blind spots. \"Black women were organizing just as much as white women,\" she says, pointing out that their exclusion from national organizations and movements prompted black women to start their own organizations.\n\nA 1898 portrait of Yankton Dakota Sioux writer and activist Zitkala-sa, who campaigned for the citizenship rights of Native Americans. Credit: Courtesy National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian Institution\n\nHowever, that obscured history posed frustrating curatorial challenges. Because of their marginalized position, women of color were less likely than their white peers to be the subject of oil paintings and large photographs -- the sorts of objects viewers traditionally see as markers of importance and influence. With this in mind, Lemay was careful to include similarly sized photographs of figures within the movement, rather than risk throwing some in a more celebratory light than others.\n\nFinding photos of women of color taking part in protests was also a challenge. For example, a grainy scanned newspaper image was the only representation she was able to find of African-American journalist and civil rights leader Ida B. Wells at the historic 1913 Woman Suffrage Procession -- the first parade of its kind in Washington -- where she refused to march at the back with the other black participants, as she was told to by organizer Alice Paul. (Paul had wanted the parade to be segregated.)\n\nA 1884 portrait of Mary E. Church Terrell, one of the first African-American women to earn a college degree.

Lemay characterizes these fights as a \"lonely road\" too often overlooked in favor of celebrating the success of the early suffrage movement.\n\nA c. 1870 portrait of Victoria Claflin Woodhull, who ran for President of the United States in 1872. Credit: Courtesy Fine Arts Library, Harvard University\n\nBy framing the movement and its successes within the larger conversation around citizenship, the rights it brings and the ways in which those rights are denied to others, \"Votes for Women\" moves past simplistic narratives and reminds visitors that fights for citizenship and human rights are always intertwined and never over. This message is made even more resonant as activists fight the continuing fallout of the Supreme Court's overturning parts of the Voting Rights Act in 2013, including state voter ID laws that disproportionately impact communities of color and home address restrictions on voter registrations that impact Native Americans.\n\nAs a result, the exhibition is more layered, nuanced, and challenging than many conceptions of suffrage have allowed.\n\n\"It's not so much a celebration as a mark along the way,\" Sajet says. \"There were still more journeys to go, and to this day.\"\n\nTop image: A photo of African-American civil rights leader and investigative journalist Ida B.

    "text": "Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other House members unveiled a bipartisan reintroduction of the Violence Against Women Act on Thursday, urging Congress to support key provisions of the landmark legislation that provides protection for domestic violence survivors.\n\nVAWA expired in February after its funding was excluded from President Donald Trump's spending bill to avoid a second government shutdown. But the legislation's omission in that spending package provided Democratic lawmakers with the opportunity to push new reforms that wouldn't pass under last year's Republican-controlled Congress.\n\n\"There should be nothing partisan, or political about ending the scourge of domestic violence or sexual assault which 1 in 3 women face today,\" Pelosi said at the news conference. \"We hope to receive more bipartisan support as the bill moves forward.\"\n\nThe reauthorization would strengthen legal protection for LGBTQ, Native American and immigrant women, and make it harder for those convicted of crimes related to domestic violence to acquire firearms, Pelosi said.\n\n\"Every woman everywhere has a right to live free from abuse. We urge all members to join us in strong bipartisan support for this bill.\"\n\nVAWA was first signed in 1994 and has since been reauthorized three times, in 2000, 2005 and 2013. Although the legislation has bipartisan support, Democrats and Republicans have historically disagreed over specific provisions. In 2012, conservative Republicans rejected the act's extension of protections to same-sex couples and provisions allowing undocumented immigrants experiencing abuse to claim temporary visas. The reauthorization in 2013 had the protections for same-sex couples but not the provisions for undocumented immigrants.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Jerrold Nadler of New York said at the news conference that reauthorization would also expand grant money and filter more resources toward training and prevention efforts.\n\nThe 2019 reauthorization is co-sponsored by Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania and Democratic Rep. Karen Bass of California. The House Judiciary is hearing testimony about reauthorization and will debate the bill in upcoming weeks.\n\nLike this story?

    "description": "The Federal Aviation Administration and an inspector general will signal changes to aviation safety oversight in the wake of two fatal Boeing 737 MAX 8 crashes, according to prepared testimony obtained by CNN for a highly anticipated congressional hearing.",
    "text": "(CNN) The Federal Aviation Administration and an inspector general will signal changes to aviation safety oversight in the wake of two fatal Boeing 737 MAX 8 crashes, according to prepared testimony obtained by CNN for a highly anticipated congressional hearing.\n\nDan Elwell, the acting FAA administrator, will tell members of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation's Subcommittee on Aviation and Space Wednesday afternoon that the agency's \"oversight approach needs to evolve,\" although he will say the processes used to certify the 737 MAX were \"extensive, well-established, and have consistently produced safe aircraft designs for decades.\"\n\nHe will defend the FAA's initial decision not to ground the 737 MAX fleet, even as other regulators worldwide did so, saying the agency was not seeing \"systemic performance issues\" with the plane but that it acted three days later when it received \"new information\" from investigators.\n\nElwell will testify alongside Transportation Department Inspector General Calvin Scovel, an agency watchdog, and National Transportation Safety Board Chairman Robert Sumwalt, whose independent federal board investigates incidents and makes recommendations to the FAA and others with regulatory authority. The FAA is part of the Transportation Department.\n\nThe inspector general said changes are coming this summer to a program that allows aircraft manufacturers to sign off on their own work in the FAA's name.\n\n\"By July 2019, FAA plans to introduce a new process that represents a significant change in its oversight approach,\" Scovel's testimony reads. \"For example, FAA's new process will include identifying system elements and developing new evaluation criteria.\"\n\nA spokesman for the FAA declined to comment on or provide details about the changes.\n\nElwell's testimony describes the program -- Organization Designation Authorization -- as \"critical to the success and effectiveness of the certification process\" and mandated by Congress to help manage the FAA's hefty and complex workload.\n\nScovel's testimony summarizes inspector general concerns with the program dating to 2011.\n\n\"Our work over the years on the ODA program has identified management weaknesses with a number of FAA's oversight processes,\" Scovel's testimony reads. \"To its credit, the Agency has taken action to improve its oversight in response to our recommendations.\"\n\nScovel confirms the inspector general's office is probing the 737 MAX certification in response to multiple requests, and Sumwalt's testimony says the NTSB is reviewing \"the US design certification process to ensure any deficiencies are captured and addressed.\"\n\nBoeing officials will be \"carefully monitoring\" the hearing from DC-area offices in Arlington, Virginia.\n\n\"Boeing continues to support the ongoing accident investigations, and is working with the authorities to evaluate new information as it becomes available,\" the company said in a statement. \"Safety is our top priority when we design, build, deliver and maintain Boeing aircraft. Boeing has worked with the FAA, DOT, NTSB, pilots and airline customers as well as other aviation community partners for decades to make flying the world's safest mode of transportation.\"\n\nThe witnesses reveal little about the ongoing investigations of the October Lion Air crash and the Ethiopian Airlines crash earlier this month, which are being conducted by other countries' safety boards with assistance from the NTSB and Boeing. The FAA called the two incidents similar when it grounded the 737 MAX fleet, and investigators are probing a stabilization system that appears to have driven the nose of the Lion Air plane down while the pilots tried repeatedly to pull the plane up.\n\nElwell's testimony reveals that Boeing submitted a proposal to change the system's software to the FAA on January 21, long before the Ethiopian crash and while the FAA and other government agencies were largely closed because of a funding impasse between Congress and the White House. Elwell told reporters earlier this month that the software change had not been delayed by the shutdown.\n\nHe also said the 737 MAX certification involved 297 flight tests, including flights that assessed the stabilization system, the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System.\n\nThe shutdown did impact the NTSB's work investigating the Lion Air crash, Sumwalt reveals. He notes that investigators were furloughed due to the government shutdown but \"NTSB recalled four investigators from furlough ... to assist with proper transcription\" of the cockpit voice recorder, which was recovered in mid-January.",

    "text": "lenetstan/Shutterstock\n\nThe initial-public-offering market suffered through a slow start to the year because of the partial government shutdown and the brutal fourth quarter for financial markets, but public debuts are ratcheting back up.\n\nWhile a host of high-profile unicorns and decacorns like Lyft, Uber, Airbnb, and Slack are set to debut on the public market this year, so far healthcare has dominated the US IPO slate.\n\nIt's still early to compare this year's performance to prior years', but so far healthcare is the most active sector to debut on US exchanges in 2019, according to Renaissance Capital.\n\nThe group's showing in the first quarter suggests a strong year ahead for biotech and healthcare, some analysts say.\n\nInvestors in private and public companies know there's a massive slate of highly anticipated initial public offerings coming this year.\n\nHigh-profile technology and transportation unicorns and decacorns like Lyft, Uber, Slack, and Pinterest are all set to debut on the public markets in the coming months after a sleepy first quarter. A host of others, like Airbnb and Peleton, have also reportedly explored going public.\n\nAnd even after a slow start to IPOs this year \u2014 in part because of the partial government shutdown and one of the worst fourth quarters on record \u2014 an overshadowed corner of the market is enjoying a strong run: healthcare.\n\nThe sector is the most active to debut in the US public market so far in 2019, followed by financials, according to data from Renaissance Capital. Healthcare is also the most active over the past year.\n\nInvestors' excitement around newly public biotechnology companies suggests a strong year ahead after healthcare outperformed the broader US IPO market in 2018, the Oppenheimer analysts Jay Olson and Silvan T\u00fcrkcan said.\n\nWhile it's still too early to compare, initial IPO returns in the biotech space are positive this year. They've averaged 2% in about one month compared with 2018 IPOs returning 4% for the whole year, according to their analysis.\n\nSo far this year, 11 biotech IPOs have raised a combined $1.2 billion. Notably, those IPOs in 2019 have been predominantly in the cancer-immunotherapy space, according to Oppenheimer's analysis. The largest so far is Gossamer Bio, which raised $317 million.\n\n\"In discussions with investors, we have received favorable feedback and continued interest in 2019 Biotech IPOs,\" they wrote.\n\nRead more: The market for biotech IPOs is red hot \u2014 here are the top 10 of 2018\n\nThe relatively high number of healthcare companies entering the market isn't just confined to the US. Globally, healthcare and technology were the most active sectors in the first quarter, according to Ernst & Young data.\n\nBetween January and March, there were 45 IPOs in the technology space \u2014 the most of any sector \u2014 followed by the 32 in the healthcare sector.\n\nSo where is all this excitement coming from, and is it a sign of a group that's overheating?\n\nPut simply, and while trying not to sound \"clich\u00e9,\" the Stifel biotechnology analyst Paul Matteis says there's a widespread perception that science around drug development is improving and investors want to get in on advances in different areas like gene therapy, neuroscience, and oncology.\n\n\"It's still early days for leveraging some of the newer tools, like gene therapy and RNAi, that have emerged as vehicles to leverage science that's improving across an array of disease areas,\" Matteis told Markets Insider on Thursday, adding that companies felt as if they had better access to capital.\n\n\"There's been this expansion of tools to tackle and target specific genes,\" he said.\n\nStill, Matteis doesn't think investor sentiment is near the uber-bullish heights of 2015. Between 2014 and 2015, investors saw a relatively high 50 to 60 biotech IPOs a year, according to Oppenheimer's analysis.\n\nThe Nasdaq Biotechnology Index is up just over 13% this year, barely outperforming the S&P 500's 12.8% gain. The Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund has gained 6% this year.\n\nNow read more markets coverage from Markets Insider and Business Insider:",

    "title": "After setbacks, Vector planning two rocket launches in 2019",
    "description": "\"No rocket\u2019s ever been late, we\u2019ll probably be the first one.\"",
    "text": "Vector\n\nVector\n\nVector\n\nVector\n\nVector\n\nLike a lot of companies that aspire to launch rockets, Vector has had its ups and downs along the way to the launch pad. But in an interview with Ars, Vector's co-founder and chief executive, Jim Cantrell, said the micro-launch company is continuing to make progress toward space and intends to launch two rockets this year.\n\n\"Basically we\u2019ve had to revise our development plan,\" said Cantrell, who had previously hoped to see Vector make its first space launch in 2018. \"No rocket\u2019s ever been late; we\u2019ll probably be the first one,\" he added, with a laugh.\n\nVector's new plan targets the launch of a suborbital rocket, Vector-R B1001, for June. (There is no formal launch date yet set, Cantrell said, because \"stuff happens.\") This mission will have a customer, but Cantrell isn't ready to say who yet. Then, before the end of the year, the company intends to fly its first orbital rocket, Vector-R B1003, from the Pacific Spaceport Complex in Alaska.\n\nUnder the new plan, Vector now plans to skip an intermediate step in the development of its Vector-R rocket, which had been dubbed B1002. While this core would have been capable of reaching orbit, it would have only a very small payload capacity, unable to carry much more than some instrumentation. \"For us, this turned out to be a dead-end configuration,\" Cantrell said. Therefore, the company now plans to move directly from the suborbital test launch into a vehicle with larger tanks and more capable LP-1 engines.\n\nIn recent months, Cantrell cited a number of challenges Vector has had to overcome. The partial government shutdown affected its operations, as have range closures at the Alaska spaceport for other tenants. Also, the rocket's autonomous flight-termination system, provided by an outside vendor, failed qualification tests.\n\nThen there has been the mass of the vehicle itself. The rocket's engines and their novel use of a liquid oxygen and liquid propylene fuel have worked as intended, but the fuel tanks were too heavy. So engineers have been working to lower their mass, and Cantrell said they're getting the vehicle's weight where it needs to be to deliver a 60kg payload to space.\n\nDuring the last 18 months, as it has been developing the Vector-R launch system, the company has also been scaling up to fly more frequently in the future. It has built engine and rocket test facilities near its Tucson, Ariz. headquarters, Cantrell said, as well as an \"interim\" factory capable of producing as many as 36 rockets a year. The company now has 170 workers, and Cantrell said Vector's demand for engineers has exceeded his original estimates.\n\nTo date, Vector has raised just over $98 million, and it will need another \"growth capital\" round as it seeks to bring the Vector-R vehicle to the launch pad, and scale the company from development into operations. \"This is a capital-intensive business,\" Cantrell said.\n\nThere is yet time to join in the small satellite launch competition, but it is finite. With its fourth launch last week, Rocket Lab is clearly well ahead of the other new space startups seeking to deliver small payloads into orbit. But with just a 60kg capacity, and a lower price point, Vector still has a chance to make its mark in the micro-launch category.\n\nAsked what advice Cantrell would offer himself, if he could go back in time to late 2015, when he, John Garvey, and others founded the company, Cantrell paused, and then offered this response: \"I'd say, be patient.\"\n\nListing image by Vector",

    "title": "John Kelly Tries To Distance Himself From Immigration Policies He Helped Implement",
    "description": "The retired four-star general and former White House chief of staff spoke Wednesday at Duke University.",
    "text": "Former White House chief of staff John Kelly distanced himself Wednesday from President Donald Trump\u2019s views on immigration, but the remarks contradict Kelly\u2019s record and past comments on the issue.\n\nKelly spoke at Duke University about his time initially working as secretary of the Department of Homeland Security and eventually as Trump\u2019s right-hand man. The retired four-star general left his chief of staff position in late December.\n\nDuring his talk Wednesday, Kelly said that a full \u201csea to shining sea\u201d border wall would be a \u201cwaste of money.\u201d Kelly made a similar comment in April 2017 as DHS secretary, saying he\u2019s \u201cnot going to build a wall where it doesn\u2019t make sense. But we\u2019ll do something across the southwest border.\u201d\n\nKelly\u2019s former boss, meanwhile, has long called for wall funding, a demand that even contributed to the January 2018 government shutdown \u2015 nearly a year before the record-breaking wall shutdown that was ongoing when Kelly left the White House.\n\nKelly also distanced himself Wednesday from Trump\u2019s perception of immigrants crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. The president frequently uses fearmongering language to paint migrant families and asylum-seekers as criminals.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re overwhelmingly not criminals,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cThey\u2019re people coming up here for economic purposes. I don\u2019t blame them for that.\u201d\n\nThe remark was a bit of a pivot from Kelly\u2019s past comments on immigrants. In February 2018, he said Trump\u2019s proposed path to citizenship for people eligible for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, including those who didn\u2019t sign up, was generous because it would help undocumented immigrants who are \u201ctoo lazy\u201d to seek protections. He later doubled down on his comments, saying people \u201cjust should have probably gotten off the couch and signed up.\u201d\n\nNEW: White House Chief of Staff John Kelly defends comment on people not signing up for DACA: \"I gotta say that some of them just should have probably gotten off the couch and signed up.\" https://t.co/6vGynH9tYS pic.twitter.com/QWbTWXL0iE \u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) February 7, 2018\n\nIn May 2018, Kelly also told NPR that immigrants who come to the U.S. illegally are \u201cnot people that would easily assimilate into the United States, into our modern society.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t integrate well,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cThey don\u2019t have skills.\u201d\n\nKelly on Wednesday defended himself in regard to Trump\u2019s zero-tolerance policy on border crossings, which resulted in family separations and missing migrant children, saying the policy \u201ccame as a surprise\u201d to him and current DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. He made similar comments in December, putting the blame on former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who announced the policy in which those found to be illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border would be criminally prosecuted.\n\nSessions \u201cwas the one that instituted the zero-tolerance process on the border that resulted in both people being detained and the family separation,\u201d Kelly told The Los Angeles Times. \u201cHe surprised us.\u201d\n\nDHS has tried to portray the family separations as their hands being forced by Sessions\u2019 decision to prosecute everyone referred.\n\nNielsen still gave the order in May to affirmatively choose to refer parents for prosecution, discretion that was walked back in June. https://t.co/avFvAs4W1I \u2014 Tal Kopan (@TalKopan) March 7, 2019\n\nBut a March 2017 interview with CNN revealed that Kelly himself suggested separating families to deter unauthorized immigration. When asked if the Trump administration was considering separating migrant children from their parents, he said, \u201cYes, I am considering in order to deter more movement along this terribly dangerous network. I am considering exactly that.\u201d\n\nDHS Secretary says he's considering separating immigant children from their parents to deter illegal immigration https://t.co/VI7iRONztC \u2014 The Situation Room (@CNNSitRoom) March 6, 2017\n\nIn May 2018, Kelly told NPR that migrant children separated from their parents \u201cwill be taken care of \u2015 put into foster care or whatever.\u201d",

    "description": "Markets sold off sharply on Friday following poor German data.",
    "text": "The risk of a major slowdown to the German and Chinese economies are overblown and global risk assets still look attractive, according to economists at Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe investment bank claimed in a note to clients Sunday that there was a \"bright picture\" for perceived riskier investments if near term events such as Brexit and the U.S.-China trade war can be successfully negotiated.\n\nMarkets sold off sharply Friday after poor German data set in motion a consensus that a global slowdown was imminent. The spread between the three-month U.S. Treasury bill and the 10-year note turned negative on Friday \u2014 the first time this has happened in more than a decade. Investors consider this to be a signal that a recession may be coming.\n\nThat bearish bond move sent equities tumbling but the weekend message from Goldman is to keep calm.\n\n\"We think this is a major overreaction,\" said Goldman economists Jan Hatzius and Sven Jari Stehn in the note.\n\n\"For one thing the German manufacturing index was an outlier among European PMIs (Purchasing Managers' Index), in particular the service sector readings looked fine in Germany and elsewhere in the euro area.\"\n\nThe economists added that while pressure on German manufacturing was valid, easy fiscal conditions and a strong labor market pointed to a coming upturn in fortunes.\n\nOn China, Goldman said its Current Activity Indicator (CAI) was showing a 2019 pick-up for the world's second-largest economy and that decent PMI figures for March, due next weekend, would increase confidence that \"the worst in global growth is behind us.\"\n\nHatzius and Stehn were particularly bullish on the United States' prospects. While Goldman forecasts U.S. real GDP (when adjusted for inflation) for the first quarter to be just 0.7 percent, it then predicts a big jump back to 3 percent for the second quarter.\n\nThe analysts put the sudden change down to the end of the government shutdown, seasonal factors as well as an improvement in the underlying picture. The note was released too early to consider any impact of the Mueller report's findings.\n\nThe Goldman duo admitted that their relaxed view is based on a relatively speedy resolution to Brexit and the ongoing trade negotiations between China and the United States. Goldman have made the case that Brexit could well end up with Britain remaining in a customs union and that President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping will sign a deal \"within the next few months.\"\n\nOn strategy, Goldman said it had eased back from positive views on \"economically sensitive assets\" across stocks, emerging market bonds and currencies, and commodities.\n\nHowever, the bank said this was in part due to a recent punchy run in those areas and the picture for risk assets remained \"quite bright in an environment of gradually stronger global growth.\"",

    "text": "\n\nVisitors to the Pittsburgh veterans job fair meet with recruiters at Heinz Field in Pittsburgh on March 7. (Keith Srakocic/AP)\n\nThe United States added just 20,000 jobs in February, way below expectations of a gain of 180,000, and a sign that the job market may be cooling.\n\nThe unemployment rate fell slightly, to 3.8 percent, the Labor Department reported Friday.\n\nEconomists did not immediately panic, as hiring has been strong in recent months and they do not consider one disappointing number a signal of an imminent recession. But the lackluster February figure comes as growth is slowing. Economic growth abroad has weakened, and the recent partial government shutdown and ongoing trade tensions appear to be weighing on consumer spending.\n\nHiring was slow in every industry except health care and white-collar businesses. Construction lost 31,000 jobs, and leisure and hospitality, which is normally a driver of growth, was unchanged. Some experts say this could be the result of brutal weather in February, including a deep freeze in much of the Midwest.\n\n[How healthy is Trump's economy?]\n\nWages grew 3.4 percent in the past year, the best annual gain since April 2009, when the United States was in the Great Recession. Wages are now growing well above the cost of living. Inflation has been just 1.6 percent in the past year, according to the Commerce Department.\n\n\u201cIf the party was over, we wouldn\u2019t see those wages coming in so strong,\u201d said Beth Ann Bovino, chief U.S. economist at S&P. \u201cA lot of the weakness in hiring looks like it was due to seasonal factors like very cold weather.\u201d\n\nThe unemployment rate for Americans who didn\u2019t graduate from high school fell to 5.3 percent in February, the lowest level since the Labor Department began tracking that statistic in the early 1990s. Bovino said it\u2019s another sign that the job market is still strong enough that people on the sidelines are searching for jobs and finding work again after years of struggle.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen a spike in job postings that say \u2018no experience necessary\u2019 or \u2018no prior experience required,\u2019\u201d said Julia Pollak, an economist at ZipRecruiter. \u201cEmployers really do seem hungry for workers and prepared to do more than they did in the past to develop talent when they can\u2019t find talent.\"\n\n[From $22 an hour to $11: GM job cuts in Ohio show a hot economy is still leaving parts of America behind]\n\nBut some are concerned that the U.S. economy may be catching a cold as Europe, China and much of the developing world struggles.\n\nU.S. stocks fell when trading opened, continuing a week-long slide. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 200 points as investors worry about the weakening global economy and a growing likelihood that corporate profits will decline.\n\n\u201cThe reality is the economy is slowing. The question now is whether it\u2019s slowing for reasons associated with the trade war or because the rest of the world is slowing,\u201d said Torsten Slok, chief international economist at Deutsche Bank. He called the February jobs number \u201cslightly worrisome.\u201d\n\nEconomists have been predicting hiring would slow down for a while now. Job openings exceed the number of unemployed, meaning there aren\u2019t many Americans left to hire and many companies complain that they can\u2019t find the talent they want.\n\n[Global economic slowdown looms, exposing outgunned central banks]\n\nThe current labor market is widely viewed as the best since the start of the 2000s, most economists and business leaders say. There is so much demand for highly skilled workers with specialized data and computer skills that employers are sometimes hiring and poaching workers when they don\u2019t have an actual job opening for them.\n\n\u201cWe know there will be demand for them soon,\u201d said Martin Fleming, chief economist at IBM, who said the company has been hiring people with MBAs and those coming out of PhD programs even when there isn\u2019t necessarily a job posting for them because it\u2019s a \u201chighly competitive landscape\u201d between companies such as IBM, Facebook, Amazon and Google for top young talent.\n\nThe gains also are starting to show up in some lower-skilled jobs. Wages have generally been rising fastest for the lowest earning workers, a sign that it\u2019s getting harder to find people for all kinds of jobs even in restaurants and retail and that minimum wage increases in 19 states in January are having an effect.\n\nMany economists were quick to point out that the data can jump around a lot month to month, and in January a particularly high number of jobs were added, 311,000, so the anticipation was for a weaker February. Larry Kudlow, the head of President Trump\u2019s National Economic Council, brushed it off as a \u201cfluky number\u201d in an appearance on CNBC.\n\nThe last month when hiring was this slow was September 2017, when only 18,000 jobs were added. The economy added 260,000 jobs the following month.\n\nThe unemployment rate is calculated through a different survey than the jobs number, and the two sometimes diverge, which may partly explain how the official unemployment rate fell despite the slow job growth.\n\nRelated:\n\nFrom $22 an hour to $11: GM job cuts in Ohio show a hot economy is still leaving parts of America behind\n\nHas growth peaked? Economists see a slowdown. Trump doesn\u2019t.\n\nAs trade deficit explodes, Trump finds he can\u2019t escape the laws of economics",

    "title": "Everything to Know About the Spa Founder Selling Access to Trump",
    "description": "The founder of a Florida spa chain linked to prostitution went from political nobody to Mar-a-Lago elite, and the story keeps getting shadier.",
    "text": "Cindy Yang and President Trump in a photo signed by Trump, which Yang posted on Facebook. Photo: Facebook/Screencap via The Miami Herald\n\nThe woman who founded the Florida spa where police allege Patriots owner Robert Kraft solicited prostitution appears to have also sold access to the president, according to investigations by the Miami Herald and Mother Jones. The reports not only raise another red flag about how political influence has been monetized during the Trump presidency, but provide new evidence of how Trump-branded properties have become magnets for corruption and grift \u2014 and may soon lead to new investigations into what may have been illegal campaign donations to Trump and the RNC.\n\nWho Is Cindy Yang?\n\nAt the center of this developing story is Cindy (Li) Yang, a 45-year-old entrepreneur and naturalized U.S. citizen from China who started fundraising for Trump in 2017. Yang and her family members founded a chain of Asian day spas in Florida, mostly under the Tokyo Day Spa brand. One of the spas Yang founded but later sold was the Orchids of Asia spa in Jupiter, Florida, where police say they filmed billionaire Robert Kraft paying for oral sex in late January as part of a multi-agency law-enforcement operation targeting human trafficking at spas in the state. Ten Asian day spas were ultimately raided and shut down as a result of that investigation, but Orchids of Asia was the only one associated with Yang.\n\nAccording to the Miami Herald, there is no indication that Yang was implicated in the sting. However, the Herald reports that many of the day spas she and her family have owned and operated, including the location which later became Orchids of Asia, at the time Yang still ran it, have earned reputations as so-called rub-and-tug parlors, where sexual services are sold to clients in addition to massage.\n\nYang and her family members have opened at least six day spas as well as a massage school and several nail salons \u2014 all in Palm Beach and Broward counties. \u201cThe family\u2019s Tokyo Day Spa branches have attracted the attention of at least two local police agencies over allegations of prostitution, and are discussed online as places where men can pay for sexual extras,\u201d the Herald reported on Friday. The publication dug through Yelp and websites aimed at would-be patrons of rub-and-tug businesses, and noted allegations from former employees and customers:\n\nOnline ads on obscure websites also raise flags about Yang\u2019s businesses. In an ad written in Chinese recruiting masseuses, Yang stated that anyone over the age of 45 need not apply. Phone numbers associated with members of the Yang family are connected to various apparently old online advertisements for more explicit sex services.\n\nThe Herald reported on Friday that Yang denied that she or her family members had done anything illegal, but did not respond when asked whether they were aware of allegations that sexual services were being sold at their businesses. She also said she wanted to avoid negative press ahead of her upcoming move \u2014 to Washington.\n\nFrom massage to MAGA\n\nIf there is any evidence that Cindy Yang had an interest in politics before the 2016 presidential race, the Miami Herald couldn\u2019t find it. She hadn\u2019t voted in ten years, but then seemed to undergo some kind of political awakening. She made some small donations to Jeb Bush\u2019s presidential campaign in 2015 and talked about starting a \u201cnew life\u201d in a Facebook post from a GOP women\u2019s event in 2016. But then, she started posting more and more about politics on social media as the general election played out. She also removed her name from the business records of the spas she founded, and had founded what the Herald characterized as a disorganized charity called the Overseas International Female Organization.\n\nWithin a year of Trump\u2019s election, Yang was deep in the MAGA muck. She had been to Trump\u2019s inauguration, a fancy New York fundraiser, an elite lunch at Mar-a-Lago, and she had started fundraising for the president. She had also started amassing a large collection of photos of herself with Trump, Trump family members, Trump administration officials, Republican lawmakers, and conservative personalities.\n\nAnd still more. Here are photos of Cindy (Li) Yang with Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao and another of Chao with Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross, both members of President Trump's cabinet. https://t.co/xrqjKVlL2n pic.twitter.com/hd2EMeJwck \u2014 Christal Hayes (@Journo_Christal) March 9, 2019\n\nSince 2017, Yang and family members have donated almost $60,000 to the Trump campaign and the Trump Victory super-PAC, and she has frequented Mar-a-Lago, where she recently took a selfie with the president during the club\u2019s Super Bowl party. She\u2019s also been to the White House, where she attended a meeting of Trump\u2019s Asian American and Pacific Islander Initiative in February 2018. She has apparently attended at least two other events hosted by the group in Washington, as well.\n\nYang\u2019s Trumpmania may not have been all about MAGA, however, as she didn\u2019t just obtain access, but has tried to profit from it.\n\nSelling the presidential selfie in China\n\nA little more than a year after Trump\u2019s election, Yang and her husband started a consulting firm, GY US Investments, targeting Chinese businesses looking to expand their operations in the U.S. The company\u2019s website marketed Yang\u2019s connections to Trump, his administration, and his conservative allies. To prove that point, the site featured numerous photos of Yang posing with Trump, Trump family members, White House officials and various other Republicans and conservative personalities.\n\nSome more pics from Cindy (Li) Yang's consulting business site: Photo with President Trump, Trump's campaign manager Brad Parscale, Rep. Brian Mast and Adam Putnam, who was in the heat of campaigning for Florida governor at the time. https://t.co/xrqjKVlL2n pic.twitter.com/QExh7rcGFJ \u2014 Christal Hayes (@Journo_Christal) March 9, 2019\n\nAccording to Mother Jones, \u201cthe overall message conveyed by the GY US Investments website seems clear: hire Yang\u2019s company and she can get you close to Trump and his government \u2014 at Mar-a-Lago and in Washington.\u201d The GY site, which went offline after the Herald story broke but can still be seen in archived form, claimed that the firm had arranged attendance and photo opportunities for clients at the White House\u2019s \u201cAsian New Year\u201d celebration in 2018, had gotten \u201ca number of guests\u201d into the annual New Year\u2019s Eve bash at Mar-a-Lago this year, and teased more opportunities to come:\n\nThe GY US Investments website lists upcoming events at Mar-a-Lago at which Yang\u2019s clients presumably can mingle with Trump or members of his family. This includes something called the International Leaders Elite Forum, where Trump\u2019s sister, Elizabeth Trump Grau, will supposedly be the featured speaker. Attendees, the site says, will include \u201cChinese elites from various countries, including the US states, as well as elite leaders from Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, Australia, Europe and other countries and regions.\u201d Another event for which Yang\u2019s firm says it can provide access is Trump\u2019s annual New Year\u2019s celebration at Mar-a-Lago. Elsewhere on the website, the firm boasts that \u201cGY Company arranged a number of guests to attend the 2019 New Year\u2019s Eve dinner. All the guests took photos with\u201d members of Trump\u2019s family. This page displays photos of Chinese executives and a Chinese movie star with Donald Trump Jr., suggesting that these pics were arranged by the company, and also includes a photo of Yang with Elizabeth Trump Grau.\n\nCoupled next to a photo of Mar-a-Lago, here's how Cindy Yang's business consulting website describes some of its services and how it can help you connect with President Trump and his cabinet:\n\n\n\nStory - https://t.co/xrqjKVlL2n pic.twitter.com/Jrl43Gwa6j \u2014 Christal Hayes (@Journo_Christal) March 9, 2019\n\nThe first Trump event Yang may have sold access to was in late 2017. On Saturday, the Miami Herald reported that Yang had attended a fundraiser on December 7 at Cipriani New York, and was accompanied by a group of Chinese business executives. She said the foreigners were her \u201cguests,\u201d according to one of the attendees:\n\nIn the 11 days before the event, Yang gave $5,400 to Trump\u2019s campaign and $23,500 to the Trump Victory political action committee, according to a Miami Herald analysis of federal political contributions. [Yang] also claimed to have arranged the presence of a large group of business people from mainland China.\n\nNearly 100 of the 400 or so guests at the New York fundraiser were Chinese, according to Chinese-language media reports at the time. Even Trump noted the disproportion at the event, according to the Herald:\n\nThe source who attended the party said the president joked that the Chinese guests got all the good seats and would be omnipresent at future events if his American friends in real estate didn\u2019t start donating more. The source said admission started at $2,700, and photos with the president were offered for $10,000.\n\nTen days after the event, Yang and her husband registered GY US Investments as a company in Florida and began marketing her access.\n\nYang\u2019s company is promoting an upcoming event at Mar-a-Lago featuring Trump\u2019s sister, Elizabeth Trump Grau. The co. bills it as \u201ca once-in-a-lifetime publicity opportunity\u201d where \"Chinese elites\" will have the chance to mingle with Trump Grau and members of Congress pic.twitter.com/5iCxZXqkVA \u2014 Daniel Schulman (@DanielSchulman) March 9, 2019\n\nDid Yang break the law?\n\nIt\u2019s not yet clear. Since U.S. election law only allows American citizens and permanent residents to contribute money to a U.S. politician, foreigners can only attend political fundraisers if they do not pay their way in. If Yang paid for a foreign citizen\u2019s ticket, but was reimbursed by them \u2014 thus acting as a conduit for foreign donations \u2014 that would be illegal.\n\nMimi Rocah, a former federal prosecutor with the Southern District of New York, commented on Saturday that a law-enforcement investigation may now be an inevitability. She explained that there seemed to be \u201ca lot of potential criminal conduct\u201d in the reports, and the next step, she said, was to find out how and why Yang had access, predicting that, \u201cI see subpoenas in her future.\u201d\n\nReached for comment about her businesses and Trump connections by the Miami Herald, Cindy Yang said she did not know the president personally or work for him, but has volunteered with the Trump campaign:\n\n\u201cI just come to some events. There\u2019s nothing special,\u201d Yang said. Although she has claimed online to be a member of Trump clubs, she told the Herald she does not in fact belong to any.\n\nIs this a national security risk?\n\nSam Vinograd, who served on President Obama\u2019s National Security Council, speculated on Saturday that it was very likely China, thanks to its counterintelligence strength, knew about Yang\u2019s access, and may have even directed it. Another national security expert, Lawfare\u2019s Susan Hennessey made a similar point.\n\nOn Sunday, Mother Jones reported that Yang was an officer in two groups with links to China\u2019s government, though stressed there was no evidence to suggest she was involved in espionage. According to the report, an online profile of Yang said she held senior roles in Florida local branches of the (American) Chinese Association of Science and Technology and the Council for the Promotion of the Peaceful Reunification of China (CPPRC). Both organizations have numerous U.S. chapters, and don\u2019t at all prove that Yang was some kind of government agent, but they are still organizations which are linked to China\u2019s Communist Party, and at least one, the CPPRC, is meant to help promote Chinese influence. Mother Jones also notes that Yang was once invited to attend a ceremony welcoming three warships as they docked in Florida \u2014 an event which was also attended by China\u2019s ambassador to the U.S. and consul general.\n\nWhat about blackmail?\n\nAnother potential security risk revolves around sex work that may have been performed at Yang\u2019s day spas, as well as their proximity to Trump\u2019s southern White House \u2014 Mar-a-Lago. What if, as the Daily Beast\u2019s David Rothkopf loudly worried on Saturday, Trump or members of his inner circle have been customers at any of the spas operated by Yang and her family. Billionaire Trump friend Robert Kraft allegedly was. And billionaire Trump backer John Childs allegedly paid for sexual services at a different Asian day spa caught up in the same sting.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be a spy novelist to imagine the blackmail opportunities such a situation could create. There are no indications that any other Trumpworld figures were spa clients, but no one should be surprised if Trump\u2019s tabloid presidency gets somehow crazier, or sleazier.\n\nIs anyone else trying to sell White House access in China?\n\nYang, of course, is only the latest specific example of the gold rush of influence seekers and peddlers who have tried to work their way into Trump\u2019s orbit since he was elected president. In the half-exploded ethical minefield of the Trump administration, concerns over executives and foreigners using Trump family businesses to gain access and influence within the White House have been repeatedly justified. Just this past week, ProPublica reported that a Mar-a-Lago member was able to get Trump to forward his personal policy idea to the head of the Veterans Administration \u2014 hardly the first or last time that will happen before Trump leaves office.\n\nJust two weeks ago, Bolsonaro's son, a Congressman in Brazil, hung out at Mar-a-Lago where he celebrated @realDonaldTrump and said, \"Build that wall! Brazilians are supporting you!\u201d\n\n\n\nVia @1100Penn: https://t.co/VNoooHQs1I https://t.co/rGvdDzsg8D \u2014 Zach Everson (@Z_Everson) March 9, 2019\n\nWhen it comes to obtaining access to Trump events, Yang\u2019s company has been just one of at least several options for interested parties in China. Last May, the Washington Post highlighted the rising number of well-off Chinese citizens who were attending Trump fundraisers. They reported that official-looking offer letters had made the rounds among wealthy businesspeople in China offering chances to meet Trump at a campaign fundraising event in Dallas for as much as $100,000. The Post even tracked down the source of that offer, and heard about tactics which seem somewhat similar to Yang\u2019s:\n\nIn an interview with The Washington Post, a Beijing man who claims to be an organizer of the excursion to Dallas said he coordinated a previous U.S. trip, bringing members of the Chinese business elite to snap selfies and pose for photos at a swanky Manhattan fund-raiser headlined by Trump in December. As part of his promotional materials for the Dallas trip, the man circulated pictures of wealthy Chinese business leaders, including a businessman known as the country\u2019s first owner of a Ferrari, standing shoulder to shoulder with Trump in formal wear and giving a thumbs-up. \u2026\n\nSun\u2019s invite claims that he and his associates have \u201cprior experience participating in three Republican president dinners in 2017,\u201d including the New York visit. The Post could not independently verify his involvement in any trips. In the interview, he said his Beijing-based company aims to raise the profile of Chinese entrepreneurs. The $100,000 per-person price tag includes airport pickup, lodging, meals and translator, the invitation says.\n\nThe RNC, in their response to the Post\u2019s story, denied having any knowledge of the efforts to woo Chinese nationals and said they would not have endorsed them if they had. \u201cWe maintain strict compliance with the law and have a zero-tolerance policy toward anyone who attempts to take advantage of the system in order to attend our events,\u201d an RNC spokeswoman said.\n\nThere have also been suspicions about presidency leveraging in China from someone with the closest possible ties to Trump. Jared Kushner was reportedly aggressively pursued by China\u2019s government after Trump got elected, and his family business was caught, more than once, using his connection to Trump to attract investment in the country.\n\nForeign citizens can spend as much as they want at Trump properties. At a typically Trump-attended event like the New Year\u2019s gala at Mar-a-Lago, the money just goes to Trump\u2019s company, not his campaign or the GOP. Trump did not attend the New Year\u2019s event at Mar-a-Lago this year, having decided to remain at the White House during his partial shutdown of the federal government. If he\u2019d gone, he may have run into Huachu Tang, the owner of an electric car company in China, who later told Yahoo Finance that he\u2019d made the trip from China with his wife in the hope of meeting Trump and raising the profile of his soon-to-be-public company. It\u2019s not clear if Tang was a client of Yang\u2019s firm or not. He said he had arranged the trip through a PR agency. Stood up by the president, Tang scored photos with Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, and the president\u2019s sister, instead.\n\nThis is Huachu Tang, owner of a Chinese electric car co., who flew 17 hours to attend the New Year's celebration at Mar-a-Lago in hopes of promoting his company. pic.twitter.com/Ajz6zHfZsR \u2014 Daniel Schulman (@DanielSchulman) March 9, 2019\n\nTang\u2019s company, when asked by Yahoo, declined to reveal how much he had paid to attend the event. According to the Palm Beach Post, Mar-a-Lago raised its prices for the party this year, and a pair of nonmember guests could expect to pay the Trump Organization as much as $2,500 to attend. We don\u2019t know who else was there, either. The Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics watchdog group has sued to gain access to Mar-a-Lago\u2019s visitor logs, but so far to no avail.\n\nThis post has been updated throughout to reflect new information and context.",

    "description": "The White House says closing the border is still an option but suggests it has no timeline despite earlier assertions it could happen this week.",
    "text": "CLOSE President Donald Trump said Tuesday he's taking a wait-and-see approach on his threat to close the southern border as soon as this week. Speaking in the Oval Office, Trump seemed pleased about recent efforts by Mexican authorities. (April 2) AP, AP\n\nWASHINGTON \u2013 After days of relentlessly attacking Mexico over illegal border crossings, the White House toned down its rhetoric Tuesday and suggested the U.S.\u2019s southern neighbor is actually helping to stop people from crossing the border illegally.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who last week threatened to seal off the southern border if Mexico didn't work to halt the crossings, told reporters that closing the border is still an option. But he said he had seen signs that Mexico \u201chas started apprehending more people.\u201d\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Trump made similar remarks in a message posted on Twitter.\n\n\u201cAfter many years (decades), Mexico is apprehending large numbers of people at their Southern Border, mostly from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cThey have ALL been taking U.S. money for years, and doing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for us, just like the Democrats in Congress!\u201d\n\nAfter many years (decades), Mexico is apprehending large numbers of people at their Southern Border, mostly from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. They have ALL been taking U.S. money for years, and doing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING for us, just like the Democrats in Congress! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 2, 2019\n\nTrump's latest comments signaled a shift in tone from the weekend when, speaking to reporters in Florida, he said there is a \"very good likelihood\" that he would close the border this week if Mexico doesn\u2019t do more to stem the influx of migrant families arriving from Central America.\n\nTrump made a similar threat on Twitter on Friday, writing in a pair of posts: \u201cIf Mexico doesn\u2019t immediately stop ALL illegal immigration coming into the United States through our Southern Border, I will be CLOSING....the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week.\"\n\n....through their country and our Southern Border. Mexico has for many years made a fortune off of the U.S., far greater than Border Costs.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2019\n\n....the Border, or large sections of the Border, next week. This would be so easy for Mexico to do, but they just take our money and \u201ctalk.\u201d Besides, we lose so much money with them, especially when you add in drug trafficking etc.), that the Border closing would be a good thing! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 29, 2019\n\nThe threat prompted objections from border-state Republicans and business groups such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which argued the move would damage the nation's economy.\n\nAsked about the economic impact of closing the border, Trump said Tuesday that \"security is more important to me than trade.\u201d\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Trump \u201cis not working on a specific timeline\u201d for closing the border and suggested that Mexico has been \"stepping up and helping\" to prevent illegal crossings \"by stopping them in Mexico.\"\n\n\u201cThese are things that we\u2019ve seen them do over the last several weeks, and they\u2019re stepping up and taking a greater sense of responsibility in that process,\u201d Sanders said during an appearance on Fox News. \u201cThat\u2019s a great thing. We need them to continue to do that so we aren\u2019t forced to take drastic action like closing the ports of entry at our border because we simply have no choice.\u201d\n\nPresident Donald Trump (Photo: Susan Walsh, AP Images)\n\nMeanwhile, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said on Monday he would \"act with prudence\" regarding Trump's threats shut down the border.\n\nLopez Obrador declined to speculate on the possible border closure but stressed that he takes the threat seriously.\n\n\"We are not going to confront the government of the United States,\" he said during his daily public address. \"I asked (my advisers) if they wanted us to be prudent, and I believe that this is the best thing, to have a policy of friendship with the United States government, to be good neighbors and act with great prudence, not engaging in a confrontation, in a lawsuit.\"\n\nRight now: Cutting aid and closing ports: Here's what's happening at the southern border\n\nCLOSE If President Donald Trump shuts down the U.S.-Mexico border, American consumers would reportedly have to say goodbye to their precious avocados.

    "description": "The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ushered in all sorts of new rules that take effect this year. Fear not: A plethora of tax software vendors are here to help.",
    "text": "We're less than two weeks out from the big day. Taxes are due, as always, on April 15 -- which falls on a Monday this year. You should already have your W-2, your 1099-DIV, your 1099-INT and all of the other forms. So, if you don't want to spend the weekend before scrambling to finish, it's time to sit down and get to work.\n\nThis year is going to be more challenging than ever. The US passed a mammoth tax-reform bill in 2017, called the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (let's call it TCJA from here on out). And the changes mean all kinds of modifications of the rules as well as 400 or more new or revised forms to complete.\n\nFear not: There are a multitude of tax software vendors here to help. These services, either through downloadable software, a web form or, increasingly, a smartphone app, turn the matter of taxes into a less painful question-and-answer dialogue. And if you think there's no such thing as free tax software, think again. Many of these services offer free versions for the simplest forms (e.g. 1040EZ -- at least the federal term), and one of these recommended services, Credit Karma, offers completely free tax preparation. (It makes money by taking a revenue cut of other affiliate services that it offers.)\n\nPicking the right tax preparation software can be almost as complicated as estimating what you owe the government. There are a plethora of features, with nuances, and much of what they offer is either not spelled out by vendors or buried in fine print. The following guide will ease the process, with descriptions of the more prominent offerings, their features and prices, and a guide to how to use them. We'll start with the top services available, and then go into greater depth about the new laws, and how the services differ.\n\nCNET may earn commission from the products featured on this page.\n\nThe vendors\n\nTurbo Tax by Intuit: CD, online, mobile. Listed prices range from a free tier for basic returns to $40 for the downloadable Basic edition to $90 for Self-employed. All packages tack on extra charges of $50 to $70 to add the Live CPA feature, and $50 for Max. State filings are $20 each for the online versions, and free with the Deluxe, Premium or Home & Business download editions. It generally offers the most comprehensive set of tools. A nice feature is charitable donations tracking, whereby you can use the software year-round to keep track of donations and have the program compute your deductions at tax time.\n\nTaxAct Online: CD, online, mobile. Listed prices range from $10 for the Basic online version to $97 for the Self-employed download/CD package. State filings are $20 to $37 depending on the package. It promises $100,000 of coverage if you find a higher refund somewhere else, and $100,000 to cover audit costs if its software causes an audit. One useful extra is a log of all the times your online paperwork has been accessed, including the IP address of the computer that gained access, in case you want to make sure no one but you has been into your account.\n\nRight now, TaxAct is offering $20 off, too.\n\nCredit Karma Tax : Online or mobile. The only vendor that offers no paid versions -- even state filings are free and included is a free audit defense. The tax product is part of the larger Credit Karma collection of services, including credit cards, loans and auto loans, off of which the company makes a fee for referrals. It has the thinnest offering of guarantees: no penalties insurance. However, if you get a higher refund from another vendor, they will offer a $100 gift certificate.\n\nH&R Block: CD, online, mobile. There's a free tier for individuals with simple returns. Listed prices range from $19 for the Basic download to $80 for the online Self-employed package. State filings are $30 to $40 depending on the package. Smartphone app offered. Tax Pro Review promises extra hand-holding from the company's network of CPAs.\n\nTax Slayer: Online or mobile. Listed prices range from $24 for Classic to $47 for Self-employed. State filings are $29 extra each. Support offerings include Ask a Tax pro, via phone or email. Premium and Self-employed packages offer to put you at the front of the support queue, at least relative to the Classic version. You can get started with the program right now.\n\nFree Tax USA: Online only. One of the cheapest offerings, with the only pay version being Deluxe, at $7 (no downloads offered). State filings are $13 extra. Support includes online chat between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. ET, Monday through Friday, but only for the Deluxe version, not for the free offering. Similar to Tax Slayer, a priority feature puts you ahead in the support queue relative to users of the free version. A bonus is the ability to file \"unlimited amended returns\" at \"no extra cost.\" You can get started with the program right now.\n\nLiberty Tax/eSmart Tax: Online only. Listed prices range from $20 for EZ to $75 for Premium (no downloads offered). eTax pricing is slightly cheaper, while functionality appears to be comparable. It has a limited-function smartphone app, which is just a directory of Liberty Tax offices around the country. Support includes online text chat from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ET, and a network of CPA offices throughout the country. Promises \"360-degree support\" and \"multichannel support.\"\n\nJackson Hewitt: Online only. There's a free tier for individuals with simple returns, but most will need the $30 package, which adds $37 per each state filing. It has a nationwide network of CPAs, though \"separate charges apply\" for such visits. It promises to pay any penalties and interest incurred with filings, a money-back guarantee if you find a better refund, and a refund of any fees incurred if you end up not filing with the program.\n\nFree1040TaxReturn: Online only. Listed prices include $30 for each federal or state e-filing, $7 for print-only preparations. Support includes a 24/7 help desk by phone or email. It offers federal and state \"audit insurance\" for an additional $30 and $20, respectively.\n\nHappy Tax Service: Online or mobile. The most expensive of the bunch, with prices from $100 for a Starter package on up to $500 for Premium. All versions include one free state filing. It has a franchise network of CPAs and EAs billed as a \"concierge service.\" You get an initial meeting in person to complete forms, then a CPA prepares your paperwork and delivers the finished product in 2 hours, on average. It has an extensive selection of packages for cryptocurrency tax filings.\n\nUnderstanding the Tax Act\n\nAssuming you decide to go through the online process to ease most of the pain, you should be aware of some of the basics of the TCJA that may affect you. The IRS has provided a handy document (PDF) explaining these items, and you'll also want to check your individual state tax website.\n\nThe most obvious changes are new tax rates and new amounts for the standard deduction.\n\nThe new rates are 10, 12, 22, 24, 32, 35 and 37 percent.\n\nThe new deductions are $12,000 for single filers or those who are married but filing separately, up from $6,350 last year; $24,000 for those filing jointly, up from $12,700; and $18,000 for a head of household, up from $9,350.\n\nIf you're itemizing taxes, rather than taking the standard deduction, those change as well. The good news is you may be able to deduct more than in past years, if you're in a higher income bracket. The bar has been set lower for deducting some unreimbursed medical expenses as well. Rules for deductions of mortgages and home equity interest also change. The credit for a qualifying child in a household goes up this year, and there's a new credit that can be claimed for other dependents.\n\nThe new tax forms won't appear until the end of December or early January. Believe it or not, some changes to the forms are supposed to actually make things easier. For example, the IRS has been working on a new version of the core 1040 form that is half the size of the old form, and also replaces forms 1040A and 1040EZ.\n\nIf you want a sneak peek, a draft version was posted over the summer on the IRS website (PDF). A plethora of other draft releases are available on the site.\n\nOne matter you may want to get started on right away is withholding. Rules for employer withholding have changed and the IRS advises that you review how much is being withheld from your paycheck, to avoid a large bill at tax time if the amount is too low. There's an online calculator at the IRS website, as part of a \"Paycheck Checkup\" that breaks down the TCJA changes for you.\n\nTax software offerings\n\nThere are a few basic distinguishing factors for all the services: pricing, level of \"live\" or human assistance, and insurance or guarantees.\n\nThe programs are evolving from an era of software on CD-ROM (for those of you who remember what that is) to the web and smartphone apps. Three providers -- Intuit's TurboTax, TaxAct Online and H&R Block -- still offer software that can be either downloaded and installed locally on your Mac or PC, or even sent to you on CD.\n\nWant to file taxes on your iPhone ( )? Six providers offer fully functioning mobile apps for Apple's iOS or for Android-based smartphones that will let you file taxes from the palm of your hand: Intuit, TaxAct, H&R, Tax Slayer, Credit Karma and Happy Tax Service.\n\nThe new trend is hands-on support. Intuit's TurboTax is for the first time including a free conversation with a certified public accountant, or CPA, when you're in the process of filling out forms on the TurboTax website, as opposed to the download, known as TurboTax Live. When you create your account on the Turbo Tax site, and begin to fill in information about your finances, a button appears in the upper right-hand corner saying Live Tax Advice. Clicking on that brings up a one-way video window -- you see the tax expert, they don't see you. Screen-sharing technology lets the CPA look at the statements with you in real time.\n\nH&R Block, which has a network of offices throughout the US, offers to have your \"work checked\" for you, called the Tax Pro Review. It has offered that service, albeit under different branding, since 2004.\n\nTax Slayer offers to connect you via either chat or telephone to \"on-staff IRS-enrolled agents.\"\n\nAnd Free Tax USA offers online chat with a \"tax specialist\" between the hours of 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. ET.\n\nLiberty Tax and Jackson Hewitt are two other firms that, like H&R, have actual physical offices around the country, though it's not immediately clear what that will get you. Liberty promises \"360-degree, multichannel\" support, without specifying what that means in practice. Jackson Hewitt notes that \"separate charges may apply\" for visiting its walk-in offices, without specifying any amounts.\n\nLive help is of course, for the most part, a feature of paid offerings, and there are a variety of other features that the vendors use to move you from the free offering. Which kind of filer you are -- single, head of household, married but filing separately and so on -- obviously starts to move you into packages that can handle more complicated returns.\n\nOther benefits of using a paid version include the ability to go back and amend filings after you've filed them.\n\nGuarantees and the fine print\n\nThe other big lures for paying are the so-called guarantees. This can be where the fine print becomes especially tricky.\n\nEvery one of the 11 providers listed here offers some kind of assurance of accuracy. The most common form is to guarantee that if another tax software is able to produce a higher refund, then the vendor will refund you what you paid them. TaxAct Online offers to also pay the difference between what it found for you and what another program found for you, up to the amount of $100,000. Obviously, this implies that you'll be using more than one of these programs to file, which is probably not the case for most people, which is why such a promise seems a low-risk proposition for the vendors.\n\nAnother guarantee is to reimburse you for any penalties incurred by filing with the vendor. TurboTax states flatly it will \"pay you the penalty and interest\" incurred. Another is audit support, but what that means varies. TurboTax says if a return filed with it is audited, it'll refund the software fees, but it won't be involved with your audit. TaxAct will refund audit costs up to $100,000.\n\nTurboTax also offers a separate package, called Max Defend & Restore, which is provided through a partnership with a firm called TaxAudit.com. The Max plan, which is a $45 add-on, promises to have a tax expert defend you should you be \"randomly audited,\" and promises a $250,000 insurance policy against identity theft.\n\nFree Tax USA will provide you help from an \"audit specialist\" if you use its Deluxe edition, rather than free, but won't pay for any of your costs. If it's something you're really worried about, the one vendor that explicitly offers a product to cover things is Free1040, which sells federal and state audit insurance, for $30 and $20, respectively. These are billed as \"insurance to cover the cost of defending yourself,\" and the service promises its CPAs and EAs, meaning \"enrolled agents,\" people who've passed a test from the IRS or served at the IRS, will \"handle the entire process\" so you \"won't have to see the IRS.\"\n\nPricing depends on many factors\n\nThe prices for all these packages range from completely free, with Credit Karma, which doesn't charge for any offering, on up to several hundred dollars for Happy Tax, a firm that is really a network of CPAs and EAs. In all cases, you don't pay anything for the service up-front, you pay when you file. And most of the vendors let you pay for the service by having the fee deducted from a refund, if you're due one. Prices for the download or CD-based versions are generally a little higher than for online. The smartphone apps are free to download to your mobile, and the ultimate price is in line with the online price of whatever package you choose.\n\nThe question of pricing is more complex than it initially appears, however, because the prices for many of the offerings are not fixed at this point in time. What's listed on the websites of the vendors are often prices based on last year's software. Intuit, makers of TurboTax, for example, told me that prices for TurboTax you'll pay to file in April of next year are \"subject to change,\" and that what is listed on the website is the cost of last year's return. \"Prices are based on when you actually file,\" says Intuit.\n\nSimilarly, H&R Block said that \"prices have at times changed in late March/early April.\"\n\nThe direction of pricing will likely be up, not down. Liberty Tax, for example, lets you start the online process, and then midway through, tells you to click a button to proceed to the next step and \"lock in your rate.\" But once you do so, you're presented with a menu of prices that are actually higher than what's listed on the home page. For example, the EZ version, listed for $12 on the home page, is listed in the wizard as $20. Liberty says it hasn't yet updated its home page for the new prices.\n\nAll these services will let you get started with a free version. Even Liberty Tax, which doesn't specifically offer a free version, allows you to get started entering information before deciding on a product.\n\nIf you do start with a free version, you'll find there are frequent inducements to upgrade to the paid versions, or, if you started by choosing a paid version, to upgrade to higher packages. For example, if you recently changed your work status from self-employed to freelance, you may be prompted to upgrade to a package that will help you itemize all the new expenses you pay for as your own boss, such as your monthly internet bill or supplies costs.\n\nGiven the shifting nature of prices at this point in time, you have an intriguing opportunity: start your return with multiple vendors, try them out and dump the ones you don't like before you file.\n\nBear in mind that almost all the services require an extra fee to file state returns, and an additional fee for each extra federal filing on top of the initial one. There's a whole other set of fees if you wish to go back and do your federal or state taxes from prior years.\n\nAdditional benefits\n\nOne emerging feature of the services, supported so far only by a couple, is special treatment of cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. TurboTax offers to \"accurately account for gains and losses from cryptocurrency transactions\" as a unique feature of its $140 Deluxe package. And Happy Tax has a whole slate of offerings that vary in price by the number of transactions you're accounting for. The Happy Tax packages are quite expensive, however, ranging from $600 on up to $3,500, billed on a yearly basis.\n\nRegardless of the features of each service, some people find it easier to come back to a vendor they've used before. If you're a prior-year customer of TurboTax, for example, as soon as you choose a package this time around, the software tells you it's going to import last year's return automatically, which can save you some time having to bring together the prior-year filing. That's important for a variety of reasons. As just one example, if you received any refunds for the prior year, it has to be determined whether they're taxable or not.\n\nRemember that if you're making a more modest income, the IRS offers help for electronic filing. One option is a team of volunteer tax preparers who will help people making $54,000 or less, called VITA and TCE. More about that on the IRS site here.\n\nThe other is Free File, an initiative begun in 2003 for those making $66,000 or less annually. Free File offers you a menu of software from several of the vendors on this list, including Intuit TurboTax, H&R Block and TaxAct.\n\nGetting started\n\nThough many people will delay filing until the very last minute, some of the services will allow you to get started today, for no money up-front, even before the new forms are available, and before you receive many of the documents you need, such as a W2. A benefit of this approach is that it's possible to try the initial stages of all the online versions before you commit to a purchase, and get a feel for how well the user interface suits your needs.\n\nThe process in all cases begins by entering an email address, choosing a user ID and coming up with a password. You may find yourself having to keep track of multiple passwords, given that creating a password is one of the first stages. For that reason, you'll either want to keep a notepad handy to write down your passwords, or else turn on the ability of your browser to save passwords for websites. (Learn more about password managers here.)\n\nThe system will usually send a confirmation code via text message to a mobile phone that you enter. (In the case of Liberty Tax, email is used instead.) You'll want to keep your phone handy so you can enter the code to continue.\n\nYou can walk away from the return, and come back at a later time, log in with the ID and password you created, and pick it up again, and the work you've done will be saved. In some cases, when you return to the site, after you log in, you'll again be sent a one-time code, via email or SMS, that you'll have to enter into the site to resume working.\n\nYou'll be asked in all cases to choose and answer three security questions, for which you'll also want to keep notes.\n\nIn the case of Credit Karma, you'll also be asked to enter the last four digits of your social security number, and to then confirm some background data on yourself, such as whether you had a mortgage loan outstanding. These are presented to verify your identity, the company says.\n\nIf you're filing with the provider for the first time, expect to enter information about filing status, and whether you have any dependents or can be claimed by anyone as a dependent.\n\nIf you're starting fresh with one of the services, you'll be prompted early on to import your prior-year filing, usually in the form of a PDF file, by uploading it through the browser. Of course, W-2 forms aren't required to be delivered to employees until the end of January, and additional tax documents (for stocks, 401Ks and so forth) often don't arrive until the middle of February. But whether you're ready to start or not, it's good to begin gathering the documents you need, to try out the look and feel of the offerings, and to start to reflect on just how complex your return may be this year.\n\nOriginally published Dec. 13, 2018.\n\nUpdate, March 14: Noted that there's only about one month until the tax deadline.\n\nUpdate, Jan. 21: Added note about how government shutdown may affect tax preparations.\n\nUpdate, Jan. 14: Slightly updated to reflect changes in software and service availability and pricing.",

Ride-sharing app Lyft priced its initial public offering Thursday at $72 per share, giving the company a valuation of $21 billion. The company was known as a \"unicorn\" for being privately held and worth over $1 billion. To mark Lyft's IPO, we compiled a list of the 15 biggest unicorns, many of which are also contemplating to go public.

    "description": "President Donald Trump on Monday will ask the U.S. Congress for an additional $8.6 billion to help pay for the wall he promised to build on the southern border with Mexico to combat illegal immigration and drug trafficking, officials familiar with his 2020 bu\u2026",
    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Monday will ask the U.S. Congress for an additional $8.6 billion to help pay for his promised wall on the U.S-Mexico border to combat illegal immigration and drug trafficking, officials familiar with his 2020 budget request told Reuters.\n\nThe demand, which drew swift criticism from Democrats, is more than six times what Congress allocated for border projects in each of the past two fiscal years, and 6 percent more than Trump has corralled by invoking emergency powers this year.\n\nDemocrats, who oppose the wall as unnecessary and immoral, control the U.S. House of Representatives, making it unlikely the Republican president\u2019s request will win congressional passage. Republicans control the Senate.\n\nThe proposal comes on the heels of a bruising battle with Congress over wall funding that resulted in a five-week partial federal government shutdown that ended in January, and could touch off a sequel just ahead of a trifecta of ominous fiscal deadlines looming this fall.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump hurt millions of Americans and caused widespread chaos when he recklessly shut down the government to try to get his expensive and ineffective wall,\u201d said Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer in a joint statement on Sunday.\n\n\u201cCongress refused to fund his wall and he was forced to admit defeat and reopen the government. The same thing will repeat itself if he tries this again. We hope he learned his lesson,\u201d said the two top Democrats in Congress.\n\nAsked on Fox News Sunday about the new wall funding request and if there would be another budget fight, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said, \u201cI suppose there will be ... He\u2019s going to stay with his wall and he\u2019s going to stay with the border security theme. I think it\u2019s essential.\u201d\n\nBroadly speaking on the budget, Kudlow told Fox, \u201cThe president is proposing roughly a 5 percent across-the-board reduction in domestic spending accounts.\u201d\n\nRegardless of whether Congress passes it, the budget request could help Trump frame his argument on border security as the 2020 presidential race begins to take shape, with the president seeking re-election.\n\n\u201cBuild the wall\u201d was one of his signature campaign pledges in his first run for office in 2016. \u201cFinish the wall\u201d is already a feature of his re-election campaign, a rallying cry plastered across banners and signs at his campaign rallies.\n\n\u201cIt gives the president the ability to say he has fulfilled his commitment to gain operational control of the southwest border,\u201d an administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said of the budget request.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump gestures during a rally at El Paso County Coliseum in El Paso, Texas, U.S., February 11, 2019. REUTERS/Leah Millis/File Photo\n\n\u201cWe have provided the course of action, the strategy and the request to finish the job. It\u2019s a question of, will Congress allow us to finish the job,\u201d a second administration official said.\n\nFunding legislation needs to be passed before Oct. 1 - the start of the 2020 federal fiscal year - or the government could shut down again. If Congress and the White House fail to agree to lift mandatory spending caps set in a 2011 law, steep automatic cuts in many programs would kick in. Around the same time, Trump and lawmakers must agree to lift the debt ceiling, or risk a default, which would have chaotic economic fallout.\n\n722 MILES OF WALL\n\nTrump\u2019s wall request is based off a 2017 plan put forward by Customs and Border Protection officials to build or replace 722 miles (1,162 km) of barrier along the border, which in total is estimated to cost about $18 billion.\n\nSo far, only 111 miles (179 km) have been built or are under way, officials said. In fiscal 2017, $341 million in funding was allocated for 40 miles (64 km) of wall, and in 2018, another $1.375 billion was directed to 82 miles (132 km).\n\nFor fiscal 2019, Trump demanded $5.7 billion in wall funds, but Congress appropriated only $1.375 billion for border fencing projects.\n\nFollowing the rejection of his wall funding demand, Trump declared the border was a national emergency - a move opposed by Democrats and some Republicans - and redirected $601 million in Treasury Department forfeiture funds, $2.5 billion in Defense Department drug interdiction funds and $3.6 billion from a military construction budget, for total spending of $8.1 billion for the wall.\n\nThe administration has not estimated how far the 2019 funds will go, but officials said average costs are about $25 million per mile (1.6 km).\n\nTrump\u2019s $8.6 billion in proposed wall funding for fiscal 2020 would include $5 billion from the Department of Homeland Security budget and $3.6 billion from the Pentagon\u2019s military construction budget. The budget proposal will also include another $3.6 million in military construction funding to make up for any projects delayed by the wall, officials said.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security is one of a few priority areas to get a boost in Trump\u2019s budget plan, which seeks to slash funding to many non-defense programs.\n\nTrump will propose an overall 5 percent increase to the Department of Homeland Security budget over fiscal 2019 appropriations, including $3.3 billion, or 22 percent more, for Customs and Border Protection, and $1.2 billion more for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a 16 percent hike, officials said.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The prototypes for U.S. President Donald Trump's border wall are seen behind the border fence between Mexico and the United States, in Tijuana, Mexico January 7, 2019. REUTERS/Jorge Duenes/File Photo\n\nThe budget proposal includes a plan to hire more than 2,800 law enforcement and support personnel for the agencies, and 100 immigration judge teams, officials said.\n\nTrump faces both political and court battles to free up the money he wants for the current fiscal year. Many lawmakers accused Trump of overstepping his constitutional powers by declaring an emergency to free up the funds. The House has already voted to revoke the emergency, and the Senate is likely to do the same this week. Trump is expected to veto the resolution.\n\nA coalition of state governments led by California has sued Trump to block the emergency move, though legal experts have said the lawsuits face a difficult road.",

    "text": "Some HP laptops continue to suffer from faulty batteries that may cause \u201cfire and burn damage,\u201d according to the US Consumer Product Safety Commission. As noted by CNET and Tom\u2019s Hardware, this most recent HP battery recall was first initiated in January of 2018 and then expanded in January of this year, but that most recent development failed to make headlines because the government shutdown interfered with the CPSC\u2019s ability to communicate the expansion.\n\n\u201cThis recall expansion was previously announced independently on January 17, 2019 by the firm due to US government furlough,\u201d reads the CPSC\u2019s website dedicated to the HP recall, which was updated on Tuesday of this week to include news of the most recent January 2019 expansion.\n\nThe new recall date is now March 12th, 2019, and it includes an additional 28,500 laptop battery units on top of the 50,000 initially announced back in early 2018. According to the CPSC, \u201cHP has received eight new reports of battery packs in the US overheating, melting, or charring, including one report of minor injury and two reports of property damage totaling $1,100.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a full list of the models, which includes some laptops HP sold as early as April 2015 and as late as December of last year:\n\nThe recall expansion involves lithium-ion batteries for HP commercial notebook computers and mobile workstations were sold to businesses and other organizations. The batteries were shipped with or sold as accessories for HP ProBooks (64x G2 and G3 series, 65x G2 and G3 series, 4xx G4 series), HPx360 (310 G2), HP Pavilion x360 11inch Notebook PC, HP 11 Notebook PC, HP ZBook (17 G3, and Studio G3) mobile workstations. The batteries were also sold as accessories or replacement batteries for the HP ZBook Studio G4 mobile workstation, HP ProBook 4xx G5 series, HP ENVY 15, HP Mobile Thin Clients (mt21, mt22, and mt31), or for any of the products listed above.\n\nFaulty battery woes have long plagued HP laptops, with seemingly annual recall announcements and expansions dating back to 2016 and totaling nearly 250,000 units. It\u2019s not exactly clear what the main issue is here. But HP has a website set up for helping customers figure out if their computer has a faulty battery and guiding them through the process of submitting it for a complimentary replacement.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article said HP is recalling laptops. That is incorrect; HP is recalling laptop batteries, not the computers themselves. The headline has been updated to reflect this fact. We regret the error.",

    "description": "Strategists at JPMorgan scoured more than 25,000 earnings transcripts for hints of what the future holds for corporate America. The firm identified five major themes that popped up repeatedly. Understanding how these forces can impact companies will be crucia\u2026",
    "text": "No amount of independent financial analysis is enough to truly understand what's going on in the global business landscape. At a certain point, you have to listen to what the companies themselves are saying.\n\nJPMorgan is well aware of this fact, which is why the firm recently scoured more than 25,000 corporate earnings transcripts for hints of what the future holds.\n\nBut before we get into the major takeaways from JPMorgan's analysis, let's set the scene in markets.\n\nStocks are off to a torrid pace this year after nearly slipping into a bear market in late December. The benchmark S&P 500 has rallied 12% in 2019, led by cyclical equities.\n\nAnd according to JPMorgan, the next few months could be even brighter. The firm notes that stock positioning is \"still relatively light,\" leaving room for upside. JPMorgan also says most retail investors have stayed on the sidelines during the year-to-date recovery, which means the market could be pushed higher once they decide to participate.\n\nWith JPMorgan's constructive outlook established, let's take a look at the five major themes the firm uncovered when digging through earnings calls. Any one of them could very well dictate whether JPMorgan's bull case comes to fruition.\n\n1) Tariffs\n\nThis is perhaps the most timely market catalyst, considering new headlines from over the weekend suggesting that a trade-war resolution is near. Even before this latest progress, JPMorgan found that corporate tariff worries had subdued somewhat, most likely because investors had become well-versed in the situation.\n\n\"In regards to supply chain, companies are not committing significant capital for shifting production capacity at this point,\" Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, JPMorgan's chief US equity strategist, wrote in a recent client note. \"Instead, they are managing tariffs by raising prices where possible, idling and shifting production to geographies unaffected by tariffs, and/or passing cost to suppliers.\"\n\nHe continued, laying out his bull case: \"If a trade deal materializes, it will remove uncertainty and could be a source of positive revisions since this catalyst is mostly not in consensus numbers.\"\n\nThe chart below shows which industries are most concerned about tariffs, based on the number of times the word was mentioned on earnings calls.\n\nJPMorgan\n\n2) Input costs\n\nJPMorgan notes that input costs \u2014 like energy or raw-materials prices \u2014 have also been a concern for corporations. That said, the firm prefers to view it in tandem with trade concerns, since they're so intertwined.\n\n\"While input costs remain a key topic for US corporates in aggregate, the fears transitioned from passing down commodity related inflation (e.g., transportation, energy prices, raw materials) to trade and tariff related costs,\" Lakos-Bujas said.\n\nHe continued: \"However, after a sharp decline in crude (-40% in 4Q) and more broadly S&P GSCI (-20%), local producers received some relief.\"\n\nThe chart below shows that automobile companies are the most worried about this particular driver.\n\nGoldman Sachs\n\n3) Rising wages\n\nJPMorgan was actually surprised by the results for this search term. The firm says a declining number of S&P 500 companies are highlighting rising wages as a risk, despite assertions to the contrary over the past few months.\n\nAt the heart of JPMorgan's view on the matter is the difference between labor-intensive industries and those that are more skilled. Or, more specifically, how much respective influence those groups exert on the overall market.\n\n\"Since the latter makes up ~60% of S&P 500 market cap (and growing), the expanding labor market should be a net positive for S&P 500 profits through rising demand/revenue, which should more than offset wage pressures at this point in the cycle,\" Lakos-Bujas said.\n\n4) Geopolitical risks\n\nJPMorgan notes that, in the fourth quarter, discussion of geopolitical risk spiked to its highest levels in five years. More specifically, the firm noticed an uptick in the energy, tech hardware, banks, and transportation sectors.\n\nSimply knowing which areas of the market think they're most at-risk \u2014 stripped out conveniently in the chart below \u2014 can be valuable for investors looking to avoid an unpredictable geopolitical overhang.\n\n\"In particular, Energy companies discussed the negative impacts of geopolitics on oil supply and demand sentiment and some delays in regulatory approvals driven by the government shutdown\" Lakos-Bujas said.\n\nJPMorgan\n\n5) US dollar\n\nJPMorgan says discussion of the greenback increased for the industrials, materials, consumer staples, and technology sectors. This can be seen in the chart below.\n\nGoing beyond sector-specific concerns, JPMorgan highlights a weaker US dollar as possibly being a positive catalyst for stocks.\n\n\"We estimate that every ~2% decline in the US dollar trade-weighted index is ~1% upside for S&P 500 EPS,\" Lakos-Bujas said. \"If US dollar were to stabilize or begin a structural decline, this multi-year drag for US Multinationals could become a tailwind.\"",

    "title": "Pinterest drops its IPO filing",
    "description": "The visual search engine will go public on the NYSE in an offering expected next month.",
    "text": "Pinterest, the nearly decade-old visual search engine, has unveiled its S-1 as it prepares for an initial public offering expected in April.\n\nValued at $12.3 billion in 2017, Pinterest took its first official step toward a 2019 IPO two months ago, hiring Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase as lead underwriters for its NYSE offering. Now it\u2019s giving us a closer look at its financials.\n\nThe San Francisco-based company, which will trade under the ticker symbol \u201cPINS,\u201d posted revenue of $755.9 million in the year ending December 31, 2018, up from $472.8 million in 2017. It has roughly doubled its monthly active user count since early 2016, hitting 265 million late last year. The company\u2019s net loss, meanwhile, shrank to $62.9 million last year from $130 million in 2017.\n\nIn total, Pinterest has posted $1.525 billion in revenue since 2016.\n\nPinterest has similarly raised around $1.5 billion from VCs, listing both early and late-stage investors on its cap table. The company\u2019s key stakeholders include Bessemer Venture Partners, FirstMark Capital, Andreessen Horowitz, Fidelity and Valiant Capital Partners, though the filing doesn\u2019t state the percent ownership of each of these entities.\n\nPinterest counts more than 250 million monthly active users, bringing in some $700 million in ad revenue in 2018, per reports, a 50 percent increase year-over-year. The business employs 1,600 people across 13 cities, including Chicago, London, Paris, S\u00e3o Paulo, Berlin and Tokyo. Per the filing, Pinterest has signed a lease for a brand new San Francisco headquarters, which will be constructed near its current HQ.\n\nThe company\u2019s global average revenue per user (ARPU) in the year ended December 31, 2018 was $3.14, up 25 percent YoY. Its U.S. ARPU, meanwhile, sat at $9.04, a 47 percent increase from the prior year.\n\nPinterest emerged in 2010 as a buzzy social media startup and mobile app meant for sharing inspirational images and quotes. Under the leadership of co-founder and chief executive officer Ben Silbermann, it has expanded over the years as it has attempted to monetize the platform, which relies on ad revenue to stay afloat. Last fall, in a bid to turn more of its users into shoppers (and compete with Instagram), the company rebuilt the infrastructure behind its product pins. The update brought to the app up-to-date pricing and stock information on all product pins, links directly to retailers, a new \u201cProducts like this\u201d category under each fashion and home decor pin and other user-friendly tweaks.\n\nPinterest\u2019s IPO paperwork emerged just hours after another tech unicorn, Zoom, filed to go public. Several billion-dollar tech companies have made the choice to IPO in 2019, even after a weeks-long government shutdown caused a significant delay in offerings. Pinterest follows Lyft, which unveiled its S-1 and nearly $1 billion in 2018 losses just three weeks ago. Uber and Slack are both expected to make their IPO paperwork available to the public soon.\n\nPinterest may be looking to benefit off the 2019 IPO hype spearheaded by Uber and Lyft, though The Information has previously reported Pinterest\u2019s offering could suffer because it\u2019s a social media business, which means it\u2019s often compared to the likes of Facebook and Twitter, a pair of companies that have repeatedly raised concerns about user privacy.\n\nWe\u2019ll have to wait a few more weeks to get a better understanding of Wall Street\u2019s demand for Pinterest. If it\u2019s anything like Lyft\u2019s IPO, which is already over-subscribed, the company will fare just fine.\n\nThis story is updating.",

    "text": "Target chief Brian Cornell tempered his statements about the strength of American shoppers on Tuesday, months after making a bold call that the consumer environment was \"perhaps the strongest I've seen in my career.\"\n\n\"It's still a very stable consumer environment. Consumers are shopping. You're seeing strong consumer confidence, still,\" Cornell told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" on Tuesday.\n\n\"Certainly, we're going to watch it carefully,\" Cornell added, referring to consumer buying trends. \"It's going to ebb and flow. But right now, I think we're seeing a very consistent consumer environment.\"\n\nCornell, who became chairman and CEO of Target in 2014 after more than three decades at other retail and consumer products companies, was interviewed shortly after Target delivered better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings, revenue and same-store sales growth, as well as a rosier full-year outlook.\n\nBased on shares rising 5 percent on Tuesday, Target was up about 27 percent since its Christmas Eve low, including 15.7 percent in 2019. That compares with the S&P 500's nearly 19 percent gain since Christmas Eve, with 11.4 percent of that advance coming this year.\n\nIn August, when stocks and consumer confidence were climbing, Cornell told analysts, \"There's no doubt that, like others, we're currently benefiting from a very strong consumer environment \u2014 perhaps the strongest I've seen in my career.\"\n\nThen in late October, Cornell stood by those remarks, telling CNBC he saw no change in how Americans feel about their finances, despite sharp declines in the stock market at the time and evidence that some pockets of the economy may be slowing.\n\nDuring the October interview, he also acknowledged the need to look at 2019 and beyond due to \"some concerns about overall global trends,\" but said then that consumer sentiment remained \"very high.\"\n\nBut consumer confidence, as measured by the Conference Board research firm, declined in November and December as stocks tanked in the final three months of 2018. Consumer confidence fell again in January as Americans dealt with uncertainty around the partial government shutdown, which turned out to be the longest ever. However, in February, with the shutdown over and stocks sharply rebounding in the opening two months of 2019, consumer confidence bounced higher.\n\nThroughout the market and consumer confidence slides in late 2018 and rebounds in early 2019, the labor market remained relatively strong. The government releases its latest employment report Friday, with economists expecting 180,000 nonfarm jobs to have been added in February and the unemployment rate dipping to 3.9 percent.

The payroll gains reported by the Labor Department were the weakest since September 2017.\n\nThe weak U.S. report added to economic fears also fanned by a sharp fall in China\u2019s exports and after the European Central Bank slashed growth forecasts for the region on Thursday.\n\n\u201cPeople are worried about the jobs report and global growth in general and that is pushing markets lower,\u201d said Brent Schutte, chief investment strategist at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company in Milwaukee.\n\nBut Schutte added, \u201cTo me, the jobs number is not a sign of impending doom...I think the jobs report is heavily affected by the government shutdown and other seasonal distortions.\u201d\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 150.33 points, or 0.59 percent, to 25,322.9, the S&P 500 lost 20.94 points, or 0.76 percent, to 2,727.99 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 53.70 points, or 0.72 percent, to 7,367.77.\n\nThe S&P 500 hit its lowest point in nearly a month.\n\nThe closely watched Dow Jones Transport Average was off 1.2 percent, falling for an 11th straight session.\n\nThe recent pullback has paused a rally to start 2019 that has been fueled by optimism over a U.S.-China trade deal and by beliefs the Federal Reserve will be less aggressive in raising interest rates.

    "description": "",
    "text": "WHEN: Today, Friday, March 8, 2019\n\nWHERE: CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\"\n\nThe following is the unofficial transcript of a FIRST ON CNBC interview with National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow on CNBC's \"Squawk on the Street\" today, Friday, March 8th. The following is a link to video of the interview on CNBC.com: https://www.cnbc.com/video/2019/03/08/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-larry-kudlow-following-weak-jobs-data.html.\n\nAll references must be sourced to CNBC.\n\nCARL QUINTANILLA: Back to today's other big story, of course, job creation really grinded to a halt in February. Labor Department says nonfarm payrolls is up just 20k. That's the worst month since September of 2017, even as the unemployment rates drops to 3.8. Joining us with the reaction from the White House today, National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow. Larry, great to have you back. Good morning.\n\nLARRY KUDLOW: Good morning, Carl. You know, I was there in the Roman Empire. It wasn't all that great. We should really put -- have some perspective on it.\n\nCARL QUINTANILLA: You in the robes\u2014I've got to see. Pics or it didn't happen. Larry, help us understand 20,000. How did this happen?\n\nLARRY KUDLOW: I think it is a very flukey number. It is interesting that 20,000 there, the household employment number from which unemployment comes was up 255, which is a great number. The unemployment rate fell right .2 from 4 to 3.8. Wages were up, actually a big wage number year on year, 3.4%. Look, I think you have timing issues with respect to the government shutdown. Winter, seasonal issues. Very flukey. I wouldn't pay attention to it to be honest with you.\n\nJIM CRAMER: Well, Larry, it is Jim. I want to -- I totally share your view. I want to be able to defend the number as a way to be able to say: there was weather and this time you really got to take weather seriously. But I wonder, Larry, at what point are some of these woes from overseas are we importing? I know we're going to import a lot from that deficit number but are we importing Brexit, are we importing worries in Germany, are we importing the issues that are hurting China? Because I don't want those to impact us. Because they don't necessarily reflect anything other than United States being a little more ascendant than they are.\n\nLARRY KUDLOW: Look, well, that last point is an important point. We're the fastest growing economy in the world from the major economies. And you mentioned Europe, the United States is buying goods. We are really the only source of stimulus. I mean, let's take Europe, it's a big trading partner, so, we're buying -- we're importing their consumer goods, importing their capital goods. We're importing their manufacturing goods, and that's, you know, they need that demand. If it weren't for us, they would be in worse shape. Probably negative across the board. They can keep throwing money at it, as Mr. Draghi is. Now more easy money lending to the banks. That's not going to do it. They have been doing this for years. They need changes in their labor regulations, they need lower marginal tax rates, et cetera, et cetera. We are the source of stimulus. We are the hottest economy in the world. And we are expensing, despite the silly, flukey number, we are on a roll and I'm going to say that the outlook for the American economy is still 3% growth plus.\n\nDAVID FABER: Really? That's \u2013 that was my question, Larry. You called a silly flukey number, so you don't believe it is reflective of all of a slowdown in growth?\n\nLARRY KUDLOW: No. I don't think it is reflective of anything, except you have timing issues and scoring issues and eligibility issues and lousy winter seasonal issues. Again, this is all going to be revised up. You can use a three-month moving average. I think jobs are about 190,000 plus. Look at the house hold survey. That's where the unemployment rates come from. That thing was up, if i have it right, 255,000. So, your unemployment rate comes down from 4 to 3.8 and your wage numbers are up, I believe, .4%, 3.4% year on year. Those are really, really big numbers. And, again, you may not see it in this month, monthly data is monthly data, there's a lot of noise, but the trend lines are so important, the biggest factor in the growth of jobs in the past year is, guess what, women. Women have come back into the labor force. I don't know what the number is, 50 something percent, 57% or 58% of the new entrants in the labor force from women. That's a big turnaround from the last 15 or 16 years. And then of course, as we've discussed on this show, blue collar. Blue collar employment, manufacturing, autos and so forth. Fastest gains since the '80s. And the Blue Collar wages are rising faster than the White Collar wages. I'm not saying higher, I'm just saying faster. These are great things and, by the way, one last number, I just want to put this in, the best number I've seen all week: productivity, output per hour. That is the ultimate growth driver in our economy at least. Productivity is up 1.8% for the last four quarters in 2018. That's a big number. Because that thing had been flat, zero or near zero for many years. That tells you a number of things, okay. I think that lower tax rates and deregulation is working. But it shows you that money is being invested, businesses are investing, new equipment, new campuses, new everything, new robots, you were talking about AI before, that's a big number. 1.8% productivity growth changes the whole potential of the economy to grow. It is a terrific number. Much more important than today's payroll number.\n\nJIM CRAMER: Alright. So, Larry, I like that, I likethe women, that's important for the International Women's Day. Of course, the participation is terrific. But at what point, Larry, can we say, 'Things are good here, things have slowed down in China, down 20% in that -- for heaven's sake. And a remarkable number.' at what point do you go to the President and say, 'Listen, you know, we got plenty of time, don't have to hurry this, we're winning, they're losing.'\n\nLARRY KUDLOW: Well, look, we have come a long way in those talks. I'm not sure I have any new news to add particularly. We are still negotiating by phone and teleconference. The documents from two weeks ago advanced enormously. That's why the President is optimistic about the potential for a deal. We're still looking at the structural issues. We're looking at the enforcement issues. We're looking at the commodity issues. I don't want to hang a timetable on this. Ambassador Lighthizer is doing the best he can. There may be a meeting down in Florida, in Mar-A-Lago, between the two leaders, maybe late this month or early next month. Nothing in cement. But there's a lot of talk about a meeting. They're moving along very nicely. They're moving along very nicely and they're covering more ground than ever before. And, look, Jimmy, you're right, China's economy, there's two things going on here: one is the business cycle is lousy. The recent data is lousy the stock market has come back this year, but it had been performing very badly. But there is a long-term problem here. China had been departing from its market based reforms that helped them grow in the '80s and '90s and early 2000s. They've been moving in the wrong direction, they've been moving away to a more authoritarian economy and political story. That's hurt them. Direct investment has slowed down enormously and they've had to fight to keep the Yuan Renminbi steady. Now, we have hurt them, I think. President Trump's negotiating strategy, tough, aggressive, tariffs are part of his strategy, so they have come to the negotiating table to talk about more things, more seriously than ever before. So, you're right, we have them over a barrel. On the other hand, we would like a good deal, both countries should benefit, but I must say, as the President has said, and he's very serious, if we don't get a good deal for the United States and its workforce and its Blue Collar people, and its ranchers, and its technology, you know, they got stop stealing our technology -- if we don't get a good deal, then we won't get a good deal. And you saw him walk away from North Korea \u2013 I'm just saying that's a directive moment, it could apply to trade, I'm not forecasting. I'm just saying, it has got to be a good deal for the USA.\n\nCARL QUINTANILLA: And if it is not, Larry, if you do walk, then what are we left with? I mean, tariffs go to 25. trade deficit continues to grow. Our Budget deficit continues to rise 70% year on year. Then what?\n\nLARRY KUDLOW: Well, I don't want to do what ifs because I'm not predicting that we'll walk away. I'm just saying, the President made it clear how tough a negotiator he can be. The tariffs were one illustration of that and the North Korean -- I call it a directive moment, is another. I'm not suggesting that's going to happen. I'm not here to announce that. I don't want anyone to misinterpret. We are actually all, in the senior government, we are all relatively optimistic. But, again our conditions have to be met. And there have to be big changes in the IP theft, you know this issue as well as we do, in the force transfer of technology, in the ownership provisions, and in the enforcement provisions. But having said that, Carl, we have a lot of really good stuff on the table. The documents are very good. I'm not here to reveal the details. But I'm just saying we have come further than any time before and it is pretty good stuff. So, I don't want to sound like a bear. I'm actually rather a bull on it. But I'm saying, if it doesn't measure up, and it goes to Jim's point, if it doesn't measure up, the United States will stick to its guns, believe me on that.\n\nDAVID FABER: Larry, Carl mentioned the budget deficit. You were on this with us last Friday, I didn't mention it, I like to get to it every other Kudlow appearance. 310 billion for first four months of the year, you know, running close to that trillion dollar number in an economy that is strong, to your point, which makes people wonder: what is going to happen if the economy weakens in terms of our ability to deal with that kind of a deficit if we're generating that much now?\n\nLARRY KUDLOW: Alright, David, did you say in an economy that is soft?\n\nDAVID FABER: No, I said strong.\n\nLARRY KUDLOW: Oh. Thank you. No, no, thank you. I appreciate that. Little ear trouble. Look ay, the budget is coming out next week, I believe, OMB will publish its budget. What you'll see is a study glide path towards lower deficits as a share of GDP and the very tough spending outline, 5% spend and reduction, domestic spending across the board, it's just what the doctor ordered. We don't want government spending to interfere with economic growth. So, you'll see a pretty steady downward glide path. On this point, whatever your villain is in the deficits, let me say even the CBO, with which we generally disagree, I'm not breaking news here on my part, but they just published their new numbers. You know, from the point of pretax cut to now, we have had about $7 trillion unexpected increase. $7 trillion over 10 years in terms of GDP. And that kind of calculates to roughly 1.2, 1.3 trillion in additional revenue. That's the CBO numbers. These are all ten-year estimates, I apologize for that, but that's the convention. So, what am I saying here? The tax cut was about 1.5 trillion scored. We have virtually paid for it, I guess 8 0% paid for it. And that's by the CBO's own numbers. So, our growth estimates as you can expect will be faster, they're closer to 2, we're sticking with 3. I think what we did was, we borrowed in the short run to make a great investment in the economy through tax cuts. That investment is paying off. Growth, productivity, higher wages. And now we will recoup that investment and the books are going to gradually look better and better as the share of GDP. That's the way this thing should work. And I think that's the way it is already working.\n\nCARL QUINTANILLA: Larry, Chinese Foreign Minister appeared to applaud Huawei for filing their suit, should investors see Huawei as a wild card in trade talks?\n\nLARRY KUDLOW: I don't want to get into any details on that one for sure. The Huawei issue is a complicated issue. It is really not a trade issue. I mean, if you listen to Ambassador Lighthizer, we regard that more as a legal issue, at least at the moment. I know it is part of the overall landscape, Carl, but I don't want to really comment on that. There is a legal process that is going on. It may enter into trade. I don't want to make any predictions. Let me just set Huawei aside for the moment.\n\nCARL QUINTANILLA: Okay. Larry, appreciate the time as always.\n\nLARRY KUDLOW: Thank you.\n\nFor more information contact:\n\nJennifer Dauble\n\nCNBC\n\nt: 201.735.4721\n\nm: 201.615.2787\n\ne: jennifer.dauble@nbcuni.com\n\nEmma Martin\n\nCNBC\n\nt: 201.735.4713\n\nm: 551.275.6221\n\ne: emma.martin@nbcuni.com",

    "title": "This Coal Plant Shutdown Shows We Can\u2019t Ignore Communities Left Behind",
    "description": "The end of coal has huge environmental benefits, but the upcoming closure of the Navajo Generating Station shows coal communities need much more support.",
    "text": "LECHEE, Ariz. \u2014 A frosted sheet cake sits on a conference room table, part of a goodbye ceremony that has become a frequent tradition at the Navajo Generating Station, a hulking hilltop coal plant that dominates the northwestern corner of the Navajo reservation, just outside the small town of Page. The steam pumping from its three stacks is visible from at least 40 miles away on a cold day.\n\n\u201cIt is tough to leave,\u201d operations manager Ed Irvin told about three dozen employees gathered in the room to wave him off. He opened a gift from his colleagues \u2014 a Navajo blanket. Like hundreds of his co-workers who have taken jobs at other power plants operated by the same utility, Irvin will transfer to a gas-powered plant in Gila Bend, southwest of Phoenix and about 330 miles south of LeChee. \u201cIf you want to come see me, go to Hell and turn left, because that\u2019s Gila Bend in the summertime,\u201d Irvin joked.\n\nMany northern Arizona residents haven\u2019t felt much like joking as they consider the loss of a power plant that has employed generations of families. The station, which the operator says can power about 1 million homes, first started pumping electricity to Los Angeles and other southwestern cities in 1974 and was supposed to last until 2044. But the owners announced in 2017 that they would abandon the plant by the end of 2019.\n\nMatt Krupnick Operations manager Ed Irvin at his leaving party. He is transferring from Navajo Generating plant to another power plant more than 300 miles away.\n\nCoal power is too expensive to justify, according to Salt River Project, the primary utility company that runs the plant. And with more Americans opposing coal power, according to University of Michigan researchers, the country\u2019s growing opposition to coal has helped push many providers toward renewables and natural gas. Despite the gutting of federal emissions legislation in an effort to boost the industry, coal has failed to bounce back. More than 70 coal plants across the United States are expected to close by the end of 2020.\n\nThe decline of the most-polluting fossil fuel has enormous environmental benefits, not just in terms of reducing emissions but also reducing the air and water pollution that affects communities near coal power plants. According to an analysis published Monday, 90 percent of coal plants that collect data on pollution have contaminated nearby groundwater.\n\nBut a decision that makes economic and environmental sense for many could devastate the way of life for those who live on the Navajo and Hopi reservations and depend heavily on the Navajo Generating Station and the Kayenta coal mine, around 90 miles away, that supplies it. The mine, which straddles the border between the Hopi and Navajo reservations, also will close this year.\n\nThe job losses will be significant. In addition to the more than 500 jobs lost at the station if it closes, more than 300 mine workers will lose their jobs in October. Through lease payments and other revenue, the plant and mine provide a staggering 85 percent of the Hopi tribe\u2019s budget and nearly a quarter of the Navajo\u2019s, say the plant\u2019s supporters.\n\nLike other parts of the U.S. that have been forcefully weaned off coal, northern Arizona is facing a difficult examination of its economy and workforce. As coal continues to decline, it\u2019s a paradox many communities across the U.S. will face: how to ensure positive environmental change doesn\u2019t come at a crippling economic cost for some of America\u2019s most marginalized communities.\n\nMatt Krupnick Pools adjacent to the Navajo Generating Station in northern Arizona.\n\nUnemployment on the sprawling, 17.5 million-acre Navajo reservation ranges between 45 and 55 percent, according to tribal spokesman Jared Touchin, even with the plant open, and some parts of the Navajo Nation still have no electricity or running water. The loss of the plant\u2019s revenue likely would force budget cuts on both the Navajo and Hopi reservations, leading to cuts in services.\n\nIn the case of the Navajo Generating Station, both support and funding for a smooth transition from coal have been lacking, leaving local communities scrambling for an answer.\n\nThe region\u2019s political and educational leaders, who said they were taken by surprise when Salt River Project said it would shut down the plant in 2019, have tried to scrape together contingency plans, but meager funding from taxes and grants has prevented them from figuring out how to replace the jobs and revenue from the coal industry. Several community leaders complained that Salt River Project has provided little help to the region that depended on it for decades.\n\nTwo private companies interested in buying the Navajo Generating Station pulled out last year, saying the challenges were too great. Now, in a desperate, long-shot bid, the tribe is pinning its hopes on purchasing both coal facilities itself, through the Navajo-owned firm, The Navajo Transitional Energy Company, in order to save jobs.\n\nBut the concern is that the tribe would not only saddle itself with a risky, money-losing asset with just 25 years left on its expected lifespan, but that it also might find itself responsible for the clean-up costs when the facilities are eventually retired. And some in the tribe, such as the Navajo environmental group T\u00f3 Nizh\u00f3n\u00ed \u00c1n\u00ed, have come out strongly against the bid.\n\n\u201cAny discussions that hint at a future for NGS beyond 2019 are not based in any credible economic reality,\u201d T\u00f3 Nizh\u00f3n\u00ed \u00c1n\u00ed leader Nicole Horseherder testified last year in front of the House Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources. \u201cThey are an incredibly wasteful distraction to helping the Navajo build a better future.\u201d The closure of the plant and mine would give the Navajo Nation a rare chance to wean itself off coal, she added, and solve long-standing health and environmental problems caused by it.\n\nBut bid leaders are confident taking over the two sites is the way forward, even if Salt River Project said last week its negotiations had stalled because the Navajo bidders were unable to provide enough financial backing.\n\n\u201cWe are going to be the new owners,\u201d said Steve Grey, director of governmental and external affairs for the Navajo Transitional Energy Company. The bidders say it would help the tribe survive until it figures out the next step. The tribe needs to take care of itself, Grey said. \u201cThe Navajo people are very self-sufficient.\u201d\n\nThe problem is people are already leaving. Hundreds of station workers, many with young spouses and children who filled Page-area jobs and schools, have already moved south to other Salt River Project plants, making it even more difficult for the region to recover.\n\nJerry Williams was among the plant employees who took up offers to work in the Phoenix area. He is president of the LeChee chapter of the Navajo Nation and lives just south of Page and in view of the power plant. Williams worked at the Navajo Generating Station for more than 37 years before moving to the Gila Bend gas plant last year; he sleeps most nights on his son\u2019s couch an hour from the plant and then flies back to Page each weekend for chapter meetings and to spend time with his wife.\n\nWilliams, who turns 59 in April, recalled the job interview when the company was considering him for the Gila Bend position. \u201cThey asked me where I want to be in five years. I said, \u2018Back in Page.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe supports the Navajo bid, saying that if the plant closes, there is no good alternative for the Navajo Nation or Page. \u201cI wish I could see Intel coming in, Microsoft coming in, but that\u2019s wishful thinking.\u201d\n\nMatt Krupnick Coconino County Supervisor Lena Fowler in her Flagstaff, Arizona, office. She grew up on the Navajo reservation and is pushing the northern Arizona region to train workers for a post-coal future.\n\nWith a depleted workforce and few prospects to fill the economic void, the region needs to quickly find some way to make up for the losses. In Coconino County, which contains Page and LeChee, officials estimate the region as a whole would lose nearly $7 million a year in taxes associated with the plant, said Lena Fowler, a county supervisor who grew up on the Navajo reservation. She is pushing the northern Arizona region to train workers for a post-coal future.\n\nSeveral community and tribal colleges and Flagstaff-based Northern Arizona University have teamed up to collaborate on vocational programs that would train displaced workers in other professions, but the disciplines being discussed \u2014 culinary arts, apartment maintenance, boat mechanics \u2014 tend not to pay nearly as well as the coal jobs. Power plant operators make nearly $80,000 a year on average, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, compared to about $50,000 for chefs and $41,000 for boat mechanics.\n\nAnd the schools just don\u2019t have the money to train workers in more lucrative professions anyway: Coconino County voters in November voted down a tax measure that would have funded more programs at the local community college.\n\nThe region is seeking help to work out how to diversify its economy. A March symposium organized by Coconino County will bring in leaders of former coal regions and economists to help the region understand how to move past coal, with most of the program focusing on tourism.\n\nIts spectacular landscapes \u2014 beguiling slot canyons, mesas and Lake Powell \u2014 attract busloads and boatloads of tourists in the summer, but winter months are spare. County leaders are looking to extend the tourist season, such as asking the federal government to keep the nearby Grand Canyon open longer in the winter.\n\nLeft_Coast_Photographer via Getty Images The glowing walls of the Antelope Slot Canyon, Page, Arizona.\n\nAnd then there is the region\u2019s renewables potential. Horseherder told the House subcommittee that the tribe needs to prepare now for a future free of fossil fuels. \u201cWe have no choice but to embrace the renewable technology available and move forward with it,\u201d she testified. \u201cThe Navajo Nation must work toward a plan to transition retired coal plants and brownfields into solar and wind generation facilities.\u201d\n\nBut progress toward this is slow. Business and tribal leaders have looked into establishing a big solar plant in the region, but they say it would only employ a fraction of the workforce employed by the Navajo Generation Station.\n\nLeaders of both tribes did not respond to numerous interview requests. Peabody Energy, which owns the Kayenta mine, declined to answer questions.\n\nIt might take outside help for the region to thrive after the closure, but other regions have found that help. In Spain, for instance, a nationwide move away from coal came with social and financial help for those affected, including retraining workers in cleaner energy sources.\n\nLocal business leaders, meanwhile, are rooting for the Navajo group to buy the plant for the economic benefits, but they\u2019re also committed to finding other, still unknown ways to keep the Page area running.\n\n\u201cIf NGS closes, it will be a sad day for all of us, but we are a strong town,\u201d said Judy Franz, executive director of the local chamber of commerce. \u201cWe\u2019ll be OK.\u201d\n\nThe story has been updated to reflect news that the Navajo bid to buy the Navajo Generating Station stalled.\n\nFor more content and to be part of the \u2018This New World\u2019 community, follow our Facebook page.\n\n\n\nHuffPost\u2019s \u2018This New World\u2019 series is funded by Partners for a New Economy and the Kendeda Fund.

    "title": "Stocks on pace to notch best quarter in a decade after rebound. Can they surge higher?",
    "description": "Stock market is poised for its best quarter in a decade and best first quarter since 1998. But after rebound, can it surge higher or has it peaked?",
    "text": "CLOSE Strong holiday sales and oil prices helped boost the stock market following a rout two days earlier. Wochit\n\nThe stock market averted disaster in the first quarter after a historically brutal close to 2018.\n\nBut can it surge higher? Or with minefields lurking, is a recovery from the depths the best investors can hope for?\n\nMany analysts say the market can reach new highs by year-end, though gains will likely moderate amid a slowdown in economic growth and corporate earnings.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough to get significant upside from here,\u201d says Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist for LPL Financial. He added, though, that he expects solid increases that still make the market a good place for investors to put their money.\n\nThe Standard & Poor\u2019s 500 index rose 13 percent the first three months of the year, its best quarterly showing in a decade and the strongest first quarter since 1998, according to LPL Financial and FactSet. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 11.1 percent. And the tech heavy Nasdaq climbed 16.4 percent.\n\n(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nThere\u2019s a caveat, of course. The S&P 500 tumbled 13.9 percent in the fourth quarter and 6.3 percent in 2018, its worst annual performance since the 2008 financial crisis. So while the first-quarter advances prompted a sigh of relief, they still left the broad stock index 3.3 percent below its Sept. 20 peak.\n\nPut another way, both the late 2018 plunge and the first-quarter surge were fueled by the Federal Reserve. In December, the Fed raised interest rates and said it planned two more hikes in 2019 despite the global economic slowdown, spurring a further sell-off in already jittery markets.\n\nThe market turbulence hammered consumer and business confidence, prompting the Fed to abruptly reverse course and forecast no hikes this year.

The 3.8 percent unemployment rate is near a 50-year low, job openings are near record high and a robust average of 223,000 jobs were added last year. In February, employers added just 20,000 jobs, though weather effects were a big factor.\n\nAverage job gains are expected to slow to about 165,000 this year as low unemployment makes it even tougher for employers to find workers. But that\u2019s expected to further push up average annual wage growth that has topped 3 percent since the second half of last year.\n\nBuyer beware: Company convinces Arizona couple, nearly 90, to buy $150,000 timeshare\n\nAll told, more Americans are working and their pay is rising, trends that should support higher consumer spending. And consumption makes up the bulk of economic activity and corporate earnings.\n\nAfter a first quarter that was weakened by the partial government shutdown, the economy is expected to grow 2 percent to 2.5 percent this year as the effects of federal tax cuts and spending increases fade. That's down from about 3 percent in 2018 but still a solid pace.\n\nA U.S.-China trade deal\n\nThe trade fight between the two countries has imposed tariffs that make imports more expensive for U.S. automakers and other manufacturers, narrowing corporate earnings, while hurting exports, especially for farmers. The skirmish has left a cloud of uncertainty over the economy and corporate profits.\n\nWhite House officials have said they\u2019re getting closer to an agreement that would lift the tariffs. Some analysts are wary, noting a deal could be contingent on China agreeing not to steal U.S. intellectual property and other conditions, leaving lingering uncertainty.\n\nYet Perkin says any deal will be better than the status quo.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re going to see a big market pop\u201d when an agreement is reached, he says.\n\nA pact also could provide a jolt to business confidence and investment.\n\nStocks are still only game in town\n\nWith 10-year Treasury bonds yielding a meager 2.4 percent, stocks are still the most promising investment, a dynamic that tends to drive more money to equities and fuel further gains.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll take the equity risk all day long,\u201d Perkin says.\n\nNo irrational exuberance\n\nThe big market drop likely cleansed the market of short-term investors bent on making a quick buck and left more long-term investors focused on company fundamentals.\n\n\u201cIt let a lot of the air out of the tires,\u201d Perkin says.\n\nHere are some warning signs for the market:\n\nSlowing corporate earnings growth\n\nProfits of S&P 500 companies are projected to drop 3.7 percent in the first quarter compared to a year ago, according to FactSet. That\u2019s largely because profits last year were inflated by the federal tax cut. And higher employee wages could further pressure profit margins.\n\nFor all of 2019, corporate earnings are expected to grow 4 percent, revised down from about 10 percent three months ago. Still, that\u2019s close to the historical average, LPL says, and should support continued moderate stock gains. LPL predicts a 6 percent advance in earnings.\n\nThe dreaded yield curve inversion\n\nRecently, yields on 10-year Treasuries dipped below three- month Treasuries. That\u2019s traditionally an ominous sign that means investors don\u2019t have much confidence in growth over the long-term. Each of the past nine recessions dating to the 1950s have been preceded by yield curve inversion.\n\nYet not all inverted yield curves lead to a recession in the near term. And the average gap before a recession occurs is close to two years. Stocks have plenty of room for growth until then, Detrick says.\n\nSlowing global economy\n\nThe global economy is sputtering, particularly China and Europe. S&P 500 companies draw about 40 percent of their revenue from sales overseas. Meanwhile, a British withdrawal from the European Union that doesn\u2019t include a trade deal \u2013 a scenario that seems increasingly likely \u2013 could further roil stocks.\n\nDebt ceiling showdown?\n\nA prolonged battle in Congress this summer over raising the nation\u2019s debt ceiling, or borrowing authority, could dampen the economy and markets. The standoff that led to the 35-day government shutdown earlier this year was not an encouraging sign.\n\nStocks are no longer a bargain\n\nStocks offered a great deal after the big drop at the end of last year. Now, though, the average S&P 500 stock is priced at nearly 17 times projected earnings over the next 12 months. That\u2019s down from a multiple of 18 in late 2017 but above the historical average.\n\nMore: Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan steps down; search underway for bank's next CEO and president\n\nBottom line: LPL projects the S&P 500 will reach a record 3,000 by the end of the year, meaning an additional 6 percent gain is in the offing. That\u2019s a decent return, though not much different from a diversified bond portfolio, according to LPL.\n\nPerkin believes stocks can do a bit better, with up to an 8 percent additional surge as the economy and corporate profits rise more than expected.\n\nCLOSE President Donald Trump will be heading into his second meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong Un Monday expecting \"a very tremendous summit. Trump expects a signing summit on a trade deal to be held soon with China. (Feb. 25) AP\n\nCLOSE A U.S.-China trade agreement is far from being completed and will require much more work, particularly on enforcement, the U.S. official negotiating the pact told a House panel.

    "description": "Generation Z has a few concerns about US President Donald Trump. Business Insider surveyed over 1,800 Americans between the age of 13 and 21 to find out what they think is the biggest issue facing the United States. A total 295 out of 1,559 respondents said t\u2026",
    "text": "Editor's note: Business Insider surveyed 1,884 young Americans about their buying attitudes and beliefs. This is part of a series of stories that will be rolled out over the next several weeks.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. tried to woo the youth during a rally in February, encouraging young conservatives not to let themselves \"be indoctrinated by these loser teachers that are trying to sell you on socialism from birth.\"\n\nBut, according to Business Insider's recent survey of 1,884 young people, much of Generation Z isn't having it. In fact, many of the respondents listed US President Donald Trump when asked to identify \"the most important issue facing the country right now.\"\n\nParticipants in the survey were all Americans between the age of 13 and 21. The national poll was conducted with SurveyMonkey Audience partner Cint on behalf of Business Insider. It ran from January 11 through January 14. Out of those participants, 1,559 young people answered the question about the biggest issue facing the country, while 325 opted to skip it.\n\nAll in all, a total of 295 young people indicated that Trump was the biggest problem facing the nation. That's just over 18% of the individuals who answered the write-in question, but it was by far the most popular response.\n\nRead more: These are the brands that Gen Z shops at most, according to a survey of more than 1,800 young Americans\n\nEven the second and third most popular answers were closely connected to the president's actions. The runner-up response was \"the government shutdown,\" which proved to be the most important issue for 183 respondents. And issues surrounding Trump's proposed border wall were significant for 123 young people.\n\nWhat's more, many of the participants were scathing in their comments about Trump.\n\n\"Trump thinks he can do whatever he wants and doesn't care about who he hurts,\" one young person wrote in their response.\n\nAnother respondent accused Trump of being \"a selfish president who blackmails the country in order to get his way.\"\n\nOther adjectives bandied about were \"stupid,\" \"disgusting, and \"incompetent,\" while a different person accused Trump of \"caging up literal children.\"\n\nBut the responses included a few pro-Trump outliers. Out of the 295 responses mentioning Trump or \"the president\" more generally, two appeared to take more of an issue with Trump's detractors.\n\nOne participant wrote that \"people not supporting the president\" was the biggest issue in the US today, while another agreed that the fact that \"people don't like our president\" was a significant problem.\n\nThe results of the survey aren't exactly surprising, considering Trump's relative unpopularity with young people. In January 2019, the Pew Research Center found that only 30% of Generation Z approves of the president's performance, significantly lower than his overall approval rating.\n\nOf course, Trump does have some support among younger generations, as evidenced by the thousands of young attendees at the pro-Trump Turning Point USA's Student Action Summit this year.\n\nBut, on whole, the numbers might give pause to politicians of the Trumpian strain as Generation Z continues to reach the voting age.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article said that 5% of respondents listed Trump as the biggest issue facing the US.",

    "description": "The Mueller report won't be the beginning of the end of the probe into President Donald Trump. It will be the end of the beginning of the impeachment process.",
    "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nMarch 7, 2019, 10:00 AM GMT By Jonathan Allen\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 This city is waiting with bated breath for special counsel Robert Mueller's report on his investigation into the Trump operation's ties to Russia and possible obstruction of justice by the president and his allies, which is widely expected to land soon.\n\nBut even without those findings in hand, House Democrats effectively launched the impeachment process this week.\n\nRep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, demanded a ream of documents from Trumpworld; Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, beefed up his staff; and Rep. Bill Pascrell, D-N.J., a member of the Ways and Means Committee, told NBC his panel would likely ask for Trump's tax records in the next \"two, three weeks.\"\n\nThe Mueller report won't be the beginning of the end of the investigation into Trump. Instead, it will be the end of the beginning of a political and legal nightmare that promises to subsume an ever greater portion of his presidency and could, conceivably, lead to his impeachment.\n\nFor Trump and his Republican supporters in Congress, the latest moves by Democrats in Congress \u2014 which come alongside a New York state investigation into his company's insurance records, the latest in a long list of state probes of his finances \u2014 amount to a partisan push to overturn the results of the 2016 election that could backfire on his adversaries.\n\n\"Their intention is impeachment regardless of the facts, and it should be the opposite way,\" said Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., the Republican whip in the House. \"I think the American people are tired of that kind of harassment of the president.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Sarah Sanders dismissed Nadler's new probe as a \"fishing expedition\" \u2014 \"a disgraceful and abusive investigation.\"\n\nDemocratic leaders are trying to carefully shepherd a two-step process that begins with investigations which might or might not lead to impeachment.\n\nEarlier this week, Nadler, Schiff and House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings, D-Md., wrote letters to White House officials explaining that they were expanding their inquiry into the possible destruction of documents relating to Trump's private meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin because the administration had not responded to a request to turn over relevant records.\n\nThe lines of investigation run from Trump's campaign and White House operations all the way to his tax records and business dealings, and some Democrats are convinced they will ultimately be able to use their findings to tell the story of a president who has committed offenses for which he should be removed from office.\n\nBut there's tremendous friction within their own party over this methodical approach. Some lawmakers, like freshman Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., have already grown impatient with the pace of the process.\n\nTlaib said Wednesday that she would introduce a resolution this month calling on the Judiciary Committee to formally begin impeachment proceedings. Earlier this year, she grabbed headlines when she was caught on camera telling supporters Democrats would \"impeach the motherf---er.\"\n\nBut many House Democrats aren't ready to vote to impeach the president. Some don't believe they've seen enough evidence of \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" \u2014 the Constitution's standard for impeachable offenses \u2014 while others say it's a fool's errand for the House to pass articles if there aren't 20 Republican senators ready to help create the two-thirds majority needed to remove Trump from office.\n\nThe tension within the caucus is palpable, especially as a crop of newcomers who won in heavily Democratic seats push to take action, while those who helped create the new Democratic majority by winning Republican-held territory are generally more circumspect.\n\nRep. Anthony Brindisi, a Blue Dog Democrat from upstate New York who is representative of the latter group, said there's been a noticeable ramping up of impeachment talk on Capitol Hill in recent days.\n\n\"It sure feels like it,\" he said in an interview Wednesday morning. That concerns him because \"it could sidetrack us\" from demonstrating to voters that Democrats can move forward with a policy agenda.\n\n\"I'm not for impeachment,\" he said. \"It's going to be a high bar.\"\n\nThe investigation piece must be a predicate for impeachment, said Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., who attributed the seemingly sudden shift in urgency to the power Democrats now have in the House. Earlier in the year, they were focused mostly on a fight with Trump over a partial government shutdown and the question of whether Congress would fund his border wall.\n\nNow, though, with the government re-opened and the wall brawl in the hands of federal courts, committee chairmen are starting to get down to investigative business.\n\n\"All questions about the Trump White House have been bottled up for two years,\" he said. \"This is an accumulation.\"\n\nTrump sees a sprawling \"witch hunt\" designed to bring him down at any cost.\n\n\"Now that they realize the only Collusion with Russia was done by Crooked Hillary Clinton & the Democrats, Nadler, Schiff and the Dem heads of the Committees have gone stone cold CRAZY,\" he wrote on Twitter Tuesday. \"81 letter[s] sent to innocent people to harass them. They won\u2019t get ANYTHING done for our Country!\"\n\nWhile it's clear the House has now jumped headlong into what could be a lengthy process for investigating and possibly impeaching the president, senior Democratic lawmakers are still trying to play down the extent to which they are turning up the heat.\n\n\"We're just doing our regular oversight,\" said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif.\n\nBut with Mueller's report widely expected to drop shortly, they are also preparing to take up the investigative baton.",

What you\u2019ve just shown is commercial satellite imagery to be sure. The United States government -- I\u2019ll just put it this way -- expands a lot of resources and efforts so we don't have to rely on commercial satellite imagery. We\u2019ve seen a lot in North Korea. We watch it constantly.\u201d\n\nRADDATZ: \u201cAnd what would the consequences be if we saw another test launch?\u201d BOLTON: \u201cWell as the president said, he\u2019d be pretty disappointed if Kim Jong Un went ahead and did something like that.

    "title": "Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s misleading complaint: Trump did not transfer funds for the opioid emergency",
    "description": "Rep. Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) misleadingly compares Trump's action on border-wall funding with the response to the opioid health-care emergency.",
    "text": "\u201cAmount President Trump has transferred from other agencies to fund his \u2018Build the Wall\u2019 Emergency: $10s of millions, & has identified billions more. Amount he\u2019s transferred to address the Opioid National Emergency: $0\u201d\n\n\u2014 Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), in a tweet over a C-SPAN tweet, March 8\n\nC-SPAN tweeted out a five-minute clip of Ocasio-Cortez questioning James W. Carroll, the White House\u2019s director of drug policy, with this quote highlighted: \u201c@AOC compares #OpioidCrisis to #SouthernBorder: \u2018So, we\u2019ve got two emergencies, one is treated with an actual action and the other is just to raise awareness.\u2019 \"\n\nOcasio-Cortez then retweeted it with the comment above, earning nearly 50,000 retweets and likes.\n\nIn her questioning, Ocasio-Cortez focused especially on the Public Health Emergency Fund \u2014 according to the Government Accountability Office, the fund has just $57,000 in it \u2014 and whether the declaration of a public health crisis regarding opioids should have triggered a transfer of money from other agencies, a la Trump\u2019s maneuvers to build a wall.\n\n\u201cDid the declaration of a public health emergency for opioids make any additional funding available to expand treatment for individuals for overdose to provide services for people in recovery?\u201d she asked.\n\nBut Ocasio-Cortez is making a highly misleading comparison. Here\u2019s what\u2019s going on.\n\nThe Facts\n\nEarlier this year, Trump demanded $5.7 billion to fund his proposed border wall. Congress refused to do so, even after Trump engineered a lengthy government shutdown. So he declared a national emergency and said he would transfer funds from other agency accounts. Ultimately, the courts will sort out whether he has the power to override the congressional control of the purse.\n\nIn the case of the opioid crisis, Trump in August 2017 acted on the recommendations of a task force on the crisis and \u201cinstructed his administration to use all appropriate emergency and other authorities to respond to the crisis caused by the opioid epidemic,\u201d the White House said. In October 2017, acting health and human services secretary Eric D. Hargan said that, at Trump\u2019s instruction, he had declared a \u201cnationwide public health emergency.\u201d The declaration has been renewed five times.\n\nSuch declarations allow the HHS secretary to take a variety of steps, including using money appropriated for the Public Health Emergency Fund.\n\nAfter the declaration, Congress appropriated more than $6 billion to combat the opioid crisis, including $4.4 billion in the fiscal 2019 spending bill. The bill included $1.5 billion in state response grants, $500 million for research, $475.6 million for prescription drug overdose prevention, $120 million for rural communities and $89 million for medication-assisted treatment for addiction; it also gave the director of the National Institutes of Health the ability to transfer funds \u201cspecifically appropriated for opioid addiction, opioid alternatives, pain management, and addiction treatment.\u201d\n\nCongress also moved other legislation, including passage in late 2018 of the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment (SUPPORT) for Patients and Communities Act, a legislative vehicle for dozens of bills to address the epidemic. The final appropriations bill that Trump signed in February, which included Justice Department funding, also included $77 million for drug courts to support nonviolent offenders in recovery, $22 million for men and women in uniform suffering from addiction and $87.5 million for offender reentry and research activities.\n\nIn other words, the situations are not comparable. Trump wanted almost $6 billion for his wall, which Congress refused. But Congress acted to give the administration more than $6 billion for the opioid crisis, so there was little need for him to transfer funds without congressional authorization.\n\nOcasio-Cortez asked whether there was additional funding for overdose victims and people seeking recovery \u2014 and the answer is yes.\n\nIn a red herring, at the hearing Ocasio-Cortez focused on the fact that there was only $57,000 in the Public Health Emergency Fund. This is a relic from 1983 that has rarely been used.\n\n\u201cBetween 1988 and 2000, the fund was authorized for annual appropriations sufficient to have a balance of $45 million at the beginning of each fiscal year,\u201d said a report by the Congressional Research Service. \u201cDespite this prior authorization of annual appropriations, the fund received appropriations only in response to a few public health threats (e.g., the emergence of hantavirus in the Southwest in 1993-1994), but did not receive an appropriation for its intended use as a reserve fund for unanticipated events.\u201d\n\nIn the GAO report, HHS explained that it was not necessary to tap this fund to deal with the opioid crisis. \u201cDepartment of Health and Human Services (HHS) officials determined that other authorities could be used, rather than public health emergency authorities,\u201d the report said. \u201cHHS also provided evidence that the Public Health Emergency Fund currently contains approximately $57,000.\u201d It was last used more than a quarter-century ago.\n\nConfusing matters, there is another entity called the Public Health and Social Services Emergency Fund, which was appropriated with more than $2 billion in fiscal 2019. This fund is intended to respond to the health and medical consequences of all public health emergencies, including bioterrorism, but only a small part appears to be dedicated to the opioid crisis, mainly to provide funding to civilian volunteer medical reserve corps that help combat the crisis.\n\nOcasio-Cortez\u2019s staff did not respond to The Fact Checker\u2019s queries.\n\nUpdate, March 14: Two days after this fact check appeared, we received a statement from her staff, which read in part:\n\n\u201cAlthough President Trump has characterized both the opioid epidemic and the Southern border as national emergencies, he has treated them very differently. When President Trump declared the opioid epidemic a public health emergency in October 2017, he did not dedicate any new funding to address the epidemic, nor was any new funding provided by Congress until months after the declaration. ...\u00b7 In contrast, President Trump has declared a national emergency at the border, even though he has publicly stated that there is no sense of urgency. President Trump has proposed transferring billions of dollars from other federal agencies and departments to fund the construction of a border wall.\u201d\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nOcasio-Cortez is making a misleading comparison. Trump has no need to transfer billions of dollars for the opioid emergency because Congress has appropriated billions of dollars. Trump\u2019s backing of a national public-health emergency did more than raise awareness; it triggered a congressional response. So it\u2019s the exact opposite of the standoff over the wall.\n\nOne can question the effectiveness of the Trump response to the opioid epidemic without resorting to red herrings and false equivalency. Only in the most narrow technical way is her statement correct, so we cannot quite consider this a Four-Pinocchio claim. So Ocasio-Cortez earns three.\n\nThree Pinocchios\n\n(About our rating scale)\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\n\nThe Fact Checker is a verified signatory to the International Fact-Checking Network code of principles",

NIELSEN was in London for meetings, and inside the White House, there was discussion all day Monday of bringing her back to the United States. This plane landed at DCA at 11:36 p.m. Nielsen came back to Washington for this.\n\nSCOOP \u2026 HOUSE MINORITY LEADER KEVIN MCCARTHY (R-CALIF.) raised $23.06 MILLION in the first quarter of 2019, an extremely large haul believed to be the biggest ever of any House Republican leader -- including speaker of the House.

On Sunday, The New York Times reported that some Democrats are bracing \u2018for an extended reckoning about Mr. Biden and gender if he enters the race.\u2019 The inevitably of such a reckoning should make Biden reconsider getting in.\u201d NYT\n\nJOE, WHERE ARE YOU? \u2026 AT THE MOMENT, JOE BIDEN is an expert at creating vacuums. He\u2019s decided to take his time getting into the race, which has created a vacuum in the field, and has allowed other candidates like PETE BUTTIGIEG to rise.\n\nALSO \u2026 His team has not made Biden available for a single interview, allowing others to tell his story. This isn\u2019t 2009. On-the-record statements don\u2019t suffice. A lot of folks are wondering why Biden won\u2019t address this head-on. Biden team\u2019s rebuttal\n\nGood Tuesday morning.

POLITICO is more than 12 years old, and the news organization clicks without any of its founders immersed in daily management -- and that\u2019s a huge accomplishment. Revenue is up 50 percent, and the company is cooking with grease, on both the journalistic and business fronts.\n\n-- THE LONG ARC \u2026 FIRST, Harris helped create POLITICO, changing Washington journalism forever. He then took a central role in launching POLITICO Europe, which shook up the Brussels press corps. He steered the company through tricky times, installing us atop of the Playbook franchise, shaping our coverage in the states and leading the transition into our second decade. Harris is leaving daily management but not POLITICO leadership; Allbritton has invited him on to the publication\u2019s corporate board.\n\nHARRIS SAID HE PLEDGED TO Allbritton that he would not step down until he completed his last big assignment as editor-in-chief: giving Allbritton a team of successors in which he could place full confidence. In global editor Matt Kaminski and POLITICO\u2019s editor Carrie Budoff Brown -- the same team that was paired for the creation of POLITICO Europe in Brussels -- he has done that. We expect to hear from Allbritton later this morning.\n\nSINCE YOU ARE A REGULAR PLAYBOOK READER, you know that we love when Harris writes -- which he tells us he will be doing much more of now. This is great news for POLITICO and its readers.\n\nA message from American Bankers Association: April is Financial Literacy Month.

    "description": "If you're hunting for a house this spring, say goodbye to bidding wars. And if you're selling, get ready for good, old-fashioned negotiations.",
    "text": "CLOSE Millennials move in with mom and dad to save for a new home. USA Today\n\nIf you're hunting for a house this spring, say goodbye to frenzied bidding wars. And if you're selling, get ready for good, old-fashioned negotiations.\n\nWhile real estate brokers aren't declaring a buyer's market just yet, demand has definitely cooled since last summer and the upper hand sellers once enjoyed has largely disappeared.\n\nEscalating prices and higher interest rates convinced buyers to step to the sidelines in the fall, slowing the once-runaway market. As 2019's buying season gets underway, several factors are now in the buyer's corner: moderating mortgage rates compared with just months ago and more homes for sale, easing competition.\n\nNationwide, just 13 percent of offers had competing proposals in January, down from 53 percent a year earlier, according to data from Redfin, which has offices in 85 major metro areas.\n\nClose your wallet: The billfold as you know it may be dying\n\nNo job. No problem: Businesses hire high-skilled workers even if there's no position\n\n(Photo: Getty Images)\n\nSome of the steepest drops occurred in markets that were once the hottest in the U.S. In San Francisco, the share of sales drawing multiple offers fell from 82 percent to 18 percent; in Seattle, the share dropped from 69 percent to 15 percent;and in Boston they slid from 53 percent to 14 percent.\n\n\u201cSellers in the areas where we saw the highest appreciation, they can\u2019t expect to see that now,\u201d says Jennifer Johnsen Cameron, a vice president with Coldwell Banker Bain in Bellevue, Washington, outside Seattle. \u201cSellers need to be realistic about pricing. They can no longer name their price.\u201d\n\nWhat changed?\n\nThe shift began in the middle of last year after a hot spring homebuying season, says Daryl Fairweather, Redfin\u2019s chief economist. \u201cBuyers backed off because home prices became unaffordable and interest rates peaked,\u201d she says.\n\nIn June, the median price of a previously owned home hit $276,500, the highest level for the year. Mortgage rates hovered around 4.8 percent, on their way to above 5 percent in October and November \u2013 a seven-year high.\n\nRates have since moderated, giving buyers an extra $100 or in savings per month on a mortgage payment. Rates are expected to stay below 5 percent this year \u2013 thanks to a more patient Federal Reserve, says Lawrence Yun, chief economist of the National Association of Realtors.\n\nThat's a reversal from his earlier forecast in December when he predicted rates could hit 5.5 percent by the end of the year. \"That's not in the picture currently,\u201d he says.\n\nA 'For Sale' sign stands in front of a house, in Walpole, Mass. (Photo: Steven Senne, AP)\n\nThe good and bad of mortgage rates\n\nInterest rates hit Randall Parker as both a seller and a buyer. In late August, he listed his house in the rural outskirts of Nashville, Tennessee. The house sat for 58 days. By the time he closed on it in October, rates had surpassed 5 percent and school was in session.\n\n\u201cI thought the timing was not good on our part,\u201d Parker, a fuel truck driver, says. \u201cWe barely made $10,000 more than what we bought it for.\u201d\n\nBut two months later he scooped up a house in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, from a divorcing couple, and without too much competition. Fewer buyers were in the market, spooked by mortgage rates and worries about a looming government shutdown.\n\n\u201cIt was a perfect storm for him as a buyer,\u201d says Shawn Wright, his agent with C21 Wright Realty outside Nashville. \u201cHe got a great deal.\u201d\n\nNEWSLETTERS Get the Managing Your Money newsletter delivered to your inbox We're sorry, but something went wrong A collection of articles to help you manage your finances like a pro.

More newsletters\n\nFinally, more choices\n\nA build-up of available houses is also helping buyers. For years, many markets suffered from too few homes for sale, especially on the entry-level side. That\u2019s starting to ease \u2013 after seven straight months of year-over-year increases in listings \u2013 though first-time buyers will see the smallest rise in options.\n\nPaul Danis, a small-time homebuilder in the Bellevue area outside Seattle, noticed the market winds had shifted three to four months ago. The last home he sold closed in February 2018 without ever going on the market. A savvy real estate agent toured it while it was still under construction and sent pictures to her buyers who bought it, sight unseen.\n\nHe put another house on the market four months ago. No bites. He dropped the price by 5 percent and it finally just went into contract.\n\n\u201cMy wife is a realtor, so she already knew things were adjusting in the market,\u201d Danis says. \u201cWe knew we would have to chase this one downhill a little bit.\u201d\n\nIn the Seattle metro area, the number of homes on the market in February grew 85 percent year over year, the fourth-biggest increase percentage-wise in the nation, according to data from Realtor.com. Inventory in Denver and San Jose \u2013 No. 1 and 2 in in terms of gains of homes available \u2013 more than doubled.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a buyer, you don\u2019t have to fight as hard,\" Fairweather says. \"You don\u2019t have to worry the house is going to be bid out from under you.\"\n\nTurning tides in Boston\n\nIn Boston, first-time buyers were routinely elbowed out by bidding wars. Now, \"They have a little bit more breathing room,\" says James Major, a broker at Century 21 North East in Woburn and president of the Greater Boston Association of Realtors.\n\nAmanda Gundy and her husband, Jonathan Andrew, made offers for 11 houses in Boston\u2019s northwest suburbs last year, losing out each time despite bidding above asking price. Each drew 15 to 20 competing offers.\n\nInitially, Gundy says, \u201cYou start drawing a painting of your life\u201d when making an offer, imagining where their three-year-old daughter would play.\n\nBut after repeatedly losing, \u201cYou have to detach yourself,\u201d Gundy, 36, says. \u201cIt was tough.\u201d\n\nThe couple, who had been renting a 1.5-bedroom apartment in Belmont, Massachusetts, progressively lowered their standards, giving up demands for two bathrooms or a garage. They would see a house and say, \u201cShould we? Sure -- whatever.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were definitely thinking of giving up and maybe the area just wasn\u2019t working well for us,\u201d Gundy says. \u201cWe were thinking of going to Vermont.\u201d\n\nBut in November, they attended an open house for a three-bedroom ranch on a 1.6 acre wooded parcel in Wakefield, Massachusetts, and realized they were the only ones there. They quickly learned there had been another open house two weeks earlier. In the meantime, the owners lowered the price by $10,000.\n\n\u201cI got super-excited,\u201d she says. They still had to bid $6,000 more than the $449,000 list price. There was only one other rival offer and Gundy and her husband won with a final bid of $465,000.\n\n\u201cIt was just like an instant flood of relief,\u201d Gundy says. \u201cI started entertaining daydreams of running around the yard with our daughter.\u201d\n\nThey closed in December.\n\nBuyer tips\n\nPreviously, many buyers waived contingencies that made sales dependent on home inspections or loan approvals. Some even bought houses sight unseen. Such concessions are now far less common, Fairweather says.\n\nDespite the cooling market, buyers still don\u2019t hold all the cards. To make your offer the most attractive, do more than just get a mortgage preapproval, says Wright.\n\n\u201cThis can make your offer strong and competitive against cash buyers,\u201d Wright says.\n\nAsk your lender to run you through most of the underwriting upfront.\n\nShorten the contingency window and promise a faster home inspection and appraisal.\n\nOffer proof of funds to show the down payment money is in the bank already.\n\nConsider writing a heartfelt \u201clove\u201d letter to the seller, explaining why this house is the one for your family.\n\nSeller advice\n\nSmart pricing is the key this year for sellers.

    "description": "First Read is your briefing from \"Meet the Press\" and the NBC Political Unit on the day's most important political stories and why they matter.",
    "text": "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nMarch 11, 2019, 12:27 PM GMT By Chuck Todd, Mark Murray and Carrie Dann\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Don\u2019t obsess over the 2020 horserace polls right now \u2014 with 329 days before the Iowa caucuses take place, the Democratic presidential race will drastically change over the next year.\n\nInstead, pay attention to what, exactly, Democratic caucus-goers want when it comes to the issues and the characteristics of their candidates, according to the Des Moines Register/CNN poll that was released over the weekend:\n\n83 percent of likely caucus-goers want a candidate who focuses on harnessing Democrats\u2019 positive energy (versus 13 percent who want a candidate who focuses on harnessing Democrats\u2019 anger at President Trump);\n\n81 percent hope candidates will spend a lot of time talking about health care;\n\n80 percent hope candidates will spend a lot of time talking about climate change;\n\n67 percent support a candidate who backs \u2014 in full \u2014 new taxes for those with more than $50 million in assets;\n\n65 percent support a candidate who backs \u2014 in full \u2014 the Green New Deal;\n\n56 percent would be satisfied with a candidate who wants the United States to be more socialist (though just 15 percent say they would be \u201cvery satisfied\u201d with this);\n\n49 percent support a candidate who backs \u2014 in full \u2014 Medicare for All;\n\n44 percent support a candidate who backs \u2014 in full \u2014 the legalization of marijuana nationwide;\n\nand 36 percent support a candidate who backs \u2014 in full \u2014 free tuition for college.\n\nSo this electorate is very positive, very focused on health care and climate change, and very liberal.\n\nBut the liberalism in Iowa also has its limits: 44 percent of likely caucus-goers say Bernie Sanders is too liberal, versus 48 percent who say his political views are about right.\n\nThat\u2019s compared with 23 percent who say Elizabeth Warren is too liberal, and just 14 percent Joe Biden is too conservative.\n\nBorder Battle, Part 43\n\nJust in case you thought President Trump had retreated on the issue that led to the 35-day-old government shutdown\u2026\n\nOn Monday, per NBC News, Trump will ask Congress for an additional $8.6 billion to pay for his border wall.\n\n\u201cThe demand, part of the administration's budget request for fiscal year 2020, is more than six times what Congress allocated for border projects in each of the past two fiscal years and slightly more than Trump has corralled by invoking emergency powers this year.\u201d\n\nBut remember, a president\u2019s budget proposal is simply his administration\u2019s ask \u2013 it\u2019s up to Congress to see if that money is eventually appropriated.\n\nTweet of the day\n\nPrince and Persia\n\nIn an interview with Al Jazeera, Blackwater founder Erik Prince said he discussed Iran policy in an August 2016 Trump Tower meeting \u2014 something he didn\u2019t disclose to the House Intelligence Committee in its investigation of interference into the 2016 election:\n\nPRINCE: We were there to talk about Iran policy.\n\nMEDHI HASAN: You were there to talk about Iran policy?\n\nPRINCE: Uh-huh.\n\nMEDHI HASAN: Don't you think that's something important to disclose to the House Intelligence Committee while you're under oath?\n\nERIK PRINCE: I did.\n\nMEDHI HASAN: You didn't. We just went through the testimony. There's no mention of the Trump Tower meeting August 2016. Why not?\n\nERIK PRINCE: I don't know if they got the transcript wrong.\n\nOn \u201cMeet the Press\u201d yesterday, House Intel Chairman Adam Schiff said Prince isn\u2019t telling the truth about the transcript.\n\n\u201cThere was nothing wrong with the reporter who transcribed his testimony. He did not disclose that meeting to our committee,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cAnd in fact, as you can see from the published transcript of his interview, he was asked what kind of role he played, if any, in the campaign, and he said he had no role apart from on his own submitting written papers, hanging a yard sign, or making a contribution.\u201d\n\nMore Schiff: \u201cSo his \u2026 interview certainly looks inconsistent with his testimony. Bob Mueller has that testimony already. And Bob Mueller will have to make the decision about whether that rises to a level of deliberate falsehood.\u201d\n\n2020 Vision: Buttigieg blasts Pence for cheerleading \u201cthe porn-star presidency\u201d\n\nIn a town hall on CNN last night, 2020 Dem Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., knocked fellow Hoosier Mike Pence when asked who would be a better president, Trump or Pence?\n\n\u201cHow could somebody who , you know, his interpretation of scripture is pretty different from mine to begin with. \u2026 But even if you buy into that, how could he allow himself to become the cheerleader of the porn-star presidency? Is that he stopped believing in scripture when he started believing in Donald Trump? I don't know. I don't know.\u201d\n\nOn the trail today\n\nButtigieg, fresh off that town hall last night, stumps in Portsmouth, N.H.\n\nData Download: The number of the day is \u2026 43 percent and 31 percent.\n\nThose are the shares of likely Iowa Democratic caucus-goers in the new Des Moines Register/CNN poll who say that Bernie Sanders (43 percent) and Joe Biden (31 percent) have seen their \u201ctime pass\u201d and should make room for a new generation of leaders.\n\nA majority \u2014 54 percent \u2014 say that Sanders \u201chas pushed the party in a good direction,\u201d but it\u2019s still noteworthy that nearly four-in-10 express hesitation that he\u2019s in the race at all.\n\nThe poll found more enthusiasm for Biden, with nearly two-thirds of Democratic caucus-goers saying that they want to see Biden in the race.\n\nThe Lid: Who\u2019s afraid of Joe Biden?\n\nDon\u2019t miss our pod from Friday, when one of us looked at how Joe Biden\u2019s anticipated entry in the 2020 race has cleared the Dem field \u2013 and how it hasn\u2019t.\n\nICYMI: Beto\u2019s decision could come soon\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s decision could come as early as this week.\n\nA former aide to Kirsten Gillibrand resigned in protest over the handling of a sexual harassment complaint.\n\nForty percent of registered Republicans in Iowa want a GOP challenger to Trump.\n\nTucker Carlson isn\u2019t apologizing for past comments about women, statutory rape and underage marriage.\n\nThe Supreme Court is going to hear an interesting freedom of speech case involving a four-letter word.\n\nAnd don\u2019t miss today\u2019s other news\u2026.\n\nTrump agenda: Donald and Bibi\n\nTrump\u2019s partnership with Netanhayu is as strong as ever \u2014 but is it coming to an end amid the prime minister\u2019s political woes?\n\nTrump reportedly told RNC donors that \u201cthe Democrats hate Jewish people.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s more on Trump\u2019s budget request for wall money.\n\nAdam Schiff told one of us(!) that it would be a mistake for Robert Mueller not to get in-person testimony from Donald Trump.\n\nDem agenda: What Ilhan Omar\u2019s constituents are saying\n\nRep. Ilhan Omar\u2019s constituents aren\u2019t all as outraged about her comments about Israel as others around the country.\n\nNancy Pelosi is still struggling to unify Democrats after the Omar controversy.\n\nLiz Cheney says that Democrats are \u201cenabling\u201d anti-Semitism.\n\nElijah Cummings is seeking testimony from two more Trump attorneys about the Cohen payments.\n\n2020: Looking at Trump\u2019s operation\n\nThe Washington Post has a deep dive on Trump\u2019s 2020 operation.\n\nDemocrats in Texas this weekend have their eyes on a statewide win in 2020.\n\nMany of Bill de Blasio\u2019s allies are \u2026 not really on board for a 2020 presidential run.\n\nBernie Sanders\u2019 campaign will be based in both DC and Vermont.\n\nDemocratic presidential hopefuls are trying to gain some ground in the country\u2019s rural areas.\n\nTulsi Gabbard won\u2019t say if Assad is a war criminal.\n\nJulian Castro isn\u2019t ruling out direct reparations payments.",

What better way to start your day than with songs (picked by us and readers) about roads, rails, rivers and runways?\n\nAviation\n\nFAA, BOEING IN A BRIGHT SPOTLIGHT: With an ever-growing number of investigations picking up speed, Congress\u2019 focus on the FAA\u2019s certification process for the Boeing 737 MAX will come to a head in a Senate hearing this afternoon. The Senate Commerce hearing, which will feature the heads of the FAA, NTSB and DOT inspector general, comes as top lawmakers in the House are calling for FAA to have an independent third-party review Boeing\u2019s changes to a flight control system linked to two recent crashes \u2014 a sign that trust in the agency, typically regarded as the gold standard for aviation safety, may be wavering on Capitol Hill. Your host and Brianna Gurciullo have the details, plus some of what will be expected to crop up in testimony today, including the fact that the FAA will roll out \u201ca significant change\u201d to its oversight approach in the next few months.\n\nAnother layer: In case that wasn\u2019t all complicated enough, there are also more details emerging about a special committee that DOT created to review the MAX certification. That special committee is within the structure of a broader DOT committee, the Safety Oversight and Certification Advisory Committee, which was congressionally mandated to be created months ago, but which DOT is just setting up now. House Transportation Chairman Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.) slammed that as a \u201crush job\u201d in an interview with your host, and also said he doesn\u2019t think it has the \u201ctrack record or the gravitas\u201d to deal with the MAX certification.\n\nHOW TO FUND AIRPORT UPGRADES? The House Transportation Committee didn\u2019t solve the debate over the Passenger Facility Charge with a hearing on Tuesday, but did lawmakers move it forward a little? Maybe. The general split remains: Democrats (along with a handful of conservatives) and airports want to increase the cap on the fee to fund airport infrastructure improvements, and Republicans and airlines want to keep it where it is. DeFazio said that he\u2019s not opposed to boosting Airport Improvement Grants, which go out to airports in proportion to their passenger volume, but he also thinks the $4.50 cap should be lifted on the PFC.\n\nSome Republicans torn: Beyond the handful of conservatives who support the fee increase because of the \u201cuser pays\u201d principle, and those who oppose it because they see it as a tax increase, other Republicans are ambivalent. Rep. Sam Graves (R-Mo.), the committee\u2019s ranking member, said that reviewing airport infrastructure investments makes sense, given the high volume of travelers, but the committee needs to \u201cmake sure we\u2019re talking about airport needs and not airport wants,\u201d in addition to staying accountable to passengers. Rep. Rodney Davis (R-Ill.) said he thinks there\u2019s a \u201csweet spot\u201d of compromise between airlines and airports\u2019 positions.\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth: \u201cWe don\u2019t come up here just because we think it\u2019s fun. We do actually need the money,\u201d said Joe Lopano, CEO of Tampa International Airport.\n\nIN CONGRESS\n\nSHUTDOWN BILL GETS COMMITTEE VOTE: The House Transportation Committee will mark up a bill, H.R. 1108 (116), by DeFazio that would authorize the FAA to take money from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund during government shutdowns, avoiding a situation like in January, when air traffic controllers went unpaid for more than a month. The committee will also vote on legislation, H.R. 367 (116), to compensate civilian Coast Guard employees that were furloughed during the shutdown and to ensure continuing appropriations to the Coast Guard during any other possible shutdown in 2019, and several other bills including one that would establish a task force to improve Notices to Airmen, H.R. 1775 (116).\n\nSpace\n\nCHAO LAUNCHES NEW COMMERCIAL SPACE RULE: The FAA on Tuesday issued a proposed rule aimed at streamlining federal requirements for commercial trips into space, Pro\u2019s Jacqueline Klimas reports. The rule includes regulations for launch, re-entry and launch site providers, and follows a White House directive last year telling agencies to revise their rules around private spaceflight. The proposed rule \u201cstreamlines the licensing process, enables flexible time-frames, redefines when launch begins and allows the space industry to seek a single license to launch from multiple sites,\" according to Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao.\n\nMaritime\n\nOFFPUTIN\u2019: Russian GPS spoofing affected more than a thousand ships between 2016 and 2018, according to a new report, which was also by covered by Jacqueline Tuesday. The report also found that spoofing \u2014 transmitting false signals in order to confuse receivers \u2014 occurs whenever high-ranking Russian officials like Vladimir Putin are nearby. As Jacqueline writes, \u201cThe findings could prompt U.S. officials to take action to strengthen the nation's GPS security.\u201d It\u2019s an issue that Rep. John Garamendi (D-Calif.) cares about (and a source of frustration) \u2014 spoofing is a violation of international regulations with potentially dangerous consequences for American ships. \"I have been screaming and yelling and jumping up and down about this for seven years,\" Garamendi told Jacqueline.\n\nTHE AUTOBAHN\n\n\u2014 \"$7,500 tax credit for GM's electric cars to be phased out.\" POLITICO Pro.\n\n\u2014 \u201cLufthansa plans to buy either Boeing 737 MAX or Airbus A320neo.\u201d Reuters.\n\n\u2014 \u201cConstruction, business stakeholders renew push for infrastructure bill.\u201d Transport Topics.\n\n\u2014 \u201cAlaska moose-hunter can \u2018rev up\u2019 his hovercraft, court rules.\u201d Associated Press.\n\n\u2014 \u201cCalifornia bill curbing use of contractors would not exempt Uber, Lyft, other tech firms.\u201d Los Angeles Times.\n\n\u2014 \u201cLyft to price shares above targeted range of $62 to $68 in IPO.\u201d Wall Street Journal.\n\nTHE COUNTDOWN\n\nDOT appropriations run out in 187 days.

    "title": "From making history in Congress, Veronica Escobar tackles the border battle",
    "description": "Rep. Veronica Escobar, one of the first two Hispanic women in Congress from Texas, is fighting the administration's immigration policies and push for a border wall.",
    "text": "March 8, 2019, 7:54 PM GMT By Suzanne Gamboa, Phillip Mena and Cora Cervantes\n\nEL PASO, Texas \u2014 When Rep. Veronica Escobar thinks of her hometown, what comes to mind is the more than 100-year-old dairy farm that generations of Escobars have owned and worked.\n\nEscobar, who grew up in this border city on Texas\u2019 westernmost tip, thinks of her father delivering milk even while working as the El Paso County engineer. She thinks of fun nights in high school in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, just a short walk across a bridge spanning the Rio Grande.\n\nAnd she thinks of the many international gateways between the U.S. and Mexico, what she calls \u201carteries\u201d for family, commerce, economy and the future.\n\nWhat Escobar, 49, a Democrat, didn\u2019t see growing up and living in El Paso was a city so teeming with violent crime that it had to be saved by building a border wall \u2014 something President Donald Trump called for in his State of the Union address.\n\n\u201cIt is one of the greatest communities in all of America. The border is such a magical, complex place,\u201d Escobar told MSNBC and NBC News in interviews over two days. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s this place where two worlds are juxtaposed.\"\n\nThose worlds \u2014 El Paso and Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico \u2014 couldn\u2019t be more different, but the ports of entry where pedestrian and vehicle traffic flows both ways are \u201csymbols of unity and togetherness,\u201d she said.\n\nEscobar, a freshman Democrat, made history along with Rep. Sylvia Garcia, also a Democrat, in the 2018 midterm elections by becoming the first two Latinas elected to represent Texas in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n\nSince Escobar arrived in Washington, El Paso has become an epicenter of Trump\u2019s immigration battle.\n\nBeyond erecting thicker, higher and more barriers to close off the border, the city is next door to Tornillo, Texas, where hundreds of young migrant children were held for months in tents.\n\nBeyond that, before Trump\u2019s administration told the public it was separating children from their parents on the border, it ran a pilot project in El Paso that took the children into government custody.\n\nThat has thrust Escobar and her border city in the middle of an epic tug of war between Congress and the executive branch.\n\nBut she was in a similar fight before, one that put her on a political track that led to Congress.\n\nClimbing alfalfa plants, joining the political ranks\n\nAfter earning a Bachelor\u2019s degree in English literature at the University of Texas, El Paso, Escobar left El Paso to study at New York University.\n\nShe earned her master\u2019s there in the same subject and then returned home with a plan to earn a little money and head to the West Coast to study Chicano literature, earn a doctorate and join academia.\n\nBut back in El Paso, she found her hometown in the throes of a national debate over immigration.\n\nThe Border Patrol was sending agents into Bowie High School in El Paso, to check whether students were citizens and to follow them to their homes in a neighborhood known as the Segundo Barrio, also right on the border, Escobar said.\n\nThe actions led to a lawsuit, and changes were made but talk began of a building a wall in El Paso.\n\nEscobar said she saw members of a local group, the Border Rights Coalition, fight back. They documented abuses, educated people about the ongoing debate, connected them with classes in English as a Second Language and citizenship, and taught them their rights.\n\n\u201cI thought, I\u2019ve got to do something,\u201d she said, so she volunteered with the Border Coalition and from there things \u201csnowballed.\u201d She was soon volunteering to help on a congressional campaign in 1996.\n\nThe candidate, her friend Jose Luis Sanchez, lost his bid, leaving her heartbroken and wanting to end her dip into politics.\n\nBut she couldn\u2019t stay away. She continued volunteering for campaigns over the next decade. Then in 2005, three friends, including then political neophyte Beto O\u2019Rourke, ran for city council and won.\n\nThe city\u2019s mayor Ray Caballero, who Escobar worked for as communications director, then turned to Escobar.\n\n\u201cMayor Caballero, right after they won, called me and bullied me over an entire summer, saying \u2018It\u2019s your turn.\u201d She turned him down repeatedly, despite his many calls and encouragement to seek a county office.\n\n\u201cI kept telling him I\u2019d recruit someone to run,\" Escobar said. \"He finally one day told me, \u2018How can you ask other people to do something that you are unwilling to do?\u2019\u201d\n\nEscobar was elected to her first public office, El Paso County commissioner, in 2006.\n\nShe moved on, winning election to El Paso County judge, the county\u2019s top executive overseeing the commission. She was re-elected and remained in the job until resigning to run for Congress in 2018.\n\nEscobar, O\u2019Rourke and two other friends on the City Council became known as the \u201cprogressives\u201d for their agendas for the city.\n\n\u201cWe were fighting for the \u2018El Chuco\u2019 we knew we deserved,\u201d she said, referring to the Mexican-American name for El Paso, which comes from the pachuco lifestyle of the 1930s and \u201940s that originated in the city and was exported to the western United States.\n\n\u201cWe were part of a generation that left El Paso for better opportunity, a generation that felt like, why are the jobs elsewhere? Why is the quality of life elsewhere? Why are the great downtowns elsewhere? Why are the great neighborhoods elsewhere? Why hasn\u2019t anybody been fighting for that? For us?\u201d\n\nVeronica Escobar, center, in her 1986 yearbook photo during her junior year at Burges High School in El Paso. Courtesy Rep. Veronica Escobar\n\nAt a recent town hall in El Paso, Isabela Escobar, Escobar\u2019s mother, watched with pride while her daughter fielded some tough questions from constituents with aplomb. The self-assurance in her daughter is not new, she said.\n\n\u201cShe was a traviesa,\u201d Isabela Escobar said, using a Spanish word that means playful and a little mischievous.\n\n\u201cShe would climb the high stacks of alfalfa when she was 3 years old. I don\u2019t know how she ever got up there, but she used to run around on the farm,\u201d she said. \"In my culture, we say you show who you are going to be when you are a little girl or boy. She did.\u201d\n\nThe most diverse Congress tackles the border battle\n\nEscobar joins the most diverse Congress ever elected, including a record number of women, the first Muslim women, the first Palestinian-American, the first Somali-American, the first Native American women, the first Ecuadorian-American, a slew of millennials and the youngest woman ever to serve in Congress.\n\nThat, Escobar said, puts pressure on her and others to make sure they are not known as the \u201conlys.\u201d\n\nEscobar\u2019s first hire was her chief of staff, who is Latino. \u201cAs members of Congress, if we expect diversity, then we have to live it,\" she said. \"And we\u2019ve got to nurture that. We\u2019ve got to mentor that. Whether it be elected offices, appointed offices or hired staff.\"\n\nRep. Veronica Escobar, D-Texas, snaps a selfie while on the House floor with other women in Congress including House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California. Leah Herman / House of Representatives\n\nHer introduction to Congress was a baptism by fire.\n\nSoon after the celebrations of their swearing-ins, members were faced with the government shutdown and the wrestling match with the president over funding for the border wall.\n\nEscobar was one of 19 Democrats to vote against the $333 billion spending bill that reopened the government. It included $1.4 billion for border barriers, as well as more money for immigration detention beds and other immigration enforcement.\n\nEscobar said that she is not against certain types of fencing and enforcement altogether but that it needs to be better thought out so that it is targeting the drug trade and other threats but still protects wildlife and the environment. She said fencing in El Paso now is rusting and is making \u201cour country look like a junkyard.\u201d\n\nEscobar told The Hill that she rejected the bill\u2019s \u201cunderlying motivation about a crisis at our southern border\u201d and the erroneous narrative portraying the border as a problem.\n\nAt the town hall in El Paso, Escobar said she questioned the $192 million included in the bill for a central processing center to be built in El Paso for Customs and Border Protection to process arriving Central American immigrants. She also is questioning the bidding process.\n\nShe also objects to allocating funds to build border barriers, which could mean cutting money for military support and projects at Fort Bliss, including for a new William Beaumont Hospital on the military post.\n\nThis is all happening after investments in Border Patrol have tripled, while apprehensions of people on the border \u2014 used by Border Patrol to measure the level of illegal immigration \u2014 have dropped, she said.\n\n\u201cIf I did not say enough is enough, who would?\u201d Escobar told the town hall crowd. \u201cSo that day, I voted to say enough is enough.\u201d\n\nFOLLOW NBC LATINO ON FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND INSTAGRAM.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump on Monday will ask the U.S. Congress for an additional $8.6 billion to help pay for the wall he promised to build on the southern border with Mexico to combat illegal immigration and drug trafficking, officials familiar with his 2020 bu\u2026",
    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Monday will ask the U.S. Congress for an additional $8.6 billion to help pay for his promised wall on the U.S-Mexico border to combat illegal immigration and drug trafficking, officials familiar with his 2020 budget request told Reuters.\n\nThe demand, which drew swift criticism from Democrats, is more than six times what Congress allocated for border projects in each of the past two fiscal years, and 6 percent more than Trump has corralled by invoking emergency powers this year.\n\nDemocrats, who oppose the wall as unnecessary and immoral, control the U.S. House of Representatives, making it unlikely the Republican president\u2019s request will win congressional passage. Republicans control the Senate.\n\nThe proposal comes on the heels of a bruising battle with Congress over wall funding that resulted in a five-week partial federal government shutdown that ended in January, and could touch off a sequel just ahead of a trifecta of ominous fiscal deadlines looming this fall.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump hurt millions of Americans and caused widespread chaos when he recklessly shut down the government to try to get his expensive and ineffective wall,\u201d said Speaker of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer in a joint statement on Sunday.\n\n\u201cCongress refused to fund his wall and he was forced to admit defeat and reopen the government. The same thing will repeat itself if he tries this again. We hope he learned his lesson,\u201d said the two top Democrats in Congress.\n\nAsked on Fox News Sunday about the new wall funding request and if there would be another budget fight, White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said, \u201cI suppose there will be ... He\u2019s going to stay with his wall and he\u2019s going to stay with the border security theme. I think it\u2019s essential.\u201d\n\nBroadly speaking on the budget, Kudlow told Fox, \u201cThe president is proposing roughly a 5 percent across-the-board reduction in domestic spending accounts.\u201d\n\nRegardless of whether Congress passes it, the budget request could help Trump frame his argument on border security as the 2020 presidential race begins to take shape, with the president seeking re-election.\n\n\u201cBuild the wall\u201d was one of his signature campaign pledges in his first run for office in 2016. \u201cFinish the wall\u201d is already a feature of his re-election campaign, a rallying cry plastered across banners and signs at his campaign rallies.\n\n\u201cIt gives the president the ability to say he has fulfilled his commitment to gain operational control of the southwest border,\u201d an administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said of the budget request.\n\n\u201cWe have provided the course of action, the strategy and the request to finish the job. It\u2019s a question of, will Congress allow us to finish the job,\u201d a second administration official said.\n\nFunding legislation needs to be passed before Oct. 1 - the start of the 2020 federal fiscal year - or the government could shut down again. If Congress and the White House fail to agree to lift mandatory spending caps set in a 2011 law, steep automatic cuts in many programs would kick in. Around the same time, Trump and lawmakers must agree to lift the debt ceiling, or risk a default, which would have chaotic economic fallout.\n\n722 MILES OF WALL\n\nTrump\u2019s wall request is based off a 2017 plan put forward by Customs and Border Protection officials to build or replace 722 miles (1,162 km) of barrier along the border, which in total is estimated to cost about $18 billion.\n\nSo far, only 111 miles (179 km) have been built or are under way, officials said. In fiscal 2017, $341 million in funding was allocated for 40 miles (64 km) of wall, and in 2018, another $1.375 billion was directed to 82 miles (132 km).\n\nFor fiscal 2019, Trump demanded $5.7 billion in wall funds, but Congress appropriated only $1.375 billion for border fencing projects.\n\nFollowing the rejection of his wall funding demand, Trump declared the border was a national emergency - a move opposed by Democrats and some Republicans - and redirected $601 million in Treasury Department forfeiture funds, $2.5 billion in Defense Department drug interdiction funds and $3.6 billion from a military construction budget, for total spending of $8.1 billion for the wall.\n\nThe administration has not estimated how far the 2019 funds will go, but officials said average costs are about $25 million per mile (1.6 km).\n\nTrump\u2019s $8.6 billion in proposed wall funding for fiscal 2020 would include $5 billion from the Department of Homeland Security budget and $3.6 billion from the Pentagon\u2019s military construction budget. The budget proposal will also include another $3.6 million in military construction funding to make up for any projects delayed by the wall, officials said.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security is one of a few priority areas to get a boost in Trump\u2019s budget plan, which seeks to slash funding to many non-defense programs.\n\nTrump will propose an overall 5 percent increase to the Department of Homeland Security budget over fiscal 2019 appropriations, including $3.3 billion, or 22 percent more, for Customs and Border Protection, and $1.2 billion more for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a 16 percent hike, officials said.\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump gestures during a rally at El Paso County Coliseum in El Paso, Texas, U.S., February 11, 2019. REUTERS/Leah Millis/File Photo\n\nThe budget proposal includes a plan to hire more than 2,800 law enforcement and support personnel for the agencies, and 100 immigration judge teams, officials said.\n\nTrump faces both political and court battles to free up the money he wants for the current fiscal year. Many lawmakers accused Trump of overstepping his constitutional powers by declaring an emergency to free up the funds. The House has already voted to revoke the emergency, and the Senate is likely to do the same this week. Trump is expected to veto the resolution.\n\nA coalition of state governments led by California has sued Trump to block the emergency move, though legal experts have said the lawsuits face a difficult road.",

    "description": "Speaking in London Wednesday, Stacey Abrams laid out the tactics that saw Democrat rocket in Georgia's race for the governorship. Turnout went from 1.1 million to 1.9 million, bringing her within two points of becoming America's first black female state gover\u2026",
    "text": "Democratic rising star Stacey Abrams broke down the lessons from her race for governor in Georgia, and outlined why she thinks her party must make a radical break from the past to beat President Donald Trump in 2020.\n\nSpeaking at London's Chatham House think-tank on Wednesday, Abrams described how got within 55,000 votes of victory in the historically red state in November's mid-terms.\n\nHer tactics were a wholesale rejection of Democratic orthodoxy, and the divisive politics President Trump has been accused of waging.\n\nDemocratic gubernatorial candidate for Georgia, is welcomed by a crowd of supporters in Fayetteville, Georgia, U.S., October 25, 2018. REUTERS/Lawrence Bryant\n\nDemocrats are fiercely debating how to beat Trump in 2020, with some claiming that a narrow focus on so-called identity politics, or claims for recognition by minority communities, could turn away white voters and lead Democrats into the electoral wilderness.\n\nSome observers claim that Democrats' best hopes lie in addressing the concerns of voters who have deserted them for the Republican Party, such as the elderly and white blue-collar workers.\n\nBut Abrams said that the historic high turnout of black, Latino and Asian voters in the state \u2014 which nearly got her into office \u2014 vindicates her campaign's efforts to reach out and address the concerns of a swath of the electorate usually ignored.\n\n\"In our campaign we intentionally centered on people of color and marginalized communities. I proudly proclaimed myself an ally of the LGBTQ community, I talked about issues that were normally kept to the side or certainly avoided altogether in the Deep South,\" she said.\n\n\"Because I believe that people cannot vote for things that do not include them, and cannot be seen unless we speak them into existence.\"\n\nShe said that success will come from in embracing those who usually feel excluded from the political conversation, and giving them a voice.\n\n\"What I realised from my campaign \u2014 what we realised from the very beginning \u2014 is that people want to be seen. They want to be heard. They want to know that their lived experiences are valued and recognised and that the barriers that they face have the possibility of being eroded and moved away.\n\nFormer Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams delivers the Democratic response to the U.S. President Donald Trump's State of the Union address in this still frame taken from video, in Washington, U.S., February 5, 2019. REUTERS/Reuters TV\n\n\"They want to know that being a member of a community that is disabled does not mean they are excluded from participation.\n\nShe said that she was able to address the needs of diverse communities without alienating white voters \u2014 the most common fear of people who reject a focus on identity.\n\n\"Not only did we increase the turnout rates of all those communities of colour all those marginalized communities, I actually increased the white participation rate for Democrats for almost 25 years. This is what happens when identity politics takes center stage. All identities are recognised,\" she said.\n\n\"That is why, in our campaign we created opportunities for every single community to have a voice, to be seen and to be heard and to be invested in,\" remarked Abrams, the first black woman to run as a major party's candidate for state governor in US history.\n\nShe said that her campaign was the first to run ads statewide addressing Latino communities, reached out to voters in both rural areas and cities country and urban radio, and tailored its policies for minority communities.\n\nThe result: an increase in the Democrat vote from 1.1 million in 2014 to 1.9 million in 2019, including a surge of Latino and black voter turnout.\n\nAbrams lost narrowly to Republican Brian Kemp, whom she accused of abusing his office to purge thousands of Americans from minority communities from voter rolls during his tenure as Georgia's secretary of state.\n\nKemp has vehemently denied the accusations, and says he was combatting voter fraud. Abrams ended her bid to prevent Kemp taking office in November, and has founded the Fair Fight Action group to combat electoral suppression in the state.\n\nSince the loss, she has emerged as one of the key figures in the Democratic Party, delivering the party's response to Trump's February State of the Union address, where she accused the president of using the government shutdown as a \"stunt.\"\n\nOprah Winfrey takes part in a town hall meeting with Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams ahead of the mid-term election in Marietta, Georgia, U.S. November 1, 2018. REUTERS/Chris Aluka Berry\n\nRumours have swirled that Abrams is considering a 2020 presidential bid, but on Wednesday she steered clear of speculation.\n\nShe said which Democrat she backs in 2020 will be down to their stance on voter suppression rather than sexual or ethnic identity.\n\n\"I'm not governor in part because of voter suppression,\" remarked Abrams. \"My litmus test is not going to be a litmus test based on race or gender for who is going to be the next nominee for the Democrats - it's going to be whether you talk about voter suppression,\" she said.\n\n\"I would certainly would like to see a woman win, I'm an advocate of people of colour getting in higher and higher positions and to communities writ large, she said.\n\n\"We have to talk about voter suppression, because if we did not create space for people to cast their ballots, then our democracy is in trouble. And that is a danger to us all regardless of identity.\"",

    "text": "GOP donor Li Yang, who uses the name Cindy, has posted selfies on social media with Republican Party leaders and politicians \u2014 including Trump. She snapped a photo of herself with the president at a Super Bowl viewing party last month at Trump\u2019s West Palm Beach club. (Trump cheered for the team owned by his pal Kraft.)\n\nYang owns a string of spas and massage parlors in Florida with a \u201creputation\u201d of providing sexual services, the Miami Herald reported. She denies that she has ever broken the law.\n\nNow Mother Jones reports that \u201cconsulting company\u201d GY US Investments LLC, owned by Yang and her husband, Zubin Gong, offers fee-paying clients the \u201copportunity to interact with the president, the [U.S.] Minister of Commerce and other political figures,\u201d according to the magazine\u2019s translation of the firm\u2019s web site, which is mostly in Chinese.\n\nThe site also claims it can arrange a \u201cWhite House and Capitol Hill Dinner,\u201d according to Mother Jones.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear if access to the president was actually provided to clients. The business site posted photos of executives posing with Donald Trump Jr., according to the magazine.\n\nThe head of a Chinese electric car company posed with Eric Trump in a photo on New Year\u2019s eve at Mar-a-Lago. He had hoped to meet the president, but Trump skipped a trip to the club then due to the government shutdown. The Chinese executive told Mother Jones the trip was organized by a public relations company that he did not name.\n\nYang\u2019s business website was shut down Friday, the day the Miami Herald story about her was published. Yang\u2019s Facebook page packed with photos of her with leading Republicans was also taken down then.\n\nHer consulting site featured Yang posing next to Trump in a signed photo, and said she was on the \u201cPresidential Fundraising Committee,\u201d according to Mother Jones.\n\nYang\u2019s consulting company promoted an upcoming event at Mar-a-Lago featuring Trump\u2019s sister, Elizabeth Trump Grau, the magazine reported.

Since 2017 she and her relatives have donated more than $42,000 to a Trump political action committee and more than $16,000 to Trump\u2019s campaign, according to the newspaper.\n\nYang\u2019s business is troubling because it raises the specter that only the wealthy can have the president\u2019s ear. The elite few members of Mar-a-Lago, who pay $200,000 for a membership, have clearly been given special treatment by the president. ProPublica reported Wednesday that a policy suggestion written on a Mar-a-Lago napkin by a Pennsylvania dentist and member that began \u201cDear King,\u201d was ordered by the president to be passed onto the secretary of Veterans Affairs.\n\nProPublica reported last year that Trump granted sweeping influence over Veterans Affairs to resort member Ike Perlmutter, chairman of Marvel Entertainment and was a major Trump campaign donor.\n\nBut also troubling, a security expert noted, is that a woman linked to massage parlors and Republican leaders could be in a position to blackmail powerful politicians.\n\nIt could present a \u201ctextbook story of how foreign actors gain leverage over senior officials,\u201d David Rothkopf, a visiting scholar of the Carnegie Endowment and CEO of the Rothkopf Group, wrote in the Daily Beast Saturday in response to the Mother Jones story.\n\nIf the president is allowing Yang to sell access at Mar-a-Lago to Chinese business people \u201cwhile his friends are getting serviced at businesses she started, he is making himself and the country vulnerable to massive blackmail risk,\u201d Rothkopf warned.",

    "text": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez on Tuesday laid into Democrats and Republicans who've condemned freshman Rep. Ilhan Omar of making comments perceived by many as anti-Semitic.\n\nDemocratic leadership, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, is expected to put a resolution opposing anti-Semitism up for a vote in the House this week, after Omar in a tweet over the weekend accused pro-Israel lawmakers of pushing \"for allegiance to a foreign country.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez didn't defend Omar's comment but argued in a series of tweets that the fierce backlash the Minnesota Democrat is facing revealed a double standard in Congress' response to different forms of bigotry.\n\nShe added that Omar, who is Muslim and a Somali-American immigrant, \"has demonstrated a willingness to listen+work w/impacted communities\" and shouldn't be subjected to the \"nuclear option\" of a formal condemnation.\n\n\"One of the things that is hurtful about the extent to which reprimand is sought of Ilhan is that no one seeks this level of reprimand when members make statements about Latinx + other communities (during the shutdown, a GOP member yelled 'Go back to Puerto Rico!' on the floor),\" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted.\n\nShe said that lawmakers were often given a pass for misogynistic, racist, or anti-LGBTQ comments and that congressional leaders should be clear about what behavior merits formal condemnation.\n\n\"It's not my position to tell people how to feel, or that their hurt is invalid,\" Ocasio-Cortez said. \"But incidents like these do beg the question: where are the resolutions against homophobic statements? For anti-blackness? For xenophobia? For a member saying he'll 'send Obama home to Kenya?'\"\n\nOn Monday, Republican Rep. Steve King, who was stripped of his House committee seats in January following a controversial New York Times interview and renewed scrutiny over his many racist statements, promoted a white nationalist on Twitter. On Sunday, GOP Rep. Jim Jordan referred to the Democratic megadonor Tom Steyer as \"$teyer\" in a tweet, which some have also condemned as anti-Semitic, as Steyer's father was Jewish.\n\nOcasio-Cortez also argued that Omar's critics were attempting to silence voices that oppose Israeli government policy and are critical of US policy in the Middle East.\n\n\"I remember a time when it was 'unacceptable' to question the Iraq War,\" she tweeted, later clarifying that she meant to say the war in Afghanistan. \"All of Congress was wrong, including both GOP & Dem Party, and led my generation into a disastrous + wrong war that virtually all would come to regret, except for the one member who stood up: Barbara Lee.\"\n\nOmar supports the movement to boycott Israel and has been critical of the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. She has also been vocal in her opposition to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, one of the most powerful lobbying groups in Washington that nearly always aligns with the Israeli government.\n\nLast month, Democratic leaders in the House condemned another tweet in which Omar argued that pro-Israel American lawmakers were influenced by donations from groups like AIPAC. Omar apologized amid the intense backlash.\n\nThe Minnesota Democrat also faced criticism for saying in a tweet in November 2012, during the Israeli military campaign against Hamas, that \"Israel has hypnotized the world.\"\n\nOmar. Reuters/Eric Miller\n\nIslamophobic attacks\n\nOmar has also been a victim of bigoted attacks recently.\n\nLast Friday, the West Virginia Republican Party displayed a poster linking Omar with the 9/11 terrorist attacks during an event at the statehouse. The poster featured an image of the twin towers in flames with the words \"'Never Forget' \u2014 you said..\" above an image of Omar with the words \"I am the proof \u2014 you have forgotten.\"\n\nThe state Republican Party said in a statement that it never approved of or saw the poster before it was displayed and that it had it removed after learning of its existence.\n\nOcasio-Cortez said she was \"heartbroken\" that the state party didn't receive more criticism for the incident.\n\n\"Those who stood up against anti-Semitism a few weeks ago should also be calling out the Islamophobia here, too,\" she tweeted.\n\nOmar, who, along with Rep. Rashida Tlaib, is the first Muslim congresswoman, described it as one of many instances of Islamophobia she has faced.\n\n\"No wonder why I am on the 'Hitlist' of a domestic terrorist and 'Assassinate Ilhan Omar' is written on my local gas stations,\" she tweeted. \"Look no further, the GOP's anti-Muslim display likening me to a terrorist rocks in state capitols and no one is condemning them!\"\n\nMichelle Mark contributed to this report.",

On this image from the 'Inner Atlas - pt.1' series he wrote: 'Regarded as an art form, the sport of body surfing is one of the most primitive forms of wave riding. Historically celebrated for performances above the water surface, I felt intrigued to explore the rider's interaction with the power of the sea from an immersive perspective below.'\n\nImage of body surfer by Trent Mitchell, he writes: 'What does it feel like to be there, moving at the perfect speed, intimately connecting with the dynamics of the sea? To ride the formless edge between fear and joy in a single breath? I discovered a physical and emotive space where man, movement and energy fuse during a journey of self-discovery and inner harmony.'\n\nChristian Vizl is a Mexican photographer who specializes in underwater photography. He wrote: ' I have devoted my life to exploring and contemplating the amazing beauty of the ocean and it has been an incredible journey that has brought me a deep feeling of connection with nature, but sadly during my lifetime I have witness the ever-increasing devastation that we humans are creating on this planet.'\n\nChristian Vizl uses his work to highlight the plight facing our planet: 'Today the world's oceans are in grave danger. Overfishing, pollution, plastics, radiation, climate change, acidification and other human pressures threaten the fundamental nature of the ocean and its animals are being pushed to near extinction. The time to act and reverse our negative impact is now, before it's too late and we risk losing everything. For this series I chose a few emblematic animals that inhabit the world's oceans, because I believe they have the power to promote empathy and initiate change.'\n\nLiang Fu: 'A cleaning station is like a mutual symbiotic community underwater.

The grouper and moray eel have their dead skin, bacteria, and parasites cleaned by the shrimps and wrasse, while at the same time the cleaner species receive nutrients and protection from the fishes.'\n\nLiang Fu: 'I have spent years studying the symbiotic behavior between shrimps and different fish underwater. The photos I took are from different locations, showing a lively mutual symbiosis relationship.'\n\nImma Barrera is a Spanish photographer based in the U.S.: This image is part of her current project is raising awareness about the importance of nature conservation efforts and in particular, protecting the night sky from light pollution. 'Preserving the night environment helps support human health and heritage and preserve wildlife habitats.\n\nImma Barrera writes: Night photography offers a chance to capture and document scenes that few people ever see nowadays due to artificial light and air glow pollution and can be truly inspiring. This selection includes Milky Way captures and star trails (the movement of the stars due to the earth's rotation, captured during a period of at least one hour but usually longer),' The images were taken at three very different locations: Joshua Tree National Park in California, one of the four Gold Tier International Dark Sky Parks in the US; the New Jersey Atlantic Shore and the Catskills Mountains in New York\n\nBrent Stirton is a South African Photographer based in New York: This image features a member of the Akashinga, meaning 'the brave ones' in Zimbabwe's Shona dialect, an all-female, community-driven conservation model. The group empowers severely disadvantaged women to restore and manage a network of wilderness areas as an alternative to trophy hunting.\n\nPhoto taken by Brent Stirton in Phundundu Wildlife Area, Zimbabwe in June 2018.: The International Anti-Poaching Foundation created the Akashinga conservation rangers in late 2017, using an all-female team to manage an entire nature reserve in Zimbabwe. These women come from the most disadvantaged backgrounds, many the victims of rape, domestic abuse and exploitation. Through this program they have re-empowered themselves and through their many successes they have become an example to women all across Africa. The members of Akashinga have a community-driven, interpersonal focus, working with, rather than against, the local population for the long-term benefit of their own communities and nature.\n\nThrough this image Italian photographer Federico Borella asks the question: 'Could the dramatic increase in Indian farmers who take their own lives be closely connected to climate change and rising temperatures? A study from Berkeley University, found a correlation between climate change and suicide among Indian farmers. It is estimated that 59,300 farmer suicides over the last 30 years are attributable to climate change. According to experts, temperatures in India could increase by another 5\u00b0F by 2050. Without focused government intervention, global warming will lead to more suicides all over India. But what leads farmers to this extreme act? They run into debt through investing in production, and repaying previous loans. Despite these efforts, harvests damaged by adverse weather, and short-sighted water management lead to debt repayment failure. The impact of climate change affects global well being, going beyond India and threatening mankind as a whole. This project is located in Tamil Nadu, the southernmost state of India, which is facing the worst drought for 140 years.\n\nTaken by Federico Borella in India, Tamil Nadu, in May 2018.

According to a study carried out by Tamma A. Carleton, the warming over the last 30 years is responsible for 59.300 suicides in India. She estimates that fluctuations in climate, particularly temperature, significantly influence suicide rates\n\nBoyuan Zhang is a Chinese photographer on this image he writes: 'Xinjiang is the largest autonomous region in North Western China, where I was born. For hundreds and thousands of years it used to be known as the Western Regions and is now a place where dozens of ethnic groups cohabit. Walking along the river, you can see the rapid development of the social system, while seeing the legacy of human civilization from thousands of years ago.'\n\nBoyuan Zhang writes: 'If you haven't seen the Buddhist temple ruins, murals and artifacts that were buried under the sand dunes, it is impossible to imagine that the place that was once called Altishahr in the Qing Dynasty and was a holy place of Mahayana Buddhism in the sixth century. The replacement of civilization is just like a city in the desert: it appears after being blown by the wind, eroded by the wind, and, finally, obscured by the sands'\n\n'Every day is another chance' is an ongoing series by Caribbean photographer Kacey Jeffers about the links between personal mythologies within her family.: 'In September, I returned to Nevis (a former British colony in the Caribbean; population 12,000) after three years in New York City. Feral monkeys, donkeys, goats and sheep still charmingly regulate traffic; inertia and frustration linger in the warm breeze, mingling with the unfulfilled promises of sun, sea, and sand.'\n\nPhotographer Kacey Jeffers: 'My new life in the US was a seismic cultural shift: festering racial tensions thrust on me a notion of blackness that felt like indoctrination. Meanwhile, Americans scrambled to reassess the potency - the relevancy - of the American dream. Initially, this project stemmed from a desire to just keep shooting. Eventually, through familiar entrances, exits, and the unpacking of unresolved feelings, I am finding beauty and healing in once vulnerable places. This enables me to be both an actor in, and a witness to this story; assimilating socio-economic-cultural circumstances into my creative process'\n\nZhipeng Zhu is a Chinese photographer: 'The dormitory is the living space of College students. The objects in the dormitory embody personal hobbies, habits and so on.'\n\nZhipeng Zhu writes: 'I exaggerate the articles in the dormitory to show the personality of these people. I call these individualized objects dormitory furniture, which are the most characteristic items of these people in the dormitory. Through this, I can see that Some personal possessions can show their interesting features.'\n\nAn image by Marta Moreiras, Based in Dakar, Senegal. The 'P\u00e8res' series is born as a reflection on fatherhood, to promote gender equality and social development in Africa: 'We live in a world permeated by stereotypes, of which we are often victims. P\u00e8res questions these clich\u00e9s that we carry as a burden, in a literal way and also symbolically, to create a pathway towards an open dialogue on a crucial and significant matter.'\n\nMarta Moreiras: 'P\u00e8res aims to inspire social change and strives to support women in their battle for gender equality. It is a symbolic act that implies an invitation to reflect on gender roles. These portraits make the role of the father visible as well as promoting a more balanced family model, where fathers are engaged in the education and care of their children at the same level as mothers.

The Chukchi, a Paleo-Siberian tribe from the Russian side of the Bering Strait may be key to understanding how America was inhabited. In Chukchi culture, past, present and future are intimately linked. You are not just you: you are your father, your grandfather and your great-grandfather, back to the first Bering Strait hunter. Thanks to population genetics research we are now certain that the first Chukchi hunters left their genetic footprint in all Native American people when they first settled in America. From the Navajo to the Mayans; from Alaska to Tierra de Fuego. The Edge combines this poetic yet powerful idea of shared memory and science through population genetics data analysis for every participant. A visual journey where past and future combine, exploring a period of our history full of unanswered questions and raising new ones about our understanding of current migratory processes across the entire American continent.'\n\nAn image by Alvaro Laiz.

The chon ji tul, which means heaven and Earth is the first tul (pattern) taught to beginners. General Choi Hong Hi, who was born in North Korea and served both the Japanese and Korean armies throughout his military career, developed his own movements which were officially recognized as the martial art of Taekwondo on April 11, 1955.'\n\nPhotographer Alain Schroeder: Although the origins of martial arts are shrouded in mystery, since time immemorial men have used their hands and feet for self-protection. Influenced by a combination of historical events in Korea and Japanese traditions, the modern incarnation of Korea's national martial art Taekwondo ('way of kick and fist') was created in 1955 by General Choi Hong-hi. Born in what is now North Korea, his idea was to develop a specific martial art to demonstrate the spirit and wisdom of the Korean nation to the outside world. Taekwondo is extremely popular in North Korea. It is taught in every school and is part of the daily sports and health routine of all DPRK citizens. After 50 years of existence, the art of kicks has 60 million practitioners in more than 120 countries. Taekwondo became a medal sport at the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games.'\n\nAlain Schroeder\n\nAlain Schroeder\n\nChris Donovan is a Canadian documentary photographer. A portrait of Tasha Oteino: 'It's Wednesday night, and Tasha Otieno sits in her boyfriend's home in a densely populated neighbourhood in Nairobi. She has just returned from hockey practice. The room smells of tea and ugali (cornmeal porridge) and the only light comes from a TV in the living room. The game is on - again. It's the 2010 Olympic women's hockey gold-medal match, streaming on YouTube. Canada versus the United States. The 23-year-old is glued to the screen, screaming at the referees as though she hadn't already watched the game a dozen times before. Tasha is not alone in Kenya when it comes to a love of ice hockey. She is one of five women who play on the Nairobi Ice Lions, East Africa's sole ice hockey team made up of around five women and 25 men.'\n\nImage by Chris Donovan featuring Tasha Oteino : 'As the country enters the final stages of creating the Kenyan Ice Hockey Federation, plans are in the works to build a men's national hockey team. But where does that leave the women? Right now there are not enough players to support a women's team, but that doesn't stop Otieno and her teammates -- Carroll Joseph, Alexcy Wambui, Faith Wambui and Faith Sihoho -- from making big plans. 'I think one day you will see Kenyan women playing hockey at the Olympics,' Carroll says. 'When we were little, there were no women playing ice hockey in Kenya that we could look up to. We want to be those women for the next generation of Kenyan girls.'\n\nThomas Nielsen is a Danish photographer. Here he captures Brentford Football Club.

Athletes push themselves far beyond what is considered normal, some diving to depths of over 100 meters, and holding their breath for over ten minutes. It may seem like a crazy extreme sport, reserved only for suicidal adrenaline junkies, but when you look closely at a freediver beneath the surface, you may find that it is quite the opposite.'\n\nKohei Ueno: 'Freedivers dive in a meditative state, lowering their heart rate and relaxing their body to consume the least amount of oxygen. Calmness, stillness, peace and silence, the words often used to describe this sport, are what I try to portray in the photos.'

This image was taken in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Goma in May 2018: '18 year-old Blandini portrayed on the building site where she occasionally spend her nights. She also trains in the so-called Friendship Boxing Club. Blandini says 'We live under the threat of being beaten and violated by men, in a general condition of discrimination. I was kicked out of my family by my mother's second husband and found myself on the streets. For a living I do little jobs at people's houses, although my biggest concerns are about defending myself. That's why I do boxing: to prepare myself for life, to become a champion and maybe earn a living. My husband left me when my second child was born, leaving me completely unprotected. Once I was covered with petroleum by a group of men and set alight like a candle. The scars on my neck and my arm are the reminder of that night.'\n\nFilippo Gobbato writes: 'Elyse, 16 years old. portrayed on the streets of central Goma, she is part of one of the official boxing clubs in Goma. Elys\u00c3\u00a8e tells me: 'I've been boxing for 2 years, it's something that gives me strength and courage to defend myself and makes me feel accepted everywhere. In this city there is so much violence that you must always be ready to react. Under the ashes of this society there are latent conflicts, a violence ready to explode at any moment. Thanks to boxing I feel ready to face these dangers.' Taken in Democratic Republic of Congo, Goma, in May 2018\n\nFilippo Gobbato writes: 'I went to Marrakech to visit a friend , but I got lost in the medina, and was robbed by some boys. I was too scared to fight back. I stayed in my friend's house without going out for days. Then I decided to get out. I met a neighborhood boy and told him what happened. He invited me to follow him. We ran for quite some time and arrived in a dark place where some boys were boxing. 'If you trust me, I'll make you a strong man and you won't be scared anymore,' said the master. I practised with them, sweating and swearing. On my last day, I asked to take some photos. I wanted to illustrate this weird, funny group of boxers. I found something grotesque but also something sweet in them. They look very ramshackle but very determined, as if they're screaming: 'We are the boxers of Marrakech and nobody can stop us!'\n\nPhotographer Stefanie Dollhopf writes: 'These are photos of Japanese handicrafts that I bought in Japan.

This heightened realization of causality and fear of the ultimate futility of attempts at gaining control in this causal process present themselves as a bizarre visual fiction.'\n\nKui Su writes: 'My work attempts to show the possibilities of photography in a new form. Based on defamiliarization and recognition of things, this group of works called 'Daydream' focuses on small objects that are neglected in life and the creative potential of ordinary things.'\n\nKui Su writes: 'In the process of shooting, the object is placed in different backgrounds, and by blurring the boundaries between photography and painting, the work tries to liberate commonplace things from the specific context and inertia of daily life. At the same time,,the work aims to explore the expressive possibilities of usual things and find a new photographic language.\n\nKui Su: 'I believe that the inertia of life gradually erodes people's perception, making it difficult to discover and innovate. At the same time, by letting 'things' appear on the scene, showing their artistic value, I want to reflect on people's crazy shopping behaviour in the context of consumerism and the excess, waste and forgetting of 'things' associated with it.'\n\nNicolas Gaspardel and Pauline Baert: With a touch of mockery, Beurk Magazine photographs food every day through metaphors that are as poetic as they are disturbing. For Beurk Magazine society is yuck in a pop culture universe: 'Our creative approach is composed of antithesis. Dali amused himself by composing works with irrational associations of forms, images and objects; Maurizio Cattelan, meanwhile, focuses on the subversion of symbols and provocation; we are somewhere in between, with a more general than personal point of view and a desire to give ugliness an artificial beauty. Food is at the center of our ideas, which are magnified, manipulated and reworked to highlight our message. The pop tone, tight shots and especially the titles are an integral part of our signature.'\n\nPhotographer Cletus Nelson Nwadike writes: 'The civil war between Nigeria and Biafra was paid for with our blood, our future, and our imagination. More than 2 million souls died in vain. It was the most expensive war in the history of mankind. 51 years have passed and we are still trying to pay off our debts.'\n\nCletus Nelson Nwadike: 'Photography came and gave me back my imagination and liberation. When the light became my mentor, I changed perspective and I wish for the shutter speed to slow down and let more light into my country and my dreams.'\n\nMassimo Govannini writes: 'Henk - a Japanese word composed of kanjis meaning chang and variable/unusual light - conveys the idea of a shifting light which transforms our perception of the objects it illuminates. The work is not intended to trick the viewer, only to introduce doubt; to make them question preconceived ideas on gender and the presumed veracity of even the most candid photographic image.'\n\nMassimo Govannini writes: 'Apart from retouches to soften or accentuate the Adam's apple, the images were not Photoshopped in post-production. Only lighting, make up and the subject's facial expressions convey the symbolic gender reassignment. The choice of format - traditional photographic portraits in diptychs - and the seemingly simple image conceal the complexity of the subject matter, forcing the viewer to question the medium and their ability to see through it. If lighting and a skin-deep makeover can make viewers question their understanding of gender, perhaps the border between masculine and feminine is hazier than we are led to believe?'\n\nMaela Ohana writes: 'Two Headed Eagle is a collection of botanical portraits and landscape photographs shot during the short moments of dusk and dawn. During the golden hour, a sense of mystery envelops the landscape, creating uncanny interactions between flora and their natural surroundings.'\n\nMaela Ohana writes: 'Most of these images were shot in February 2018, when I spent a month hiking in the Sierra Madre mountains of Oaxaca, and along the Pacific Coast.

In doing so, the topsoil of the entire area is replaced by a type of red, semi-artificial soil, which forms the base for introduced, mostly non-indigenous plants, including thousands of mature trees. Meanwhile, green plastic netting is used to cover everything unappealing to the eye, from construction waste to disused quarries.'\n\nYan Wang Preston writes: 'The town's objective here has shifted from an ecological concern to a cosmetic one of trying to be visually green.

People made their living by fishing, farming and animal husbandry; their lives were dependent on Lake Hamun. With Hamun dying, its great biodiversity has virtually vanished. The province has suffered from drought, famine, and unemployment for years. This has led to depopulation.

It was to be enforced by fines handed out by Police and could even result in jail time for repeat offenders. It became the fourth European country to enact such a law. While not specifically stating so, the ban would prevent Muslim women from wearing the niqab or burqa, a piece of cloth hiding the face, in public. Some politicians asserted that the law was created in the interest of public safety as well as secular and democratic values. But many people quoted in local media felt that it was an easy way for the government to appease a growing nationalist voter base.'\n\nAndrew Kelly: 'Numerous social media campaigns in Denmark demanded stricter laws on non-western immigrants, a reflection of a rising populism appearing in Europe.

As a photographer traveling across Romania, I watched villages and towns being architecturally transformed during recent years, as a consequence of cultural appropriation and as part of the globalization process. I photographed the remains of a so-called 'traditional' world and also a more 'modern' approach to the concept of home, featuring imposing, palace-like houses and apartment complexes built on cities' outskirts. By isolating them in natural landscapes, as a form of decontextualization, I questioned the meanings and attributes of these habitats, and how they are reflected in the fluidity of architectural styles. Is the house still a primordial site, or have its functions diminished to the merely utilitarian? Has the house been relocated from the center of the world to its periphery?'\n\nStephan Zirwes: 'In Germany, pools are public.

    "title": "Trump immigration policy under scrutiny at four simultaneous congressional hearings",
    "description": "Hearings feature the first testimony before the new Congress from Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.",
    "text": "Congressional Democrats waited two years for an opportunity to scrutinize the Trump administration's immigration policies and on Wednesday they're going all in.\n\nCongress is hosting four simultaneous committee hearings \u2014 three in the Democrat-controlled House \u2014 that will analyze a wide range of actions taken by President Donald Trump to crack down on legal and illegal immigration.\n\nThe hearings will feature the first testimony before the new Congress from Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan and Homeland Security's inspector general.\n\nDemocratic leaders have been stepping up their oversight of the Trump administration in recent weeks, issuing their first subpoena last week and requesting documents on Monday from 81 \"agencies, entities and individuals\" with ties to Trump.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen testifies before the Homeland Security Committee hearing on \"The Way Forward on Border Security.\" on March 6, 2019 in Washington D.C. (Photo: Jack Gruber, USAT)\n\nWednesday's hearings will explore the origins and implementation of the administration's \"zero tolerance\" policy that led to at least 2,800 separations of migrant families, conditions in Border Patrol facilities that led to three deaths in three months, the decisions to terminate temporary deportation protections for more than 1 million people, and other controversial moves.\n\n\"It's going to be a day where the sunlight shines on what the Trump administration has been doing,\" said Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, a group that advocates on behalf of immigrants. \"It's long past time that the administration has had to answer some real questions.\"\n\nCLOSE Democrats on a House panel hammered Homeland Security chief Kirstjen Nielsen over the recent death of a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl who recently crossed the border and died from shock and dehydration in U.S. custody. (Dec. 20) AP\n\nAdministration officials argue they are simply carrying out the mandate given to them when Trump won the 2016 election largely by vowing to regain control of the nation's immigration system by whatever means necessary.\n\nThat's why administration officials see Wednesday's gauntlet of hearings as little more than a series of political stunts aimed more at the 2020 elections than any actual concern for immigrants or the system they use to enter the country.\n\n\"(Democrats) are trying to set the stage for the election next year, trying to do opposition research on the taxpayer's dime, trying to shape the discussion of the issue more to their liking,\" said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that advocates for lower levels of legal and illegal immigration. \"They're doing what comes natural to an opposition party. But because it's Trump, they're dialing everything up to 11.\"\n\nHomeland Security secretary testifies\n\nNielsen, who has been the public face of the Trump administration's immigration enforcement efforts, is the sole witness scheduled to testify before a House Homeland Security Committee hearing.\n\nThe secretary has become one of Trump's longest-tenured Cabinet members by implementing some of his most controversial orders and defending them wholeheartedly. Her department carried out family separations along the border, increased arrests of undocumented immigrants living throughout the U.S. and has overseen efforts to expand the southern border wall. That included a visit by Nielsen to southern California in October to install a plaque with Trump's name on it to a section of replacement barrier that was approved under the Obama administration and completed last year.\n\nHer last appearance before Congress in December offered a hint of what may come on Wednesday, when she repeatedly clashed with Democrats on the committee. At one point, she responded to a Democratic member who accused her of lying about the department's family separation policy by saying: \"Calling me a liar are fighting words.\"\n\nCustoms and Border Protection chief testifies\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection Kevin McAleenan speaks with USA TODAY's Editorial Board on Sept. 17, 2018, in McLean, Va. (Photo: Christopher Powers, USA TODAY)\n\nMcAleenan, whose agency includes customs officers who work at ports of entry and Border Patrol agents who patrol the regions in between, has also come under fire for his agency's treatment of migrants along the southern border.\n\nThree migrants, including two children, died in Customs and Border Protection custody in the past three months. The agency was criticized for firing tear gas into crowds of men, women and children in Tijuana in November as members of a migrant caravan tried to enter the U.S. to request asylum.\n\nMcAleenan has said his agents are simply overwhelmed by a historic shift in migration patterns. In years past, most people attempting to cross the southern border were young men from Mexico trying to sneak across and avoid being arrested. The majority of migrants are now Central American families who seek out Border Patrol agents to request asylum, requiring agents to care for them while still patrolling for drug smugglers and undocumented immigrants.\n\nThe commissioner is scheduled to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n\nDACA and TPS recipients plead for help\n\nThe Supreme Court is at the center of the debate over President Trump's effort to end former President Barack Obama's DACA program. (Photo: J. Scott Applewhite, AP)\n\nAs Trump has focused on his border wall and congressional Democrats have focused on the treatment of minors along the southern border, Dreamers have found themselves in an unsettling, yet familiar position: on the back burner.\n\nIn 2017, Trump tried to end the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which has shielded from deportation more than 800,000 Dreamers, or undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children. Federal courts blocked that move, and the Supreme Court has not yet taken up the case, meaning the program remains intact but far from secure.\n\nThe Trump administration has also tried to phase out the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program, which has allowed more than 300,000 foreigners from countries ravaged by wars and natural disasters to legally live and work in the U.S. A federal judge blocked that decision for four countries \u2014 El Salvador, Haiti, Nicaragua and Sudan \u2014 prompting the administration to postpone its efforts to end the program for two other countries, Honduras and Nepal.\n\nMore than 75 DACA and TPS recipients are flying into Washington, D.C., to attend a hearing Wednesday before the House Judiciary Committee and lobby members of Congress to pass a law to protect them. Legislators briefly considered including permanent protections for them during the negotiations to end the government shutdown earlier this year, but they were eventually removed and find themselves starting from scratch.\n\n\"I've set my expectations low, but I keep my hopes high,\" said Jesus Contreras, 25, a DACA recipient and paramedic from Houston who arrived in Washington on Tuesday to push for a DACA bill. \"The majority of Americans want this to happen for us, it's just finding something these congressmen and -women are going to sign.\"\n\nHomeland Security watchdog testifies\n\nUntil Democrats regained control of Congress, the only government groups scrutinizing the Trump administration were inspectors general in each department. On Wednesday, Homeland Security's watchdog is expected to appear before the House Appropriations Committee.\n\nThe purpose of the hearing is to analyze the Inspector General's budget, but members are expected to wade into some of the 89 reports published in 2018. That included reports criticizing the implementation of the administration's family separation policy, its handling of disaster aid following Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, and other immigration enforcement concerns.\n\nRead or Share this story: https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/03/05/immigration-policy-daca-tps-cbp-border-trump-dreamers-kirstjen-nielsen/3065181002/",

    "description": "The Senate stands up to Trump on Yemen and the wall.",
    "text": "President Trump attends a briefing at the White House Wednesday on drug trafficking at the southern border. (Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nWith Joanie Greve and Mariana Alfaro\n\nTHE BIG IDEA: Over the vocal objections of the Trump administration, the Senate voted 54 to 46 yesterday to cut off U.S. support for the vicious, Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen. The invocation of the War Powers Act will soon be taken up in the House, where it has more than enough support to pass.\n\nLater today, the Senate is poised to pass the resolution of disapproval that rebukes President Trump\u2019s national emergency declaration at the U.S.-Mexico border. It has already advanced through the House.\n\nSeven Senate Republicans broke ranks on Yemen, and the White House now expects between 10 to 12 GOP senators will defect on today\u2019s wall vote, a senior administration official told my colleague Josh Dawsey last night.\n\nComing from a Senate that\u2019s proved so pliant to Trump\u2019s whims over the past two years, the back-to-back votes are significant and could foreshadow more resistance \u2014 or independence \u2014 to come.\n\nTrump has promised he will veto both bills. These would be his first vetoes since taking office. Though neither the House nor the Senate has the two-thirds necessary to override him on either one, the resolution of disapproval will provide fodder for lawyers challenging the constitutionality of the emergency declaration in courts.\n\nThe one-two punch gets at the very heart of the separation of powers. Declaring war and spending money are bedrock powers assigned to Congress in the Constitution, but the legislative branch has abdicated both over time to what Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. called \u201cthe imperial presidency.\u201d\n\nTrump knows he\u2019s going to lose on the floor today, aides say, but he\u2019s trying to wrangle enough votes so that he\u2019s not embarrassed by a lopsided final count. To lock down the support of Sen. Martha McSally (R-Ariz.), for example, the administration promised that money for the wall won\u2019t be diverted from Arizona military construction projects.\n\nSens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) confer on Wednesday after the Senate voted to end U.S. support for the Saudi Arabian-led coalition fighting in Yemen. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\n-- Senate Republicans tried to give Trump an off-ramp to defuse what could be described as a constitutional crisis, but the president wouldn\u2019t take it. The president rejected a compromise plan put forward by Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), which would have allowed him to score a victory on the disapproval vote, because he did not want to foreclose the possibility of using emergency powers again in the future to advance policy objectives that Congress does not support. Indeed, if he gets away with this \u201cemergency,\u201d it seems like a pretty safe bet he\u2019ll be emboldened to try it again \u2014 as will future Democratic presidents. We\u2019re standing on a slippery slope.\n\n\u201cTrump called Lee to express his opposition as Lee lunched with fellow Republican senators at the Capitol. \u2026 Lee then relayed the information to his colleagues,\u201d Erica Werner, Seung Min Kim and John Wagner report. \u201cMany Senate Republicans had started to align behind Lee\u2019s measure, which would amend the National Emergencies Act to say an emergency declaration would automatically expire after 30 days unless both chambers of Congress vote to keep it. The goal is to give Congress the authority to approve a national emergency declaration \u2014 not to disapprove it, as is currently the case in law. If it had become law, Lee\u2019s bill could have affected Trump\u2019s national border emergency in the future, since ongoing national emergency declarations must be reaffirmed annually. And it would have affected future national emergencies declared by Trump, as well as by other presidents.\u201d\n\nLee also sponsored the Yemen resolution with Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Chris Murphy (D-Conn.). His father, Rex Lee, was Ronald Reagan\u2019s solicitor general, and he clerked for Sam Alito when the future justice sat on the Third Circuit. The 47-year-old defeated an incumbent GOP senator in 2010 by promising Utahans that he\u2019d stand up to presidents in both parties. \u201cCongress is supposed to be the first among the federal government\u2019s three co-equal branches,\u201d Lee said in a statement. \u201cFor decades, Congress has been giving far too much legislative power to the executive branch.\u201d\n\n-- On the national emergency vote, we\u2019ve got a running whip count on our website. Kate Rabinowitz has compiled what every Republican senator has said about Trump\u2019s declaration.\n\nThere are five hard \u201cyes\u201d votes on the resolution disapproval: Lee, Susan Collins (Maine), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Rand Paul (Ky.) and Thom Tillis (N.C.). Tillis and Collins are considered two of the most vulnerable incumbents up for reelection next year.\n\nLee, Susan Collins (Maine), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Rand Paul (Ky.) and Thom Tillis (N.C.). Tillis and Collins are considered two of the most vulnerable incumbents up for reelection next year. Six senators have publicly expressed concerns about the declaration: Lamar Alexander (Tenn.), Ted Cruz (Tex.), Cory Gardner (Colo.), Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Pat Toomey (Pa.).\n\nLamar Alexander (Tenn.), Ted Cruz (Tex.), Cory Gardner (Colo.), Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Pat Toomey (Pa.). The other 42 either oppose the resolution or have declined to comment.\n\n-- Twenty defections would be needed to override the veto, as Republicans have a 53-to-47 majority and Vice President Pence can cast a tiebreaking vote. No one thinks that will happen.\n\n-- The failure to make a deal with conservatives who wanted to find a way out is another indication of Pence\u2019s limited juice. He can\u2019t effectively speak for Trump when he\u2019s on the Hill, and he\u2019s not empowered to negotiate the way Joe Biden was, partly because he\u2019s been undercut so many times by POTUS.\n\n\u201cThere was an effort, numerous efforts, to engage with the vice president and the president,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn (R-Tex.). But \u201cthe president is not persuaded. I don\u2019t know of any president that likes to give up power.\u201d\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) talks with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) before the State of the Union last month. (Mandel Ngan/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n-- Trump has tried to reframe his power grab not as a constitutional question, but as a matter of national security. \u201cRepublican Senators are overthinking [the] vote on National Emergency,\u201d he tweeted yesterday. \u201cIt is very simply Border Security/No Crime \u2014 Should not be thought of any other way.\u201d\n\n-- But a lot of principled conservatives and libertarians don\u2019t see it that way. Indeed, today\u2019s vote will become a legacy-defining litmus test for many senators who fancy themselves as constitutionalists. \u201cThrough the legal fiction of an emergency, the old rules that governed America, and ensured some democratic check on executive power, are sidelined,\u201d writes National Review\u2019s Michael Brendan Dougherty. \u201cI happen to think Congress should fund more-extensive border security, including fencing. But conservatives have to defend the constitutional order that gives government acts the savor of legitimacy. That means Congress must reassert itself.\u201d\n\n-- Sen. Rand Paul (Ky.) is in that camp. \u201cI would literally lose my political soul if I decided to treat President Trump different than President Obama,\u201d the senator wrote in an op-ed for Fox News. \u201cEvery single Republican I know decried President Obama\u2019s use of executive power to legislate. We were right then. But the only way to be an honest officeholder is to stand up for the same principles no matter who is in power.\u201d\n\nPaul predicts the Supreme Court will \u201clikely\u201d strike down the declaration. \u201cIn fact, I think the president\u2019s own picks to the Supreme Court may rebuke him on this,\u201d he said. \u201cWith regard to the Constitution, the Supreme Court made it very clear in Youngstown Steel in 1952 \u2026 that there are three kinds of executive orders: orders that carry out an expressly voiced congressional position, orders where Congress\u2019 will is unclear, and, finally, orders clearly opposed to the will of Congress. \u2026 Without question, the president\u2019s order for more wall money contradicts the will of Congress. \u2026 My oath is to the Constitution, not to any man or political party.\u201d\n\n-- In the Youngstown case that Paul refers to, the Supreme Court blocked Harry Truman from seizing steel mills during the Korean War. In a recent piece for the American Conservative magazine that decried Trump\u2019s declaration, Republican lawyer Bruce Fein \u2014 a veteran of Reagan\u2019s Justice Department \u2014 recalled Robert Jackson\u2019s concurrence in the 1952 case. \u201cWith all its defects, delays and inconveniences, men have discovered no technique for long preserving free government except that the Executive be under the law, and that the law be made by parliamentary deliberations,\u201d Jackson wrote.\n\n\u201cOnly scrupulous adherence to constitutional processes will keep the law supreme in America,\u201d Fein added.\n\n-- James Madison, the architect of the Constitution, doesn\u2019t get to vote in the Senate today. But he argued poignantly, and timelessly, in Federalist 58 that Congress having the power of the purse is one of the people\u2019s most important checks on tyranny: \u201cThis power over the purse may, in fact, be regarded as the most complete and effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the people, for obtaining a redress of every grievance, and for carrying into effect every just and salutary measure.\u201d\n\nWelcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning briefing for decision-makers.\n\nSign up to receive the newsletter.\n\nWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\n\n-- Beto O\u2019Rourke is officially running for president. The former congressman and failed Senate candidate, who is in Iowa for the next few days, confirmed to the El Paso TV station KTSM that he's joining the crowded field. \u201cI'm really proud of what El Paso did and what El Paso represents,\u201d he texted the station last night. \u201cIt\u2019s a big part of why I\u2019m running.\u201d\n\n-- In his campaign announcement video, O'Rourke struck the same upbeat tone he used when he campaigned against Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) last year. Jenna Johnson reports: \u201cO\u2019Rourke\u2019s announcement came after months of public reflection that included a solo road trip through rural America, a heart-to-heart talk with Oprah Winfrey and rallying with supporters near the southern border. ... 'The challenges that we face right now, the interconnected crises in our economy, our democracy and our climate, have never been greater, and they will either consume us or they will afford us the greatest opportunity to unleash the genius of the United States of America,\u201d he said. \u201cIn other words, this moment of peril produces perhaps the greatest moment of promise for this country and for everyone inside of it.'\"\n\n-- Cover boy: O\u2019Rourke gets star treatment in next month\u2019s Vanity Fair -- with a photo spread by Annie Leibovitz.

And in a zero-sum world, his astounding run against Cruz in last year\u2019s Texas Senate race, historic as it was, was still a loss. ...\n\n\u201cO\u2019Rourke is acutely aware, too, of perhaps his biggest vulnerability \u2014 being a white man in a Democratic Party yearning for a woman or a person of color. ... \u2018The government at all levels is overly represented by white men,\u2019 he says. \u2018That\u2019s part of the problem, and I\u2019m a white man. So if I were to run, I think it\u2019s just so important that those who would comprise my team looked like this country. ... I totally understand people who will make a decision based on the fact that almost every single one of our presidents has been a white man, and they want something different for this country.

Luz Lazo, Michael Laris, Lori Aratani and Damian Paletta report: \u201cTrump announced the abrupt about-face Wednesday, after U.S. officials found themselves nearly alone in allowing the planes to remain in the air. As recently as Wednesday morning, both Boeing and the FAA had continued to say it was safe for the planes to fly. ... The investigation into the causes of the Ethiopian Airlines crash is in the earliest stages, and it is not clear whether hardware problems, software problems or some combination of factors caused the crash.\u201d\n\n-- Here are the issues the Ethiopia and Indonesia crashes have in common, per Emily Rauhala:\n\nBoth aircraft crashed just minutes after takeoff. Just 12 minutes into its journey to Pangkal Pinang, the Lion Air flight crashed into the sea off the coast of Java. The Ethiopian Airlines flight crashed roughly six minutes after leaving Addis Ababa.\n\nJust 12 minutes into its journey to Pangkal Pinang, the Lion Air flight crashed into the sea off the coast of Java. The Ethiopian Airlines flight crashed roughly six minutes after leaving Addis Ababa. Both flights struggled to gain altitude. The Lion Air flight failed to gain a cruising altitude of 27,000 feet, limiting the crew's room to gain control before the plane plummeted. Though the investigation into the Ethiopian Airlines crash is pending, preliminary data shows that the aircraft struggled to climb at a steady speed.\n\nThe Lion Air flight failed to gain a cruising altitude of 27,000 feet, limiting the crew's room to gain control before the plane plummeted. Though the investigation into the Ethiopian Airlines crash is pending, preliminary data shows that the aircraft struggled to climb at a steady speed. Both planes appeared to ascend and descend several times before crashing. The Lion Air plane pitched downward more than 24 times before its final plunge, all within its 12-minute journey. Though it is not yet clear what happened in the Ethiopian Airlines crash, the plane also appeared to ascend and descend while accelerating.\n\n-- Trump privately disparaged the Boeing 737, which he said \u201csucked,\u201d before he ordered the grounding. Toluse Olorunnipa and Josh Dawsey report: \u201cThe president said Boeing 737s paled in comparison to the Boeing 757 ... which he owns as a personal jet. ... He questioned why Boeing would keep building the model and opined that he never would have bought a 737 for the Trump Shuttle, the small airline he briefly ran three decades ago that relied on 727s before going bankrupt. ... Trump added to the confusion Wednesday by suggesting that the decision to ground the plane was 'psychologically' important but was neither urgent nor conclusive. ... The equivocation reflected an administration that was reluctant to take the step of imposing a nationwide suspension initially opposed by Boeing, the country\u2019s second-largest federal contractor.\u201d\n\nTrump should not have been the person making this decision, aviation experts said: \u201cTrump was inclined to announce a grounding on Tuesday, but he received pushback from the FAA, which had not yet reached a decision, according to officials familiar with the deliberations. But Trump also equivocated himself, telling advisers that grounding planes would cause panic and could hurt the stock market, according to two people who spoke to him. Federal regulators usually take the lead on making decisions related to safety, said Richard Aboulafia, an aerospace analyst with Teal Group. 'It\u2019s not the president\u2019s decision and it should never be the president\u2019s decision,' he said, adding that he did not know whether Trump broke any protocols.\u201d\n\n-- Trump wanted his personal pilot, John Dunkin, to become the FAA administrator, a position that\u2019s remained vacant since Barack Obama\u2019s appointee finished his term in January 2018. The absence of an FAA leader has been noticeable amid the Boeing fallout. Following an inquiry from The Washington Post, the White House declined to say whether Trump is still considering Dunkin for the job, or whether he plans to nominate someone in light of the pressure facing the agency. (Isaac Stanley-Becker)\n\n-- Wednesday's order grounds more than 70 U.S. aircraft. The Max 8 planes are used by American and Southwest airlines, which have a combined 58 of them in their fleets. United Airlines has 14 of the planes in its fleet.\n\n-- In November, a group of pilots met with Boeing executives to raise concerns about the 737 jet and complain about being left in the dark on some of the plane's new software. The meeting happened shortly after the Lion Air flight crashed off the coast of Indonesia. Aaron Gregg, Jonathan O'Connell, Andrew Ba Tran and Faiz Siddiqui report: \u201cAfter the crash, Boeing issued a bulletin disclosing that this line of planes, known as the 737 Max 8, was equipped with a new type of software as part of the plane\u2019s automated functions. Some pilots were furious that they were not told about the new software when the plane was unveiled. Dennis Tajer, a 737 captain who attended the meeting with Boeing executives, recalled, 'They said, \u2018Look, we didn\u2019t include it because we have a lot of people flying on this and we didn\u2019t want to inundate you with information.\u2019 ... Tajer said that the 737 training Boeing offered before the Lion Air crash involved an iPad course that took less than an hour to complete. ...\n\n\u201cThe software, known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS), can in some rare but dangerous situations override pilot control inputs unless it is switched off. This can interfere with pilots\u2019 longtime training that pulling back on the control yoke raises a plane\u2019s nose, putting the plane into a climb. That means that as a pilot tries to maneuver an airplane, the automated system may be counteracting that pilot\u2019s inputs.\u201d\n\n-- After the Ethio\u00adpian crash on Sunday, Boeing said it would update flight-control software, something it might have done sooner if not for the government shutdown. The company and the FAA had been working to hash out the update but it was delayed because of the longest shutdown in U.S. history and differences of opinion, per the Wall Street Journal's Andrew Tangel and Andy Pasztor: \u201cU.S. aviation regulators are expected to mandate the change by the end of April.\u201d\n\nMatthew Whitaker \"did not deny\" talking to Trump about Cohen, according to a House Democrat. (Jonathan Ernst/Reuters)\n\nTHERE'S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:\n\n-- During a closed-door interview with the House Judiciary Committee, former acting attorney general Matt Whitaker \u201cdid not deny\u201d that he and Trump personally discussed the government's case against his former lawyer Michael Cohen, according to Democratic chairman Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.). Karoun Demirjian reports: \u201c\u2018Unlike in the hearing room, Mr. Whitaker did not deny that the president called him to discuss the Michael Cohen case and personnel decisions in the Southern District,\u2019 Nadler said following his meeting with Whitaker on Wednesday, referring to the U.S. attorney\u2019s office for the Southern District of New York, which brought the case against Cohen. \u2026\n\n\u201cAccording to Nadler, Whitaker did not deny that he had been 'directly involved in conversations about whether to fire one or more U.S. attorneys.' He also did not deny that he had been 'involved in conversations about the scope' of U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman\u2019s recusal from the Cohen case, Nadler said, and whether subordinate prosecutors at the Southern District of New York 'went too far' pursuing the campaign finance case in which Cohen has implicated Trump.\n\n\u201cThe committee\u2019s ranking Republican, Rep. Douglas A. Collins (Ga.), who was present for Wednesday\u2019s interview with Whitaker, called Nadler\u2019s summary an 'interpretation' and 'overreach,' while a Republican staff lawyer also present for the meeting said Whitaker simply could not remember ever conversing with Trump about Cohen\u2019s case. \u2026 Wednesday\u2019s meeting was not transcribed, complicating the matter of resolving Nadler\u2019s and Collins\u2019s diverging interpretations of Whitaker\u2019s account. But Whitaker\u2019s non-denials are raising questions among Trump\u2019s critics about whether his public testimony was accurate.\u201d\n\n-- Paul Manafort was sentenced to a total of nearly eight years in prison for conspiracy and fraud. Spencer S. Hsu, Rachel Weiner and Ann E. Marimow: \u201cIn federal court Wednesday, Judge Amy Berman Jackson criticized Manafort and his attorneys for repeatedly casting his hard fall from power as collateral damage from the special counsel\u2019s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign. \u2026 For Manafort\u2019s crimes of illegally lobbying in Ukraine and hiding the proceeds overseas, then encouraging witnesses to lie on his behalf, Jackson\u2019s terms added 43 months to the 47 months he received in Alexandria federal court last week for bank and tax fraud. Her total sentence was 73 months in the D.C. case, but Jackson said 30 of those would overlap with the tally in Virginia. \u2026 Asked if he would pardon Manafort, Trump said, \u2018I have not even given it a thought, as of this moment. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s right now on my mind.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Just minutes after Jackson handed down the sentence, a New York grand jury indicted Manafort on charges of residential mortgage fraud \u2014 charges that fall outside Trump\u2019s pardon power. Devlin Barrett and Matt Zapotosky report: \u201cUnder the Constitution, presidents have wide authority to pardon, but that power applies only to federal convictions, not state cases. \u2026 New York State Attorney General Letitia James has urged the legislature to fix what Democrats call a \u2018double-jeopardy loophole\u2019 in state law that could negate New York\u2019s ability to prosecute anyone pardoned by the president. \u2026 New York lawmakers were working this week to undo the pardon loophole. \u2026 The state charges could be challenged in the courts as a violation of double jeopardy protections for defendants, an area in which current New York law may favor Manafort.\u201d\n\nAll told, Manafort will probably wind up serving about 6.5 years. He gets credit for the nine months he's already spent in jail. (Tom Jackman)\n\nHe gets credit for the nine months he's already spent in jail.

NPR\u2019s Carrie Johnson reports: \u201cAndrew Weissmann, the architect of the case against Manafort, will study and teach at New York University and work on a variety of public service projects, including his longstanding interest in preventing wrongful convictions by shoring up forensic science standards used in courts.\u201d\n\n-- Introducing a new character in this saga: Robert Costello, a New York lawyer with connections to Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani, told Michael Cohen in an April 2018 email that he could \u201csleep well tonight\u201d because he had \u201cfriends in high places\u201d \u2014 though he did not specifically mention a possible pardon from the president, CNN\u2019s Gloria Borger and Jeremy Herb report: \u201cCohen, in his closed-door congressional testimony, has provided these emails in an effort to corroborate his claim that a pardon was dangled before he decided to cooperate with federal prosecutors, according to sources familiar with his testimony. \u2026 But the attorney who wrote those emails, Robert Costello, told CNN that Cohen's interpretation of events is \u2018utter nonsense.\u2019 Costello said that Cohen asked him to raise the issue of a pardon with Giuliani.\u201d\n\n-- Costello said he's preparing to deliver all the emails to federal prosecutors at the U.S. attorney's office, which requested them after CNN's story. Colby Itkowitz and Matt Zapotosky report: Costello \u201caccused Cohen or his lawyer of having \u2018selectively\u2019 leaked copies of their email exchanges \u2018to bolster the false narrative that they originally tried to peddle in the media last week.\u2019 \u2026 \u2018This statement: \u2018Sleep Well tonight, you have friends in high places\u2019 was a tongue-in-cheek reference to a Garth Brooks song, to a client whose state of mind was highly disturbed and had suggested to us that he was suicidal. We were simply trying to be decent human beings. There is no hidden message,\u2019 Costello said.\n\n-- Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) rejected calls from House Republicans for an investigation into whether Cohen lied to Congress during his testimony two weeks ago. The Oversight chairman, however, left open the possibility of further action against Trump\u2019s former lawyer if new evidence of perjury is uncovered.\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement officers have been tapping into a privately maintained database of license plates. (Marlon Correa/The Washington Post)\n\nTHE REST OF THE AGENDA:\n\n-- Immigration agents have been tapping into a vast and privately maintained database of license plate numbers gathered from vehicles across the nation to track immigrants who may be in the United States illegally. Drew Harwell and Tony Romm report: \u201cThe records the ACLU obtained from the Department of Homeland Security through a Freedom of Information Act request shed new light on a little-noticed and expanding network of surveillance that has developed over the years and for which there appear to be few legal limitations. \u2026 Immigration and Customs Enforcement\u2019s use of some of the information in states including California also appears to skirt limitations that \u2018sanctuary cities\u2019 have placed on police cooperation with the immigration agency, the ACLU said. \u2026 ICE spokesman Matthew Bourke said that agents use the license-plate database as a tool to help in its immigration-enforcement investigations and that it does not use the information to track people \u2018who have no connection to ICE investigatory or enforcement activities.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- For its upcoming mission to the moon, NASA is considering using commercial alternatives instead of the long-delayed rocket it\u2019s been working on for years.

William Booth, Karla Adam and Michael Birnbaum report: \u201cThe no-deal votes were in many ways symbolic \u2014 taking the temperature of Parliament, rather than setting concrete policy. \u2026 [Prime Minister Theresa] May said her government could ask the E.U. for a short extension to implement a deal if it passed by next week.

But Trump withdrew from the treaty on Feb. 1 and triggered a formal six-month wait period before the final expiry of the agreement this summer. \u2026 Washington has said Moscow is already deploying a missile that violates the agreement and cited that weapon as a reason for its withdrawal from the pact.

Kareem Fahim reports: \u201cMany of the women have been tortured while in custody, according to relatives and human rights groups. Saudi officials deny those allegations. \u2026 ALQST, a Saudi rights group based in London, said Wednesday that the women are being charged under the country\u2019s Cyber Crime law with offenses related to their activism, including contacting human rights groups. The charges carry sentences of up to five years in prison.\u201d\n\n-- This \u201csham trial\u201d exposes Saudi Arabia\u2019s disrespect for its citizens, writes Hala Al-Dosari, a Saudi activist and scholar and The Washington Post\u2019s first Jamal Khashoggi fellow: \u201cThe women have been subjected to horrific torture and sexual harassment, but in a statement the government claimed the accused were enjoying their full rights. Meanwhile, state-linked social media accounts have already virtually convicted the activists and are asking for the maximum punishment. ... Against this background, Saudi Arabia decided to appoint its first female ambassador to the United States, Princess Reema bint Bandar. It\u2019s another opportunity to push an apologetic reform narrative amid U.S. congressional scrutiny and pressure. Many will take the bait, as they did when Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman first came to power.

(Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nGET TO KNOW HOWARD SCHULTZ:\n\n-- Billionaire Howard Schultz often talks at length about his experience growing up as in a Brooklyn public housing building, describing it as \u201clow-income\u201d housing where fights \u201cdidn\u2019t typically escalate to deadly violence, but they were tough in their own way.\u201d But his description of Bayview as a rough, low-income community doesn\u2019t match the city\u2019s definition of the project. Marc Fisher reports: \u201c\u2018It was a shiny, wonderful world,\u2019 said former Bayview resident Elyse Maltz, one of many residents of the development who contend that Schultz, 65, has distorted the reality of the place where they grew up in the 1950s and \u201960s. \u2018Everything was brand spanking new.\u2019 Maltz ... [said Bayview] \u2018was middle-class, not lower middle. You were interviewed to get in. My family was pretty well off. I know Howard wants to look like he\u2019s rags to riches, but we had a wonderful, plentiful life. I mean, my ma had a cleaning lady. We really didn\u2019t lack for anything.\u2019 \u2026\n\n\u201cIn 1956, the New York City Housing Authority opened Bayview as a \u2018moderate income\u2019 development, built a block away from Jamaica Bay \u2026 Superficially, Bayview looked much like any city housing development, a collection of brick towers with balky stainless-steel elevators and hallways of green linoleum floors and glazed, aqua-tiled walls. But Bayview, which Schultz\u2019s family moved into in its opening year, was built as a \u2018no cash subsidy\u2019 project, according to city records. That meant that unlike developments subsidized by the federal or state government, Bayview had minimum income requirements for tenants, charged higher rents intended to cover the entire cost of its mortgage, and was \u2018built to high standards compared to [federal] projects,\u2019 according to \u2018Affordable Housing in New York,\u2019 a history of public housing in the city.\u201d\n\n-- In a speech to Miami Dade College detailing how he would run the government, Schultz vowed that he would not sign bills that aren\u2019t passed with bipartisan support and said he will nominate only Supreme Court justices who could be confirmed by two-thirds of the Senate \u2014 a naive statement for anyone who has been watching the judicial wars. Michael Scherer reports: \u201c\u2018The courts have become yet another battlefield in the ongoing war between Democratic and Republican leaders,\u2019 Schultz said. \u2018These battles have undermined our faith in the rule of law and the impartiality of the entire judicial system. All of this has to change.\u2019 He said he would fill his cabinet with Democrats, Republicans and Independents, including \u2018a greater share of women than any previous president.\u2019 \u2026 He promised to work to end the practice of partisan gerrymandering, drawing legislative and congressional districts to preserve one party\u2019s power. That process is controlled by the states, not Washington, but Schultz said he would push for independent commissions to draw those districts in the future.\u201d\n\n-- Big Democratic donors are sending their money to four key states: Michigan, Wisconsin, Florida and Pennsylvania.

In prior years, lobbyists and consultants felt compelled to work officials in all corners of the federal bureaucracy when trying to shape policy. But now, with decision-making consolidated inside the Oval Office, they\u2019ve had to rewrite their playbook. \u2018It\u2019s two different worlds,\u2019 says Eric Bovim, a managing director of Signal Group, a public-affairs agency in Washington. \u2018Under President Obama, the government was a finely tuned instrument, all the parts working together to produce a single note. You needed to work with everybody to calibrate the sound. Today, for the most part, it\u2019s a one-man band, the President in a never-ending guitar solo on the White House lawn, overpowering all the other instruments.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- New York Times, \u201cInside the Pricey, Totally Legal World of College Consultants,\u201d by Dana Goldstein and Jack Healy: \u201cThe government\u2019s indictments of dozens of parents, college administrators and coaches exposed an ugly array of corrupt and illegal admissions practices. But there is also a perfectly legal world of gaming the college admissions process by doing everything from picking advanced classes, choosing the right sport, giving donations and turning to the multibillion-dollar industry of test prep, college essay editing and advice on how to produce the perfect application. Every aspect of a teenager\u2019s life can be managed and shaped into a persona catered to please the exacting eye of a college admissions officer. Parents might pay $300 for a standard, hourlong consultation with an admissions expert or donate tens of millions to schools, with the hope of winning special consideration for their child\u2019s bid for a spot at a top school.\u201d\n\n-- The Atlantic, \u201cAn Abandoned Baby\u2019s DNA Condemns His Mother,\u201d by Sarah Zhang: \u201cThirty-eight years ago, an infant boy \u2014 hours old, tears frozen on his face \u2014 was found dead in a ditch in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. Last week, police arrested his mother and charged her with murder, after investigators uploaded the baby\u2019s DNA to a genealogy website and matched her relatives. \u2026 Currently, no laws limit when police can use genealogy databases to catch criminals.\u201d\n\n-- Cosmopolitan, \u201cInside Denver\u2019s International Church of Cannabis,\u201d by Jen Doll: \u201cToday\u2019s pot parishioners can already be found all over the country, at the Coachella Valley Church in San Jose, the First Cannabis Church of Florida, the First Cannabis Church of Logic and Reason in Michigan, Greenfaith Ministry in Nunn, Colorado, and the First Church of Cannabis in Indianapolis. Many of these groups meet online or on private property, rather than in actual churches, since they\u2019re limited by local laws about public consumption. The International Church of Cannabis is the rare one where you can actually smoke in the church itself, provided you\u2019re at least 21, show ID at the door, and have completed the aforementioned online questionnaire. (Becoming a \u2018member\u2019 is what makes consumption here legal, since the church is a private space.) And you can\u2019t buy or sell on the premises; this is a strictly BYOC situation.\u201d\n\nHOT ON THE LEFT Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) asked Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan why his bank finances the \u201ccaging of children.\u201d Hamza Shaban reports: \u201cDuring Sloan\u2019s appearance before the House Financial Services Committee, which is examining the company\u2019s \u201cpattern of consumer abuses,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez pressed the CEO to explain why his company was financially supporting detention facilities where migrant children were held. 'Why was the bank involved in the caging of children and financing the caging of children to begin with?' she asked, referring to the separation of families at the U.S.-Mexico border under President Trump\u2019s controversial immigration policy. Sloan responded, 'I don\u2019t know how to answer that question, because we weren\u2019t.' ... Sloan acknowledged that Wells Fargo provided financing for two firms that run detention facilities used by the government, with one of those partnerships still active. However, he added, 'I\u2019m not familiar with the specific assertion that you are making, but we weren\u2019t involved with that.'\u201d HOT ON THE RIGHT Jacob Wohl faked death threats against himself. From the Daily Beast's Will Sommer : \u201cWohl\u2019s videos to his fans were premised on the idea that Minneapolis is an incredibly dangerous place ... .

One of those threats came via direct message from a [fake] Twitter account ... one of the fake accounts Wohl created in the run-up to his Twitter ban. ... That means Wohl was sending himself fake death threats, presumably in an attempt to up the drama. ...

    "description": "A Pew study asked people to think about the future.",
    "text": "The sun sets in Tacoma, Wash. (Ted S. Warren/AP)\n\nWith Joanie Greve and Mariana Alfaro\n\nTHE BIG IDEA: Americans, collectively, appear to be in a deeper funk about the future than Beto O\u2019Rourke was after he lost his Senate race.\n\nWhen adults are asked to think about what the United States will be like in 2050, they see the country declining in stature on the world stage, a widening gap between the haves and the have-nots and growing political polarization. They think health care will be less affordable, public education will be lower quality and retiring will be harder.\n\nThey fear the growing national debt, the likelihood of an attack that\u2019s as bad or worse than 9/11 and another 1970s-style energy crisis. Many people also think robots will take their jobs.\n\nFew folks in either party believe the political class is up to the task of addressing the most pressing challenges. Part of the problem is that there is less agreement about what the biggest problems even are than there once was, let alone the best ways to tackle them.\n\nA Pew Research Center study published Thursday is full of sobering data points that underscore the level of unease in the body politic and help explain why every two years brings another change election. The comprehensive poll, released with a 58-page report, paints a grim portrait of Americans who feel trepidation about the day-to-day lives that they and their children will be forced to live in 30 years. The numbers bear out what I\u2019ve heard for years now from voters across the country and across the ideological spectrum.\n\nSeven in 10 Americans are dissatisfied with the way things are going in the country right now, higher than at any time in the past year, but there is a more atmospheric crisis of confidence that transcends the daily news cycle or even the Trump presidency. Overall, 56 percent of people say they are somewhat or even \u201cvery\u201d optimistic about the future while 44 percent say they are pessimistic. But asking specific questions reveals a deeper, more systemic anxiety.\n\n-- The economy: We\u2019re a decade removed from the Great Recession, yet 62 percent of Americans expect the lower class will increase as a relative share of the U.S. population by 2050. Only 20 percent expect that average families will fare better financially in the future than they do today. Another 44 percent predict that their standard of living to be worse three decades from now.\n\nThe poll shows that 73 percent expect the gap between the rich and the poor to grow, including majorities across demographic and political groups. Overall, 54 percent predict that the U.S. economy as a whole will be weaker in 2050 than it is today. And 63 percent worry the national debt will be larger in 2050 than it is now.\n\nThese numbers are startling considering the relative strength of the economy. If people are this pessimistic when times are pretty good, what\u2019s going to happen as this economy continues to slow and inevitably dips into a recession?\n\nWorkers rally outside the GM Lordstown plant this month in Ohio.

(Jeff Swensen/Getty Images)\n\n-- People fear the future of work: 37 percent of all currently employed Americans see automation as a direct threat to their current occupation. Exactly half of workers with no more than a high school diploma think robots and computers will take over the work that they currently do. While many of the highly educated and affluent think artificial intelligence and automation are great, a majority of Americans believe that it will worsen inequality. They don\u2019t see the advantages.\n\n-- There\u2019s growing anxiety about retirement security: Among those who are currently in the workforce, 42 percent expect to receive no Social Security benefits when they eventually retire. Another 42 percent anticipate that benefits will be reduced from what they are today.\n\nOverall, 3 in 4 Americans expect older adults will be less prepared financially for retirement in 2050 than they are today; 83 percent predict that most people will have to work into their 70s to be able to afford to stop working; and 57 percent think people over 65 will have a worse standard of living in 2050 than they do today.\n\n-- More expect the quality of public schools to get worse than better by 2050, and 77 percent of Americans worry about their ability to provide a quality education for the students of tomorrow. This concern is shared across party lines.\n\n-- Six in 10 Americans predict that health care will be less affordable in 2050 than it is today.\n\n-- The same share of people thinks the condition of the planet will be worse in 2050. Only 16 percent think the environment will be better. Meanwhile, 2 in 3 Americans predict a major worldwide energy crisis that will hamper our economy sometime in the next 30 years.\n\nA Black Lives Matter demonstrator waves a flag on the Edmund Pettus Bridge on March 3 during the Bloody Sunday commemoration in Selma, Ala. (Julie Bennett/AP)\n\n-- About half of Americans believe that a majority nonwhite population will lead to more racial and ethnic conflicts. Many white people especially fear demographic change. By 2050, the Census Bureau predicts the United States will be a majority-minority country. The Pew poll shows that 35 percent believe that\u2019s good, 23 percent say it will be bad and the rest don\u2019t think it\u2019s good or bad. Overall, 40 percent believe race relations will be worse in 2050 than they are now.\n\n-- Six in 10 Americans believe that the United States will be less important in the world in 2050 than it is now. And 53 percent expect that China definitely or probably will overtake us as the world\u2019s main superpower within the next three decades.\n\n-- There are also deep worries about the future of faith, marriage and family: Overall, 43 percent say they are \u201cvery\u201d worried about the nation\u2019s moral values while another 34 percent are \u201cfairly\u201d worried. Half the country sees religion being less important to American life in 2050. A 46 percent plurality expects that fewer people will have children. And a 53 percent majority thinks people in 2050 will be less likely to get married than they are today. Only 7 percent predict that people will be more likely to marry in the future.\n\n-- That finding comes amid fresh evidence that America is suffering epidemic levels of aloneness. Another major poll published this week, the General Social Survey, shows that just over half of Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 do not have a steady romantic partner. That\u2019s up dramatically from 33 percent in 2004, which was the lowest figure since the question was first posed in 1986, and it\u2019s up from 45 percent in 2016.\n\n\u201cThe shift has helped drive singledom to a record high among the overall public, among whom 35 percent say they have no steady partner,\u201d Lisa Bonos and Emily Guskin report. \u201cThere are several other trends that go along with the increase in young single Americans. Women are having fewer children, and they\u2019re having them later in life. The median age of first marriage is increasing. \u2026 According to the General Social Survey data, 41 percent of Democrats are without a steady partner, compared with only 29 percent of Republicans.\u201d\n\n-- Tribalism alert: Back to the Pew poll, 2 in 3 Americans predict that the country will be more politically divided in 2050 than it is now, including 68 percent of Republicans and 62 percent of Democrats. Only 26 percent of adults think we will be less polarized in 30 years than we are now.\n\nOther surveys have shown similar levels of pessimism about polarization. A Washington Post-University of Maryland poll in 2017 found that 36 percent of Americans were \u201cnot proud\u201d of U.S. democracy, for example, at least twice as many as said this in both 2014 and 1996. That survey also found 71 percent saying they think partisan disagreements have reached a dangerous new normal. Most of this group (39 percent) thought this was the new normal, rather than temporary. Seven in 10 respondents thought divisions in this era are at least as big as during the Vietnam War, including 77 percent of people who were adults in the 1970s.\n\n-- Finally, most Americans don\u2019t think solutions to our problems will come from Washington. In fact, 55 percent in the Pew poll said Washington will have a more negative impact than a positive one. The country continues to be divided over the role of government: Six in 10 fear the government will do too little to solve problems, while 39 percent worry that the feds will be too involved in issues that are better left to businesses and individuals. These people are counting on scientists, entrepreneurs and educators to get us out of the malaise.\n\nWelcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning briefing for decision-makers. Scott Clement contributed to the polling analysis.\n\nSign up to receive the newsletter.\n\nWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\n\nAmerican soldiers wait on the tarmac in Logar province, Afghanistan. (Rahmat Gul/AP)\n\n-- Two U.S. soldiers were killed in Afghanistan on Friday while carrying out operations. Amie Ferris-Rotman and Sayed Salahuddin report from Kabul: \u201cNo more details were provided and their names will not be disclosed until 24 hours after their next of kin are notified, according to Department of Defense policy, but their deaths come as the United States plans to withdraw its 14,000-troop advisory mission in Afghanistan. Trump recently tied the withdrawal to progress being made toward a peaceful settlement aimed at ending the 18-year war. Despite the peace talks, Afghanistan is suffering from crippling violence, with a record number of civilian casualties last year. On Thursday, a string of bombs exploded in Kabul as Afghans celebrated the Persian New Year, Nowruz, killing six and wounding 23 more.\u201d\n\n-- South Korea said North Korea is pulling out of a liaison office that was meant to facilitate closer communications between the two neighbors. Min Joo Kim reports: \u201cNorth Korean staff members at the office withdrew early Friday on \u2018instructions from the superior authority,\u2019 according to South Korea\u2019s Unification Ministry. The liaison office opened last September in the city of Kaesong just north of the border between the two Koreas to foster closer bilateral ties. North Korean leader Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in reached an agreement to open the office after their historic summit meeting in April. The surprise withdrawal sends a chill through Moon\u2019s efforts for rapprochement with North Korea.\u201d\n\n-- European leaders allowed Britain a short extension on leaving the E.U. but demanded that Prime Minister Theresa May come up with a solution to the parliamentary impasse by April 12. Michael Birnbaum, William Booth and Quentin Ari\u00e8s report: \u201cMay had promised the British people that Brexit would help them take back control from Europe. Instead, she found that her 27 fellow E.U. leaders took back decision-making from her, dictating a political calendar for the coming weeks that gives both sides time to prepare for the worst-case scenario. If British lawmakers approve a divorce deal they have twice rejected, they can leave the European Union on May 22. If they reject it, they must plan an alternative by April 12 or fall off the same no-deal cliff that evening. Either way, the decisions will be forced earlier than the three-month delay May was seeking in Brussels.\u201d\n\n-- A petition to keep Britain in the European Union attracted so much interest that it crashed the Parliament\u2019s website. Those attempting to sign the petition, which has already attracted more than a million signatures, received a message that the Web page was \u201cdown for maintenance.\u201d The technical issues raised suspicions among some Brexit opponents, who encouraged others on social media to keep up efforts to add their names to the petition. (Jennifer Hassan)\n\n-- In an op-ed for The Washington Post, Jennie Willoughby eviscerates the Wall Street Journal for running a piece by Rob Porter, her ex-husband who she says physically abused her and has never apologized for it. His first wife also accused Trump's former White House staff secretary of spousal abuse. Porter has denied the allegations. She writes: \u201cI don\u2019t believe Rob should be forever barred from using his considerable professional skills and knowledge to make a contribution to our society. But Rob\u2019s sudden return to the public eye is deeply troubling to me, because he has yet to candidly address the thing that should \u2014 that must \u2014 come first: his personal conduct during his two marriages. Rob has yet to publicly show regret or contrition for his actions. Giving him a voice before he has done that critical work elevates his opinions above my and [his first wife] Colbie\u2019s dignity. \u2026 We all crave a redemption story. We want to see people take ownership of their inadequacies and sins because we want to believe we, too, can be redeemed for our own. But true redemption is not a given. It is earned.\u201d\n\nCesar Sayoc is shown in a November courtroom sketch. (Elizabeth Williams/AP)\n\nGET SMART FAST:\u200b\u200b\n\nCesar Sayoc pleaded guilty to mailing explosive devices to more than a dozen Trump critics, including Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. The Florida man appeared in a Manhattan courtroom to plead guilty to 65 counts and read a short statement, in which he said he was \u201cextremely sorry\u201d for his actions.

(Jason Samenow) Mississippi's governor signed into law one of the strictest abortion bans in the country, banning the procedure after a doctor can detect a fetal heartbeat during an ultrasound. Heartbeats can be heard just six weeks into a pregnancy, before some women even know they\u2019re pregnant. Antiabortion groups hope that Brett Kavanaugh's elevation to the Supreme Court will pave the way for Roe v. Wade to be overturned. (Reis Thebault) A Wisconsin judge temporarily blocked several elements of the GOP power grab to limit the power of the Democrat who defeated Scott Walker as governor. Dane County Judge Richard Niess invalidated the legislature\u2019s lame-duck actions, including 82 of Scott Walker\u2019s appointments, ruling that the \u201cextraordinary session\u201d during which they were passed was unconstitutional. Republicans in the legislature will appeal. (Fred Barbash) A blast at a chemical factory killed at least 47 and injured more than 600 in eastern China.

(Ashley Halsey III)\n\nTHE IMMIGRATION WARS:\n\n-- The commandant of the Marine Corps warned in leaked memos that Trump's deployments of troops to the southern border and diversions of money from the military's budget pose an \u201cunacceptable risk to Marine Corps combat readiness and solvency.\u201d The Los Angeles Times\u2019s Molly O'Toole scoops: \u201cMarine Corps Gen. Robert Neller said the \u2018unplanned/unbudgeted\u2019 deployment along the border that [Trump] ordered last fall, and shifts of other funds to support border security, had forced him to cancel or reduce planned military training in at least five countries, and delay urgent repairs at bases. \u2026 He complained about canceling or shrinking the Marines\u2019 participation [in training exercises] \u2018at a time where we are attempting to double down on strengthening alliances and attracting new partners.\u2019 While the armed services chiefs often warn of budget shortfalls, independent experts who reviewed Neller\u2019s memos described the language as unusually strong, in particular because it cites the president\u2019s highest-profile political priorities.\u201d\n\n-- The Trump administration\u2019s plans to take money away from military construction projects to pay for the border wall would potentially deal an outsized blow to Puerto Rico and undermine a program that is helping European allies project strength against Vladimir Putin and his revanchist Russia. Paul Sonne and Erica Werner have a sophisticated analysis: \u201cUnder pressure from lawmakers, the Defense Department released a list Monday detailing $12.9 billion in military construction projects that had received money from Congress but had yet to be contracted. \u2026 The Pentagon hasn\u2019t said which specific projects would be defunded. But it has ruled out taking money from military housing projects or contracts due to award before the end of the fiscal year. When those are stripped out, the refined list decreases to $4.35 billion worth of projects that are actually vulnerable. The Trump administration plans to take up to $3.6 billion, or 83 percent, for the wall, meaning most of the projects on the shorter list face could be defunded.\u201d\n\nOn the most-vulnerable list is some $745 million worth of projects for the European Deterrence Initiative, which was launched in 2014 to help shore up the defenses of our European allies after Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine: \u201cThe 23 European projects in the program at risk are aimed at making it easier for allied forces to respond to any Russian military actions in Europe. ... The initiatives at risk include a plan to build a facility for Special Operations forces and their training in Estonia; projects to construct ammunition and fuel storage facilities and staging areas in Poland; and planned upgrades to aircraft surveillance facilities in Italy and Britain, as well as airfield and fuel storage upgrades in Slovakia and Hungary.\u201d\n\nPuerto Rico is the most affected U.S. territory or state, with 10 projects at a value of $403 million on the smaller list. Here are the others that stand to lose the most under Trump\u2019s plan. Note that only three of the top 10 are red states:\n\n-- The law of unintended consequences: Trump\u2019s fixation on securing the border has caused more attempts by migrants to reach U.S. soil by sea. Dan Lamothe reports: \u201cThe migrants enter in various ways, including on personal watercraft and small, open-top motorboats known as pangas that often arrive under cover of darkness, said Jeremy Thompson, [CBP\u2019s] director of marine operations in San Diego. \u2026 Chief Patrol Agent Rodney S. Scott, who oversees CBP operations in San Diego, said that he expects smugglers to adjust their tactics as U.S. officials alter theirs, and he believes that the United States is taking away most of the \u2018low-risk ways\u2019 to get into the country.\u201d\n\n-- The rising rate of apprehensions at the border is complicating Democratic messaging against Trump\u2019s declaration. Democrats have previously pointed to the low apprehension numbers to deride Trump\u2019s immigration proposals, but the latest surge of migrants has robbed them of a favorite talking point. David Nakamura reports: \u201cOver the first five months of fiscal 2019, CBP had apprehended 268,044 migrants, on pace for more than 643,300 this year. If reached, that total would be the most since 705,005 in 2008 and more than twice as high as the 310,531 migrants taken into custody two years ago. Trump and his supporters have been quick to use the new data to try to heighten tensions about threats at the border and paint Democrats as indifferent to an issue the president plans to make a central issue of his reelection campaign.\u201d\n\n-- But, but, but: The climbing numbers are largely fueled by migrant families who are reaching U.S. soil and seeking asylum, a problem that would not be addressed by a wall. Nick Miroff and Karly Domb Sadof report: \u201c[One] group of 127 Guatemalan migrants had waded through the river to turn themselves in to U.S. agents, the first step in initiating the asylum process. They crossed the border illegally, but they have the legal right to seek asylum because they reached U.S. soil. Border Patrol agents must take them into custody and begin processing their claims. \u2026 [I]n private, [Homeland Security officials] acknowledge that the migration surge is likely to continue with or without a wall, and they fear it possibly could accelerate without changes to the U.S. asylum system.\u201d\n\n-- Federal agents set a record for the number arrests of undocumented immigrants with no criminal records who are already in the country. Earlier in his presidency, Trump ordered ICE agents to arrest all undocumented immigrants they encounter, no matter their criminal record. \u201cThat has led to a consistent drop in the percentage of people arrested by ICE who have a criminal record,\u201d USA Today's Alan Gomez reports. \u201cAccording to data released Thursday, that percentage fell to 63.5 percent in December, the lowest monthly figure since ICE started categorizing arrests in 2012. That means 36.5 percent of the arrests were simply undocumented with no criminal history.\u201d\n\n-- One of Rupert Murdoch's former senior executives said he quit his job in 2017 over Fox News's coverage of Muslims, immigrants and race. Former News Corp. Senior Vice President Joseph Azam said he was \u201cfundamentally\u201d bothered by the coverage aired by Fox and other Murdoch news outlets.

(Mulugeta Ayene/AP)\n\nTHE UNFRIENDLY SKIES:\n\n-- Indonesia\u2019s Garuda Airlines canceled an order for 49 Boeing 737 Max jets. This is believed to be the first order cancellation in reaction to the crashes. (Stanley Widianto and Timothy McLaughlin)\n\n-- The jets that went down in Indonesia and Ethiopia lacked two safety features that Boeing charges extra for. It is not uncommon for companies like Boeing to charge extra for plane upgrades, but while some of those add-ons are aesthetic, some of them can affect a jet\u2019s navigation and communication systems. Following the deadly crashes, Boeing intends to make one of the safety features a standard part of its fixes to make planes operable again. (New York Times)\n\n\u00ad-- More families of the Indonesia victims are suing Boeing, claiming the plane involved in October's crash was \u201cdefective and unreasonably dangerous.\u201d More than 30 relatives of the 189 victims have sued Boeing in its hometown of Chicago, and more lawsuits are expected, including from the families of the Ethiopia victims. (Luz Lazo)\n\n-- Two pilots filed FAA complaints about Ethiopian Airlines\u2019 safety procedures years before this month's crash. Aaron Gregg reports: \u201cThe 2015 complaints, filed before the Max 8 was in use, are critical of training and pilot documentation on the 737 in use at the time, as well as two larger Boeing planes. They could also lead to renewed scrutiny of Ethiopian Airlines, a fast-growing international airline that has enjoyed a generally positive safety reputation in international aviation circles. One pilot said the airline didn\u2019t \u2018have the infrastructure\u2019 to support the fleet of Boeing and Airbus jets it ordered, and alleged the airline had a \u2018fear-based\u2019 management culture in which \u2018safety is being sacrificed for expansion and profit margin.\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump gave Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's reelection campaign a boost after he said he supports Israel's control of Golan Heights. (Menahem Kahana/AFP/Getty)\n\nTRUMP TIPS THE SCALES FOR BIBI:\n\n-- Continuing his penchant for making major foreign policy announcements via tweet, the president endorsed permanent Israeli control of the disputed Golan Heights, saying the area is of \u201ccritical\u201d importance to Israel. Anne Gearan, Loveday Morris and Carol Morello report: \u201cThe position is a political boon to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu days before he is scheduled to visit Washington and three weeks before he faces an unexpectedly difficult reelection vote at home. \u2026 Trump\u2019s statement marks an important symbolic reversal of official U.S. neutrality on an issue that is akin to Israel\u2019s occupation of the West Bank, which was also seized during the 1967 war and is claimed by Palestinians for a future independent state. \u2026 Trump decided to announce the new position despite concerns among some in his administration that it would put a finger on the scale of Netanyahu\u2019s election.\u201d\n\n-- Trump\u2019s endorsement came as a shock to members of his own Middle East peace team, the State Department and Israeli officials. \u201cWe all found out by tweet,\u201d one Israeli official said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been lobbying for this for a long time, but it was not the product of one phone call. There were hints, but we weren\u2019t given advance notice.\u201d (McClatchy)\n\n-- Democrats are wrestling over their support for Israel as members of the party stand accused of anti-Semitism, and Trump upends decades of bipartisan consensus by endorsing Netanyahu\u2019s right-wing priorities. Mike DeBonis, Sean Sullivan and Rachael Bade report: \u201cFew Democratic leaders believe the party is in danger of seeing a mass defection of Jewish voters \u2014 a \u2018Jexodus\u2019 some Republicans are calling for, including Trump \u2014 but many say they need to redouble their efforts to police anti-Semitic rhetoric and prevent further erosion of support for Israel. Jewish voters typically favor Democrats over Republicans by a remarkably consistent ratio of 2 to 1 or better, according to exit polling dating to 1980. \u2026 That mission is set to play out next week as thousands of politically active Jewish Americans and allies gather at the annual American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) Policy Conference,\u201d with headliners that include Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.).\n\n-- The latest litmus test from the far left: Several Democratic presidential candidates have announced that they intend to skip the AIPAC conference, bowing to pressure from the liberal group MoveOn.org. Bernie Sanders, Beto O\u2019Rourke, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg and Juli\u00e1n Castro all said they would skip the summit. Even Howard Schultz says he won't participate. (NBC News)\n\n-- One way House Democrats are attempting to show that their party still supports Israel after the Ilhan Omar donnybrook is by introducing a bipartisan resolution rebuking the global boycott movement against Israel. Rachael Bade and Mike DeBonis report: \u201cHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (N.Y.) and Rep. Bradley Schneider (Ill.) joined with two Republicans to introduce the resolution Thursday. It expresses opposition to any efforts to 'delegitimize' Israel, including the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement. \u2026 The resolution also reaffirms the need for a two-state solution to the decades-long conflict in the Middle East. Many supporters of the BDS movement back a one-state solution combining both Israel and Palestinian territories, which opponents say would upend the existence of a Jewish state. House Democratic leadership has yet to schedule a vote on the legislation, but the sponsors of the measure have talked to leadership amid a quiet push for a vote.\u201d\n\nWhite House senior adviser Jared Kushner attends a Cabinet meeting at the White House. (Evan Vucci/AP)\n\nTHERE\u2019S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:\n\n-- House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) said Jared Kushner\u2019s lawyer told him that the White House adviser and presidential son-in-law uses WhatsApp for official business communications. Tom Hamburger and Josh Dawsey report: \u201cCummings described the Dec. 19 discussion with Kushner lawyer Abbe Lowell in a letter to the White House counsel in which he requested information about the use of such messaging apps and other communications by White House personnel. Lowell challenged aspects of Cummings\u2019s account, writing in his own letter that he did not say that Kushner used WhatsApp to communicate with foreign leaders. He also said he told Cummings and then-House Oversight Chairman Trey Gowdy, who was also in the December meeting, that he was not familiar with the details of Kushner\u2019s use of the messaging application and referred them to the White House counsel.\n\n\u201cThe use of messaging services such as WhatsApp could run afoul of White House policy and the Presidential Records Act, which prohibits White House officials from sending a record \u2018using a nonofficial electronic message account\u2019 unless the messages are copied to an official account within 20 days. \u2026 According to Cummings\u2019s letter, Lowell said during their December meeting that Kushner was in compliance with records preservations rules because he took screen shots of his communications and forwarded them to his official email or to National Security Council officials. \u2026 Cummings said Lowell also told him in their December meeting that Kushner\u2019s wife, presidential adviser Ivanka Trump, was continuing to receive emails related to White House business on her private email account and did not always forward them to her White House account.\u201d\n\n-- A 12-page letter from Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to a Republican senator may offer some insight into what Mueller\u2019s final report might look like. ABC News\u2019s Jonathan Karl reports: \u201cThe bottom line: Do not expect a harsh condemnation of Trump or any of his associates if they have not been charged with crimes. \u2026 In the letter, Rosenstein makes it clear he believes the Department of Justice will not \u2014 and cannot without violating long-standing Department of Justice policy \u2014 include disparaging or incriminating information about anybody who has not been charged with a crime. \u2026 If Mueller follows the guidance of the man who appointed him and supervised his investigation, he cannot publicly disparage those who have not been charged with a crime. Rosenstein is emphatic on this point: \u2018In fact, disclosing uncharged allegations against American citizens without a law-enforcement need is considered to be a violation of a prosecutor's trust.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Former FBI director Jim Comey writes in a New York Times op-ed that he hopes special counsel Bob Mueller\u2019s report serves as an example of the resilience of the U.S. justice system. Comey writes: \u201cEven though I believe Mr. Trump is morally unfit to be president of the United States, I\u2019m not rooting for Mr. Mueller to demonstrate that he is a criminal. I\u2019m also not rooting for Mr. Mueller to 'clear' the president. I\u2019m not rooting for anything at all, except that the special counsel be permitted to finish his work, charge whatever cases warrant charging and report on his work. \u2026 I care only that the work be done, well and completely. If it is, justice will have prevailed and core American values will have been protected at a time when so much of our national leadership has abandoned its commitment to truth and the rule of law.\u201d\n\nComey says he hopes Congress does not try to impeach Trump: \u201cI don\u2019t mean that Congress shouldn\u2019t move ahead with the process of impeachment governed by our Constitution, if Congress thinks the provable facts are there. I just hope it doesn\u2019t. Because if Mr. Trump were removed from office by Congress, a significant portion of this country would see this as a coup, and it would drive those people farther from the common center of American life, more deeply fracturing our country.\u201d\n\n-- Former attorney general Jeff Sessions returned to the Justice Department to literally claim back his old chair. Matt Zapotosky reports: As part of a DOJ tradition, Sessions was presented with the brown leather chair he once sat on when he led the department. \u201cIn a gray suit and a red tie, Sessions sat at the head of the Justice Department\u2019s Great Hall, next to William P. Barr, the man Trump picked to replace Sessions. \u2026 The moment was one that Sessions missed when he was in the department \u2014 and that some of his supporters thought was overdue. \u2026 Sometimes attorneys general even get a lavish goodbye. At Eric H. Holder Jr.\u2019s send-off, soul legend Aretha Franklin gave a surprise performance, and President Barack Obama cried. Sessions, by contrast, was forced out in a day. \u2026 Trump did not attend the ceremony Thursday, but his presence was felt.\u201d\n\nTRUMP'S DOMESTIC AGENDA:\n\n-- Waging war on states' rights as he seeks to increase oil and gas drilling, Trump is laying the groundwork to weaken a federal law that empowers California and other coastal states to slow down offshore development in federal waters. The Los Angeles Times\u2019s Anna M. Phillips and Rosanna Xia report: \u201cAmong other things, the administration appears to be considering limits to the scope of states\u2019 review powers and a shorter period of time to process an appeal. The full extent of its plans is unclear. The goal, officials wrote, is to provide \u2018greater efficiency and predictability\u2019 for oil and gas projects \u2014 language often used to justify deregulation. The oil industry cheered the administration\u2019s move. ... 'Republicans are always supposed to be in favor of states\u2019 rights,\u2019 said Richard Charter, who has worked on oil issues for 40 years and is a senior fellow at the marine conservation nonprofit Ocean Foundation. \u2018But this is in fact an effort to take away states\u2019 rights when it comes to offshore drilling.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie is moving quickly to roll out new rules that would allow more veterans to get their health care from the private sector. Lisa Rein reports: \u201cFor Trump, giving veterans more choices will probably be a reelection theme next year as he seeks shorter waits and potentially better care for veterans, a crucial constituency. Democrats now in charge in the House are resisting. They say proposed rules on when veterans could go outside VA are too lenient and would damage the government system \u2014 a long-held fear of Democrats who worry that union jobs will be siphoned off and the government system dismantled.\u201d\n\n-- The bully pulpit works: After days of criticism from Trump over Twitter, GM will announce a $300 million investment at its Orion Assembly Plant in Michigan. Heather Long and Josh Dawsey report: \u201cTrump has berated the company all week for shutting a factory in Ohio, and the announcement is in part driven by an effort to appease the president, according to [two people familiar with the matter].\u201d\n\nTrump called GM CEO Mary Barra on Sunday and demanded that she reopen the Lordstown factory in Ohio, where 5,400 jobs were lost: \u201cBarra tried to tell Trump that she can\u2019t do anything right away because GM and the [United Automobile Workers union] will enter negotiations later this year over a new union contract. The fate of the Lordstown plant will be part of that discussion. Trump said he \u2018didn\u2019t care at all about the union rules,\u2019 according to the people familiar with the call, and that he wouldn\u2019t be happy with \u2018token\u2019 things. Barra tried to emphasize to Trump that the company has been working to relocate workers at Lordstown to other GM factories across the country. About 800 have transferred, according to the union, but Trump wasn\u2019t satisfied with that, according to people familiar with the conversation.\u201d\n\n-- The president signed an executive order intended to protect freedom of speech on college campuses, surrounded by student activists who have said their conservative views have been silenced at their universities. Susan Svrluga reports: \u201cTrump told the students that people can have different views, \u2018but they have to let you speak.\u2019 The president declared it the first in a number of steps the administration would take to defend students\u2019 rights. Universities have tried to restrict free thought and impose conformity, he said.\u201d\n\n-- The House will vote next week on a measure to reject the president\u2019s ban on transgender people serving openly in the military, which could lead to a new congressional rebuke for the White House. Mike DeBonis report: \u201cThe announcement comes a week after the Pentagon said it would begin enforcing the transgender troop ban for new applicants starting on April 12. \u2026 The House resolution expresses opposition to the presidential order and urges the Pentagon \u2018to maintain an inclusive policy allowing qualified transgender Americans to enlist and serve in the Armed Forces,\u2019 but it would not force the military to change its policy if passed. The measure, authored by Rep. Joe Kennedy (D-Mass.), has 187 co-sponsors, all Democrats.\u201d\n\n-- Trump is considering Heritage Foundation fellow Stephen Moore for the Federal Reserve Board. Bloomberg News\u2019s Saleha Mohsin and Jennifer Jacobs report: \u201cMoore, 59, was the founder of the conservative Club for Growth and served on the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal. He was a senior economist on the Congressional Joint Economic Committee and was an economic analyst for CNN. \u2026 Moore blamed the Fed for slowing the economy while championing Trump\u2019s policies in a March 13 Journal column that he co-authored. He also suggested the Fed stabilize the value of the dollar by adopting a commodity price rule. Also under consideration for the board is Herman Cain, the former pizza company executive who ran for the 2012 Republican presidential nomination.\u201d\n\nFormer vice president Joe Biden speaks during the First State Democratic Dinner in Dover, Del.

The effort was designed to help the party overcome its deficit with Republicans on using voter data to identify supporters and drive turnout. But she decided this week to work for the O'Rourke campaign instead.\u201d\n\n-- Several top Democratic donors, skeptical of whether Joe Biden can win the Democratic nomination, have told the former vice president they won\u2019t help him fundraise in the early stages of his campaign. CNBC\u2019s Brian Schwartz reports: \u201cThe donors told Biden they\u2019re not yet convinced he can overtake the younger, more diverse and progressive field, and that they are going to wait to see how he competes in the race.\u201d\n\n-- Biden is actively weighing options to reassure primary voters about his age, including possibly promising to only serve one term or announcing a younger running mate early on. The New York Times\u2019s Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns report: \u201cSuch moves would amount to a big play that would send a signal about the seriousness of the election, and could potentially appeal to both liberal activists and general-election voters who are eager to chart the safest route toward defeating [Trump]. But Mr. Biden is not sold on either approach, and both carry significant risks, chiefly that they could call further attention to the age of a candidate who would turn 80 in the White House.\u201d\n\n-- Karen Tumulty argues in her column that it would be a bad idea for Stacey Abrams to go along with being Biden's running mate, if he asks.\n\n-- Sen. Michael Bennet, the Colorado Democrat I recently spoke with in New Hampshire, is expected to enter the crowded 2020 field within the next month. One of Bennet\u2019s longtime advisers said a decision had not been finalized, but Democratic sources say they expect him to announce in the coming weeks. The Denver Post\u2019s Nic Garcia reports that Bennet has been weighing a bid since the fall. \u201cHowever, his interest accelerated after he delivered a stinging rebuke of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz on the Senate floor during the partial federal government shutdown. That speech catapulted him into the national spotlight and fueled a trip to Iowa and later New Hampshire to meet with voters before making a final decision on a presidential run.\u201d\n\n-- Economic models are predicting a Trump landslide in 2020, but a faltering economy or additional scandals could tip the scales against him. Politico\u2019s Ben White and Steven Shepard report: \u201cWhile Trump appears to be in a much stronger position than his approval rating and conventional Beltway wisdom might suggest, he also could wind up in trouble if the economy slows markedly between now and next fall, as many analysts predict it will. \u2026 Trump\u2019s party managed to lose the House in 2018 despite a strong economy. So the models could wind up wrong this time around. \u2026 \u2018The economy is just so ... strong right now and by all historic precedent the incumbent should run away with it,\u2019 said Donald Luskin, chief investment officer of TrendMacrolytics, a research firm whose model correctly predicted Trump\u2019s 2016 win when most opinion polls did not. \u2018I just don\u2019t see how the blue wall could resist all that.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie praised his friend, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, saying he has a \u201cvery bright\u201d future in politics. But Christie would not endorse Hogan's potential candidacy for the 2020 GOP nomination, saying a primary against Trump isn't practical. Rachel Chason reports: \u201cChristie said he sees no current path for a successful primary challenge, noting Trump\u2019s strong support with Republican voters. Hogan has repeatedly stated the same.\u201d\n\nTRUMP UNPLUGGED, CONT.:\n\n-- Trump\u2019s relentless and continuing attacks on John McCain, even seven months after the late senator\u2019s death from brain cancer, appeal to many of his base voters. Robert Costa, Josh Dawsey and Seung Min Kim report: \u201cInside the powerful and populist wing of the party that is most loyal to Trump, McCain is not a revered war hero but a useful foil \u2014 encapsulating everything his core voters have come to loathe about establishment Republicans, from their support for the Iraq War to their opposition to Trump\u2019s nativist agenda to their esteem for the Justice Department as it oversees the ongoing Russia investigation. By attacking McCain, Trump allies said Thursday, the president is stoking his supporters\u2019 rawest emotions and suspicions about the GOP\u2019s political elite. \u2026 And there is an audience. On social media, Fox News and other conservative-leaning platforms, Trump\u2019s searing critiques of the late senator are acceptable to many rank-and-rile Republicans.\u201d\n\n-- Arizona Sen. Martha McSally (R) said she spoke with Trump about the attacks against McCain. McSally and fellow Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D) came to McCain's defense after Trump renewed his attacks Wednesday. Of her conversation with Trump, McSally said: \u201cI wanted to make sure he understood how I felt about Sen. McCain and how Arizona felt about Sen. John McCain. And he heard me.\u201d (Politico)\n\n-- Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa), running for reelection, became the latest Republican senator to criticize Trump\u2019s attacks on McCain. She said during a town hall, \u201cI do not appreciate his tweets. \u2026 John McCain is a dear friend of mine. So, no I don\u2019t agree with President Trump and he does need to stop.\u201d (Politico)\n\n-- A spokesman for Washington National Cathedral contradicted Trump\u2019s claim that he had to approve McCain\u2019s funeral arrangements. \u201cAll funerals and memorial services at the Cathedral are organized by the family of the deceased,\u201d a cathedral spokesman said in a statement. \u201cOnly a state funeral for a former president involves consultation with government officials. No funeral at the Cathedral requires the approval of the president or any other government official.\u201d (BuzzFeed News)\n\n-- Joe Lieberman op-ed: \u201cJohn McCain probably wouldn\u2019t have responded to Trump\u2019s comments. As his friend, I will.\u201d\n\nTHE CONWAYS, A REALITY TV SHOW:\n\n-- Top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway said on Fox News that her husband, George Conway, told her she should resign. But she said she has no intention of doing so. John Wagner reports: \u201c\u2019What message would that send to the feminists everywhere who pretend they\u2019re independent thinkers and men don\u2019t make decisions for them?\u2019 Conway said during a morning television appearance. \u2018They can talk it, and I can walk it. I can live it.\u2019 \u2026 Conway told Fox host Maria Bartiromo that Trump continues to be supportive of her. \u2026 Conway said she can \u2018appreciate\u2019 Trump\u2019s efforts to defend himself against her husband. She has been surprised that her husband has chosen to air his concerns about Trump so publicly, she added.\u201d\n\n-- The Conways\u2019 feud has landed the president in the middle of a marital mess, writes Petula Dvorak: \u201cThis devil\u2019s triangle of a married couple and a president has taken one of Washington\u2019s standard story lines \u2014 the madcap misadventures of a mixed marriage \u2014 and twisted it into something unrecognizable, cringey and on display for an audience of millions. \u2026 A mixed marriage is one of those D.C. cultural curiosities, normally a red and blue pairing, a Capulet and a Montague, a fiery, bipartisan union that means every Sunday brunch is their own, private, \u2018Meet the Press\u2019 panel, and it\u2019s passion, not politics, that keeps them together. \u2026 This latest D.C. marriage show \u2014 the triangle of the Conways and Trump \u2014 is dark dysfunction, not lovable sitcom. A twisted reality show that\u2019s appalling to watch.\u201d\n\n-- Is George Conway the Martha Mitchell of our time? The outspoken wife of Richard Nixon\u2019s attorney general John Mitchell was dismissed as \u201ccrazy\u201d for her wild claims about the Nixon administration \u2014 which turned out to be true \u2014 and even issued a public ultimatum to her husband to choose her or the president. Gillian Brockell recalls one of the wildest episodes in modern politics. It\u2019s a good read:\n\n\u201cIn the spring of 1972, John Mitchell resigned as attorney general to become Nixon\u2019s campaign manager for his reelection. And in June, Martha joined her husband in California for several campaign events. It was there, on the night of June 17, that John Mitchell got a call about some arrests made at the Watergate Hotel. \u2026 Mitchell realized that if his wife found out that she knew one of the men arrested, James McCord, she might become upset and tell reporters about it, thus tipping them off to the connection between the burglars and the president. So as he headed back to Washington, he instructed security guards working for the campaign to keep his wife in the dark in California \u2014 and to stop her from calling members of the media. But find out she did, and just as her husband predicted, she soon called UPI\u2019s Helen Thomas. \u2018The conversation ended abruptly when it appeared that somebody had taken the phone from her hand,\u2019 Thomas reported. \u2018She was heard to say, \u2018You just get away.\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cMartha Mitchell later said one of the guards discovered her and ripped the phone from the wall. She was kept in the hotel room for days, she said, where the guard held her down as a doctor injected her with sedatives, her young daughter watching the whole time. \u2018I\u2019m black and blue,\u2019 she told Thomas days later. \u2018I\u2019m a political prisoner.\u2019 \u2026 [T]he man Mitchell accused of roughing her up and \u2018kidnapping\u2019 her, Stephen King, is now Trump\u2019s ambassador to the Czech Republic.)\u201d\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\n\nAll eyes are on Mueller:\n\nRobert Mueller arrives for work in rainy dark this am.

    "title": "The Daily 202: Six revealing quotes that speak volumes about the political moment",
    "description": "From Pelosi to Ryan and Cheney to Carlson, each illustrates a trend of the Trump era.",
    "text": "With Joanie Greve and Mariana Alfaro\n\nTHE BIG IDEA: The United States, so deeply divided, faces profound and pressing problems. Six quotes that came out on Monday, from a range of sources, could be grouped together and put into a time capsule to help future historians make sense of American politics circa 2019.\n\n-- The first is a little-noticed paragraph inside the 150-page budget request that President Trump submitted to Congress on Monday: \u201cEven with high levels of economic growth, excessive deficits continue to threaten the Nation\u2019s progress, and any unforeseen shocks to the economy could make deficits unsustainable,\u201d it says. \u201cIf financial obligations continue to grow at the current pace, the Nation\u2019s creditors may demand higher interest rates to compensate, potentially leading to lower private investment and a smaller capital stock, harming both American businesses and workers.\u201d\n\nThe document warns that deficits are on track to remain over a trillion dollars per year \u201cfor the foreseeable future,\u201d the national debt \u2014 now $22 trillion \u2014 \u201cwill soon surpass a percent of GDP not seen since 1947,\u201d and interest payments alone on the federal government\u2019s debt will double by 2023 and exceed spending on the U.S. military by 2024 \u201cif nothing is done.\u201d\n\nThe White House projects that the government will need to spend $482 billion on interest payments for the debt next year alone. That\u2019s more than the entire budget for Medicaid.\n\nWhat\u2019s remarkable is that there is no evidence of meaningful political will to tackle this potentially existential crisis. Leaders in both parties called the budget dead on arrival.\n\nAlthough the budget proposes \u201cthe \u2018most spending reductions ever sent to Congress,\u2019 as one of Trump\u2019s top aides put it, the deficit is expected to hit $1.1 trillion this year and stay above the trillion mark every year through at least 2022,\u201d economics correspondent Heather Long reports. \u201cThis is unprecedented in good economic times and is occurring because Trump and Congress are spending more at the same time the GOP tax cuts drive down government revenue. (Trump\u2019s budget shows small increases the next few years in tax revenue, but that might be a stretch given what is occurring so far this fiscal year).\u201d\n\nWhat should give Americans heartburn is that even the dire numbers are based on some fantastical \u2014 if not impossible \u2014 assumptions, including that there will not be a recession at any point in the next decade. \u201cNo president likes to predict a downturn, but Trump is being exceptionally rosy in his outlook,\u201d Heather notes. \u201cHis budget predicts about 3 percent growth every year for a decade. In contrast, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office predicts growth of slightly below 2 percent a year. To achieve Trump\u2019s projection, the economy would have to grow at A-plus potential for years with no recessions, something the United States has never achieved before.\u201d\n\nThere are certainly some fiscal hawks who work inside the administration, like acting OMB director Russ Vought and acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, but what matters is who sits in the Oval Office. Trump has called himself the king of debt and argued privately that deficits don\u2019t really matter because they won\u2019t blow up until after he leaves office. He didn\u2019t even mention the issue during his recent State of the Union address.\n\nThere\u2019s a pattern of Republican politicians demanding fiscal responsibility when they\u2019re in the wilderness but then spending like drunken sailors on shore leave when they hold power. It\u2019s happening again. The 2017 GOP tax cuts, which overwhelmingly benefit the richest 1 percent of Americans and the biggest corporations, will add an estimated $1.5 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. With no change in trajectory, the ship of state will continue drifting down a river that ends with a waterfall.\n\nFormer vice president Dick Cheney attends a memorial ceremony for George H.W. Bush at the Capitol in December. (Jonathan Ernst/AP)\n\n2. Dick Cheney: \u201cWe\u2019re getting into a situation when our friends and allies around the world that we depend upon are going to lack confidence in us. \u2026 I worry that the bottom line of that kind of an approach is we have an administration that looks a lot more like Barack Obama than Ronald Reagan.\u201d\n\nThe former vice president uncorked one of the most searing conservative critiques to date of Trump\u2019s foreign policy while conducting a Q&A with Vice President Pence at a donor retreat this weekend sponsored by the American Enterprise Institute. Someone leaked a transcript yesterday of the off-the-record session on Sea Island, Ga.\n\n\u201cCheney respectfully but repeatedly and firmly pressed Pence on a number of the president\u2019s foreign policy moves,\u201d Ashley Parker and Bob Costa report. \u201cHe expressed concerns at such actions as taking a harder line toward U.S. allies in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and deciding to withdraw troops from Syria during what he fretted was \u2018the middle of a phone call.\u2019 \u2026 Cheney expressed alarm over news reports that Trump \u2018supposedly doesn\u2019t spend that much time with the intel people, or doesn\u2019t agree with them, frequently,\u2019 as well as the high staff turnover rate at the intelligence agencies.\n\n\u201cHe worried aloud, again and again, that for Trump, foreign policy boils down to a crude dollars-and-cents transaction. \u2026 He worried about Trump\u2019s decision to cancel the decades-long U.S. military exercises with South Korea and referenced a recent Bloomberg News report about the president\u2019s directive \u2018to pursue a policy that would insist that the Germans, the Japanese, and the South Koreans pay total cost for our deployments there, plus 50 percent on top of that.\u2019 \u2026 \u2018I don\u2019t know, that sounded like a New York state real estate deal to me,\u2019 Cheney quipped.\u201d\n\nPence, unprepared for tough questions, mostly shrugged off Cheney\u2019s concerns and praised Trump as a transformational leader. Reading the transcript shows what a total loyalist Pence has become to Trump. He staked out several positions that are at odds with the posture he took as a congressman and governor.\n\nMoreover, the conversation between the two men who have held the No. 2 job underscored the deep fissures that remain inside the GOP over Trump\u2019s foreign policy. It\u2019s the same tension that led to Jim Mattis\u2019s resignation in December as defense secretary after Trump abruptly announced the complete withdrawal of troops from Syria. The president eventually relented under pressure from hawks on the Hill. Some troops will stay.\n\n3. Nancy Pelosi: \u201cI\u2019m not for impeachment. \u2026 Impeachment is so divisive to the country that unless there\u2019s something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, I don\u2019t think we should go down that path, because it divides the country. And he\u2019s just not worth it.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is news,\u201d the House speaker told our Joe Heim last Wednesday for a story that published yesterday. \u201cI haven\u2019t said this to any press person before. But since you asked, and I\u2019ve been thinking about this.\u201d\n\nThe California Democrat said this knowing that she\u2019d take instant and intense heat from her left flank, which she has, but her goal appears to be protecting vulnerable moderate members who are up for reelection next year in districts that Trump carried. Pelosi saw firsthand what happened to Republicans when they impeached Bill Clinton in the 1990s. She\u2019s realistic that the Republican-controlled Senate wouldn\u2019t convict Trump to remove him from office if Democrats acted unilaterally, and she gave herself an out to change her mind if something new emerges.\n\nMany Democratic strategists believe that impeachment would give Trump a useful foil and get recalcitrant Republicans to rally behind him for 2020, barring big new bombshells from the investigations by special counsel Bob Mueller or newly empowered congressional committees. Pelosi is one of the shrewdest tacticians in modern political history, and she appears to be playing a long game of trying to increase her party\u2019s odds of keeping its majority.\n\n\u201cWhile liberal firebrands have won an outsize share of media coverage, the House Democratic majority was captured largely because of freshmen who ran to the center, said Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.), chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee \u2014 and many of them are uncomfortable with impeachment talk,\u201d Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade report.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got 31 Democrats who serve in districts that Donald Trump won, and I\u2019m one of them,\u201d Bustos said. \u201cWhen I go home, I don\u2019t have people asking me about impeaching him. That is just not something that I hear. They consistently ask about health care and rebuilding our country and figuring out how to work together.\u201d\n\nPelosi\u2019s comments will make it harder for Trump to say Democrats plan to impeach him and will tamp down on momentum to do so from the left.\n\nDuring her interview with Joe, the speaker was unequivocal that Trump is not fit to be president, ethically and intellectually. Then she demurred. \u201cI hardly ever talk about him,\u201d she explained. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s not about him. It\u2019s about what we can do for the people to lower health-care costs, bigger paychecks [and] cleaner government.\u201d\n\nPresident Trump celebrates the passage of the GOP tax cuts in December 2017 with Paul Ryan. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\n4. Paul Ryan on 2020: \u201cThe person who defines that race is going to win the race. If this is about Donald Trump and his personality, he isn\u2019t going to win it.\u201d\n\nThe former speaker of the House reportedly said during a speech last night in Vero Beach, Fla., that there are some Democrats who could beat Trump and the president must make the race about his policies, not his personal brand, if he\u2019s going to prevail.\n\n\u201cRyan said one of the House\u2019s biggest mistakes during his tenure was taking too long to negotiate a plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act,\u201d Ali Schmitz reports for Treasure Coast Newspapers. \u201cRyan blamed the right-leaning flank of the party, including the Freedom Caucus, for causing a three-month delay in moving the legislation through the House. \u2018That three-month delay eroded public support for it, so by the time it got over to the Senate, it was hanging on a thread,\u2019 Ryan said. Ryan said if there weren\u2019t delays in moving it through the House, he would have expected it to pass the Senate.\u201d\n\nThe 2012 GOP nominee for vice president said technology has created an outrage machine, according to the story: \u201cHe said people are \u2018monetizing\u2019 emotions, causing \u2018entertainment wings\u2019 of each party that focus on emotional responses rather than focusing on the merits\u201d of their policies.\n\n5. Tucker Carlson: \u201c[W]e will never bow to the mob \u2014 ever. No matter what.\u201d\n\nRyan didn\u2019t mention Carlson, but there\u2019s no doubt that the former House speaker was talking about people like him when he lamented the \u201centertainment wing\u201d of the GOP and the way it is \u201cmonetizing\u201d emotions.\n\nThe Fox News host opened his 8 p.m. show last night with a defiant, six-minute monologue in which he refused to show any contrition at all over a batch of offensive comments he made a decade ago.\n\nMeanwhile, \u201cMedia Matters for America published a new video with clips of the Fox News host using racist and homophobic language to describe Iraqi people, African Americans, gay people and immigrants while speaking on a radio program between 2006 and 2011,\u201d Michael Brice-Saddler and Eli Rosenberg report. \u201cThe self-described watchdog of \u2018conservative misinformation in the U.S. media\u2019 published the audio from Carlson\u2019s appearances on a Tampa-based radio program, the \u2018Bubba the Love Sponge Show,\u2019 just 25 hours after releasing similar recordings in which he\u2019s heard flippantly using sexist language to express his views on child rape, rape shield laws, underage marriage and other sensitive topics.\n\n\u201cThe new audio highlights about a dozen instances of Carlson using racist language on the \u2018shock jock\u2019 show, which he apparently called into for about an hour per week. In 2008, Carlson lamented that \u2018everyone\u2019s embarrassed to be a white man,\u2019 before stating that white men deserve credit for \u2018creating civilization and stuff.\u2019 In another instance, Carlson is heard saying that Iraq is a \u2018crappy place filled with a bunch of, you know, semiliterate primitive monkeys,\u2019 adding, \u2018That\u2019s why it wasn\u2019t worth invading.\u2019 That follows a 2006 segment on the show in which Carlson said he had \u2018zero sympathy\u2019 for Iraqi people and their culture because they \u2018don\u2019t use toilet paper or forks.\u2019\n\n\u201cCarlson also spoke crassly of immigrants and questioned Barack Obama\u2019s identity as a black man. \u2018How is he black, for one thing? He has one white parent, one black parent,\u2019 he said in 2006. Two years later, he added, \u2018I don\u2019t know how black he is, but I\u2019m sure he\u2019s a good basketball player \u2014 he says he is, anyway.\u2019\u201d\n\nCarlson went on the air about the same time the second video was released and said his critics weren\u2019t motivated by genuine concern. He said they\u2019re trying to silence him. Carlson praised the network for having his back even after the revelations.\n\n\u201cFirst, Fox News is behind us, as they have been since the very first day,\u201d he declared. \u201cToughness is a rare quality in a TV network, and we\u2019re grateful for that.\u201d\n\nWe live in an era of conservative counterpunchers. Tellingly, Donald Trump Jr. praised Carlson for refusing to apologize:\n\nThis is how to handle the outrage mob. Remember, even the most sincere apology means nothing to them. They want to break and ruin you. That\u2019s their end goal. https://t.co/gngwi5EKy4 \u2014 Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) March 11, 2019\n\n6. Donald Trump: \u201cThe Democrats hate Jewish people.\u201d\n\nAttendees say the president made that comment on Friday during a Republican National Committee fundraiser at his Mar-a-Lago Club.\n\nDuring her first news conference in more than 40 days, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders repeatedly declined to answer yesterday whether Trump truly believes Democrats \u201chate Jewish people.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s a question you ought to ask the Democrats,\u201d she said from the podium.\n\nGeorge W. Bush wrote in his memoir that Kanye West saying that \u201cBush doesn\u2019t care about black people\u201d after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 was the \u201call-time low\u201d point of his presidency. The rapper\u2019s comment generated massive controversy. West later apologized to Bush, who forgave him.\n\nIn this case, it\u2019s the president saying that the opposition party hates an entire faith of people and his press secretary not even trying to walk it back. The fact that it barely moves the needle shows how normalized over-the-top rhetoric, and questioning people\u2019s motives, has become in the Trump era.\n\nSanders criticized the anti-hate resolution that passed the House last week for not singling out allegedly anti-Semitic comments made by Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.). Trump allies say that he hopes to capitalize on the internal divisions among Democrats that the episode exposed, which pitted vocal newcomers on the far left, including Omar and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), against veteran lawmakers and Jewish members.\n\nThe numbers don\u2019t bear out Trump\u2019s claims. \u201cThirty-two of the 34 Jewish members of Congress are Democrats. According to the Pew Research Center, more than 70 percent of Jewish Americans voted for [Hillary Clinton] in the 2016 presidential election,\u201d Eugene Scott notes. \u201cAn October 2018 poll found that 74 percent of Jews planned to vote for Democratic candidates in the midterm elections. Three quarters of respondents disapproved of the president\u2019s policies. \u2026 The president has developed close ties with Israel, and in particular [Bibi Netanyahu], but being pro-Israel and being the party of American Jews is not the same thing.\u201d\n\nNeither does the record: \u201cAfter white nationalists marched through Charlottesville, chanting \u2018Jews will not replace us,\u2019 Trump called some of the protesters \u2018very fine people,\u2019\u201d Eugene recalls. \u201cDuring the 2016 campaign, the president defended the use of an image of a six-point star, which resembled the Star of David, over a pile of $100 bills. The image was part of an attack against Clinton; many Jewish leaders said it was anti-Semitic. At a speech to the Republican Jewish Coalition in 2015, Trump made comments that reinforced stereotypes about Jewish people. And in the final days of the campaign, he made headlines for running an ad that referenced the \u2018global power structure\u2019 attempting to control the world through Clinton while featuring images of prominent Jewish leaders.\u201d\n\nWelcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning briefing for decision-makers.\n\nSign up to receive the newsletter.\n\nWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\n\n-- Britain just banned the Boeing 737 Max from its airspace after China, Australia and other nations grounded the jets in the wake of the crash in Ethiopia. Gerry Shih reports: \u201cWhen China became the first country on Monday to order all Boeing 737 Max 8 planes grounded in the wake of the Ethiopian Airlines crash, its aviation regulator sent an unmistakable signal: the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration is no longer the only authority in civil aviation worldwide. \u2026 China\u2019s move, which was unprecedented for a government that once took cues from the FAA, was motivated by what Chinese officials and pilots said was months of equivocation from U.S. officials and Boeing in response to safety inquiries from China after the crash of a 737 Max 8 in Indonesia last October. \u2026\n\n\u201cAfter China ordered a dozen carriers to ground their 96 planes \u2014 roughly a quarter of all 737 Max in operation globally \u2014 authorities in Ethiopia, Singapore, Indonesia, Morocco and Mongolia quickly followed suit, as did carriers in Latin America and South Korea. Despite the FAA issuing a statement backing the Boeing jet\u2019s airworthiness, Britain, Australia, Malaysia and Oman became the latest countries to ground the model a day later, with authorities saying the aircraft would not be allowed to fly to or from their countries pending the investigation.\u201d\n\nThe U.S. embassy in Caracas.

Paul Schemm reports: \u201cThe United States and the government of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro are increasingly at odds, with the Trump administration openly supporting his rival, Juan Guaid\u00f3, as the country\u2019s legitimate leader. The country has been crippled by a five-day power outage that has plunged people into darkness and left food and water scarce. \u2026 The government announced that schools and commercial activities would again be suspended on Tuesday due to the power outage. \u2026 Appearing on television Monday, Maduro stated that progress was being made in restoring power. He blamed the crisis on sabotage.\u201d\n\n-- A Venezuelan journalist whom Maduro allies have accused of orchestrating the blackout is missing, and press freedom groups believe the government is holding him. The reporter, Luis Carlos Diaz, has been a frequent critic of Maduro's government and frequently been the target of online attacks by accounts close to Maduro's government after he revealed the state-run telephone and Internet provider in Venezuela was phishing its users.

(Cathy Free)\n\nMORE ON THE TRUMP BUDGET:\n\n-- Nancy Pelosi promised that the House will reject Trump\u2019s budget, and even many congressional Republicans criticized various elements of the proposal. Damian Paletta, Erica Werner and Jeff Stein report: \u201cAnd the demand for $8.6 billion for a border wall, less than two months after a 35-day shutdown paralyzed much of Washington, raised the possibility that there could be an even more dramatic impasse if a spending deal isn\u2019t reached by the end of September. \u2026 Top White House officials acknowledged that lawmakers routinely dismiss these budget proposals, but they signaled a willingness on Monday to fight harder this year than they have in the past. \u2026 Trump\u2019s GOP allies, meanwhile, received the budget plan with a lukewarm embrace. \u2026 The defense spending increase in the budget includes funneling more than $170 billion into a special overseas account, something even some Republicans dismissed as a gimmick aimed at getting around existing spending caps.\u201d\n\n-- Trump\u2019s proposal to cut Medicare spending by $845 billion over the next 10 years, despite his campaign promises to protect the popular program, will encounter some of the strongest resistance. From Jeff Stein and Amy Goldstein: \u201cMost of the trims relate to changing payments to doctors and hospitals \u2026 During the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump said he would not cut Medicare or Social Security, the retirement program for the elderly, but his budget last year also included a proposed cut of more than $550 billion to the program.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cMedicare-for-all v. Medicare-for-less: Trump\u2019s proposed cuts put health care at center of 2020 race,\u201d Toluse Olorunnipa and Sean Sullivan report: \u201cTrump\u2019s proposed Medicare savings are more than three times as large as those in his previous budget, and industry lobbying groups said the reductions would hurt hospitals and seniors. ... Democratic strategists and officials argued Monday that Trump\u2019s budget proposal exposed how little credibility Republicans have in debating health care, and showed signs of confidence that it would sharpen the contrast Democrats are seeking to make in the run-up to the 2020 election.\u201d\n\n-- Cronyism alert: One of the budget's clearest beneficiaries is Trump's golfing buddy Jack Nicklaus, the namesake of a children's hospital in Miami. Under the proposal, the Health and Human Services Department would steer $20 million toward a mobile children's hospital project at the Nicklaus Children's Hospital. Politico's Dan Diamond reports: Nicklaus \u201chad lobbied Trump on the golf course in Florida, and he met with HHS Secretary Alex Azar and then-OMB Director Mick Mulvaney in Washington, D.C., to request funds, say two individuals with knowledge. Trump personally directed HHS to earmark the funds to help Nicklaus develop mobile children's hospitals, one individual said.\u201d\n\n-- Trump\u2019s budget proposal would hit America\u2019s poor the hardest, \u201cslashing billions of dollars in food stamps, health insurance and federal housing subsidies while pushing legislation to institute broad work requirements for families receiving housing vouchers, expanding on moves by some states to require recipients of Medicaid and food stamps to work,\u201d Caitlin Dewey, Tracy Jan and Jeff Stein report.\n\nIt would gut the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program , better known as food stamps, by $17.2 billion and would redesign the entire program, using a portion of SNAP benefit money to buy and deliver a monthly food box. Eater\u2019s Whitney Filloon writes the proposal \u201cclaims the box would \u2018significantly reduc[e] the cost to taxpayers,\u2019\u201d but provides no information on how \u201cshipping a box of government-selected canned goods to millions of people would be at all cost-saving.\u201d\n\n, better known as food stamps, by $17.2 billion and would redesign the entire program, using a portion of SNAP benefit money to buy and deliver a monthly food box.

Trump called for cutting a federal housing subsidy program that experts estimate would result in more than a quarter-million low-income families losing assistance.\n\n-- The budget would slash $8.5 billion from the Department of Education. Moriah Balingit and Danielle Douglas-Gabriel report: \u201cTrump\u2019s budget request again seeks to cut popular programs, including one that supports after-school activities for children in impoverished communities and another that offers wide-ranging grants that underwrite textbooks, equipment, counseling services and other needs for schools. That pool of money \u2014 the Student Support and Academic Enrichment grant program \u2014 also underwrites school safety efforts, including mental-health services and school safety equipment.\u201d\n\n-- The budget would also make federal workers pay more toward their retirement benefits until the employee and government share is equal. Eric Yoder reports: \u201cFor most employees that would mean an increase of about six percentage points, which would be phased in as one percentage point more per year. The government share would decrease on the same schedule. Also under the proposal, for employees retiring after an unspecified date, annuity benefits would be based on the highest five consecutive salary years rather than the currently used 'high-3.' Further, it would end a supplemental benefit paid to many employees who retire before age 62, when they become eligible for Social Security.\u201d\n\n-- House Dems are likely to skip a vote on a budget this year to avoid what could be an embarrassing intraparty battle. Though publicly many Democrats have said they want a chance to vote on their party\u2019s fiscal blueprint, privately they\u2019re saying that a budget is unlikely to come to a vote given the multiple divisions within the caucus.

Michael Cohen testified during last month's hearing that Trump inflated his assets in financial statements, and Cohen provided copies of statements he said had been submitted to Deutsche Bank. \u201cThe inquiry by Ms. James\u2019s office is a civil investigation, not a criminal one, although its focus and scope were unclear,\u201d the Times\u2019s William K. Rashbaum and Danny Hakim report.\n\n-- House Oversight Committee Chairman Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) is seeking testimony from two lawyers responsible for Trump\u2019s ethical and financial disclosures. But the White House is blocking him from talking to a potentially key witness. CNN's Jeremy Herb and Pamela Brown report: \u201cWhite House Counsel Pat Cipollone accused the committee of making 'grossly unfair' allegations against Stefan Passantino and Trump's personal attorney Sheri Dillon \u2014 both of whom Cummings wants to interview \u2014 and damaging their reputations. Last month, Cummings sent a letter to Cipollone that stated the committee has obtained new documents showing Passantino and Dillon 'may have provided false information' when they were questioned by federal ethics officials about hush money payments paid to adult-film actress Stormy Daniels. ... In response, Cipollone chided Cummings for directly requesting an interview with Passantino, instead of going through the White House counsel's office, and said the White House would not make Passantino available.\u201d\n\n-- Contradicting Cohen's sworn testimony, Stormy Daniels\u2019s former lawyer Keith Davidson said Trump\u2019s longtime fixer was outraged when no White House position materialized for him. ABC News\u2019s Tom Llamas and Kaitlyn Folmer report: \u201cThe man who once famously said he would \u2018take a bullet\u2019 for Trump was left embarrassed and embittered, Davidson said, when despite his years of loyalty, he was not tapped for a position, like White House chief of staff or attorney general, in Trump's administration. \u2018He confided in me that he was just beside himself, and, in his words, you know, he said, 'Can you \u2026 believe, after everything I've done, he's not taking me to Washington?'\u2018 Davidson recalled. \u2018He felt that it was a personal embarrassment for him, that he was rejected.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Former acting attorney general Matt Whitaker will return to Capitol Hill tomorrow for a private meeting with the House Judiciary Committee. Karoun Demirjian reports: \u201cIn a letter to Whitaker after his testimony, Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) said members of the panel found Whitaker\u2019s answers \u2018unsatisfactory, incomplete, or contradicted by other evidence,\u2019 stressing that they wanted to meet with him again so he could \u2018elaborate\u2019 on his testimony. \u2026 Nadler questioned Whitaker\u2019s testimony indicating that he never discussed Trump\u2019s frustration with Michael Cohen.\u201d\n\n-- The Senate Intelligence Committee spoke privately to Simona Mangiante Papadopoulos, who is married to former Trump campaign foreign policy aide George Papadopoulos. Karoun Demirjian reports: \u201cThe panel asked Mangiante Papadopoulos about her former employer Joseph Mifsud, a London-based professor with suspected ties to the Kremlin ... Mifsud, prosecutors have said, offered to help her husband ... broker meetings between the Trump campaign and Russian officials \u2026 Mangiante Papadopoulos said congressional investigators were more focused on her experience working with Mifsud than what she knew of her husband\u2019s activities during the campaign.\u201d\n\n-- Attorneys for Roger Stone apologized in a new filing last night for misrepresenting to a federal judge plans about his new book criticizing Bob Mueller. But they said it was an unintentional mistake and the court can still seat an impartial jury. Spencer S. Hsu reports: \u201cAttorneys for the Republican operative and longtime friend of President Trump acknowledge that the gaffe could land Stone in jail if the judge finds he violated a gag order in his case barring him from feeding prejudicial pretrial publicity. But they denied using an erroneous March 1 filing notifying the court of the 'imminent release' of the book \u2014 after the judge imposed the gag order Feb. 21 \u2014 to build publicity for the work, 'The Myth of Russian Collusion,' a retitled version of his earlier book about Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign, with a new introduction. 'There was/is no intention to hide anything,' wrote Stone\u2019s attorneys.\u201d\n\n-- The same federal judge overseeing Stone\u2019s criminal case, Amy Berman Jackson, will decide tomorrow whether to add prison time to Manafort\u2019s sentence. Spencer reports: \u201cThe looming question Wednesday is whether any prison time Jackson might impose will overlap or be tacked on to the 47-month term Manafort received last week from U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III in Alexandria. \u2026 In overseeing the Manafort case and the separate case of [Stone], Jackson has given a master class in how to try high-profile cases, some colleagues on the bench said, by relying on preparation, discretion and a refusal to get drawn into side disputes.\u201d\n\n-- For what it's worth, the special counsel's effort is fully funded through the end of September. After that, Mueller can request funding for the next fiscal year by the end of June.

The Southwest Key shelter in a former Walmart superstore in Brownsville, Tex., known as Casa Padre, became a symbol of the Trump administration\u2019s family separation policy, with immigration advocates likening it to a warehouse for children.

CBP did not answer specific questions about whether there are any guidelines for how other technology companies involved in processing the data can potentially also use it. ... CBP did not explain what its current policies around data sharing of biometric information with participating companies and third-party firms are, but it did say that the agency 'retains photos \u2026 for up to 14 days' of non-US citizens departing the country, for 'evaluation of the technology' and 'assurance of the accuracy of the algorithms' \u2014 which implies such photos might be used for further training of its facial matching AI.\u201d\n\nFacial recognition technology is already at use in 17 international airports, including New York, Atlanta, Boston, Chicago and Houston.

A possible series of votes this week will help determine whether Britain will depart on schedule on March 29 \u2014 or whether there will be more uncertainty, division and delay.\u201d\n\n-- Pelosi and Mitch McConnell extended a rare bipartisan invitation to NATO secretary general Jens Stoltenberg to address a joint session of Congress next month. Seung Min Kim, Rachael Bade and Robert Costa report: \u201cNATO declined to say whether Stoltenberg would accept the invitation, saying that his schedule during his Washington trip in April \u2018will be announced in due course.\u2019 The invitation could put the NATO leader in a slightly awkward position. Stoltenberg has gone to great lengths to foster a positive relationship with Trump. If the congressional invitation were seen as too direct a rebuke to the White House, it could suck him into a domestic U.S. political battle he has been eager to avoid.\u201d\n\n-- The Trump administration threatened to scale back its intelligence sharing with Germany if Berlin allows the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei to participate in the country\u2019s development of a 5G network. The Wall Street Journal\u2019s Bojan Pancevski and Sara Germano report: The threat \u201cmarks the first time the U.S. has explicitly warned an ally that refusing to ostracize Huawei could lessen security cooperation with Washington. \u2026 Both German and U.S. officials said the threat from Washington will unsettle Germany\u2019s security community, which is a big consumer of intelligence provided by the National Security Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency and other U.S. information gatherers.\u201d\n\n-- The Trump administration has taken a harder-line approach to denuclearizing North Korea since the president's failed second summit with Kim Jong Un last month. John Hudson reports: \u201cIn remarks Monday, a top U.S. envoy said the United States would not lift sanctions on North Korea until it completely dismantles its nuclear and ballistic missiles. The United States is also seeking an end to Pyongyang\u2019s chemical and biological weapons, he said. \u2026 Confronted with North Korea\u2019s insistence on major sanctions relief at the summit, the United States made a counterproposal demanding full sanctions relief for full denuclearization, said the diplomats, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive negotiations.\u201d\n\n-- Syrian government forces have frequently subjected male prisoners to sexual violence. Louisa Loveluck reports: \u201cAccording to a report released Monday by Lawyers and Doctors for Human Rights, a Syrian rights group, security forces have used rape and enforced sterilization, as well as the tying, burning and mutilation of men\u2019s genitals, to force confessions and submission.\u201d\n\nKirsten Gillibrand worships at Mount Moriah Missionary Baptist Church in South Carolina last month. (Meg Kinnard/AP)\n\n2020 WATCH:\n\n-- Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) continues to defend her office's investigation into sexual harassment claims made by a former aide. She said she has no regrets about the way it was handled and she has not spoken with the woman who made the claims since she left her staff last summer. (Felicia Sonmez)\n\n-- Beto O\u2019Rourke is expected to launch his presidential campaign very soon, even though he has not really prepared in the traditional way. The New York Times\u2019s Matt Flegenheimer and Lisa Lerer report: \u201cThere has been no flirtation tour in Iowa, no trip to New Hampshire since his college years as an Ivy League rower. Mr. O\u2019Rourke had no traditional campaign-in-waiting at the ready after the midterms \u2026 Few doubt Mr. O\u2019Rourke\u2019s capacity to upend the race regardless, buoyed by a talent for relentless retail politics, a formidable low-dollar fundraising army and an unsubtle contrast to front-runners in their 70s, like [Biden and Sanders]. \u2026 But perhaps no major 2020 player invites as many question marks as Mr. O\u2019Rourke, and his drawn-out non-candidacy has provided few answers.\u201d O\u2019Rourke announced in a Twitter video that he would make his first visit to Iowa this weekend.\n\n-- Stacey Abrams, who also lost the Georgia gubernatorial race last year, said she could run for president in 2020 after saying previously that 2028 would be the earliest race she'd consider. (CNN)\n\n-- Under fire, Facebook quickly reversed its decision to pull ads by Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s campaign calling for the breakup of the social media giant. Politico\u2019s Cristiano Lima reports: \u201cThe ads, which had identical images and text, touted Warren's recently announced plan to unwind \u2018anti-competitive\u2019 tech mergers, including Facebook\u2019s acquisition of WhatsApp and Instagram. \u2026 A message on the three ads said: \u2018This ad was taken down because it goes against Facebook's advertising policies.\u2019 A Facebook spokesperson confirmed the ads had been taken down but said the company is in the process of restoring them.\u201d\n\n-- Related: Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) sent a letter to the Federal Trade Commission accusing the agency of allowing Facebook and other tech giants to mishandle consumers\u2019 private data. Tony Romm reports: \u201cHawley said there is \u2018substantial evidence\u2019 that Facebook had broken a 2011 agreement with the FTC that settled an earlier probe into its privacy practices \u2014 a breach that could trigger steep federal fines.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cCourt packing\u201d is gaining currency among far-left activists, who in turn are trying to prod presidential candidates to embrace it. Michael Scherer reports: \u201cFormer attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr., who recently decided against running for president, became the latest figure to embrace an expansion of the nine-member court in recent talks at Yale Law School and Columbia University. \u2026 [South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg] has also discussed a 15-justice structure for the court \u2014 five Democratic appointees, five Republican appointees and five chosen by the other 10. \u2026 The concept of expanding the Supreme Court, like the phrase \u2018court packing\u2019 itself, fell into lengthy disrepute after 1937, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt ... sought to add six friendlier justices, prompting an outcry even from allies.\n\n-- The strong showings of Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders in the latest Iowa poll are impressive but shouldn\u2019t be overemphasized, Dan Balz writes: \u201cThe poll should be read in two ways \u2014 as a sign of initial strength for each of them, and as an indication of the vulnerabilities the two best-known figures in the race could face. \u2026 With a big field assembling, those numbers \u2014 Biden at 27 percent and Sanders at 25 percent \u2014 are helpful but not overwhelmingly impressive. At every candidate event this year, there are more shoppers than buyers, and any number of candidates are drawing crowds and good reviews. Other candidates are and will have their moments. Still, it is notable that Biden and Sanders are where they are, given who they are.\u201d\n\n-- This week, Biden will address the International Association of Firefighters and the Delaware Democratic Party, two supportive audiences that will serve as the final test drive before the former vice president makes a 2020 decision. From NBC News\u2019s Mike Memoli: \u201cThe coming week may be a point of no return for him, as aides recognize that the party\u2019s patience is wearing thin. To the extent advisers identify any potential hurdles he\u2019s still reckoning with, they are parallel: how and when to engage with attacks from the most strident partisan voices in both parties, including Trump.\u201d No final decisions have been made on what Biden\u2019s campaign platform would be, but advisers said their starting point is similar to the one he sketched out when he considered joining the 2016 race which includes:\n\nA $15 per-hour minimum wage\n\nFree tuition at public colleges and universities\n\nA tax code overhaul to treat investment income as earned income.\n\n-- Many of New York Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s closest aides are trying to talk him out of running for president. Politico\u2019s Laura Nahmias and Sally Goldenberg report: \u201cAs de Blasio touted his liberal record in Iowa and South Carolina in recent weeks, nearly three dozen former and current aides, consultants and allies ... panned the idea or doubted that the mayor would run for the Democratic nomination. Aside from the few people working on the nascent effort, only two said de Blasio should run.\u201d\n\n-- The large Democratic field is stressing out a very specific group of people: pollsters. Politico's Steven Shepard reports: \u201cNew surveys are cramming up to 23 Democrats into their questionnaires after the Democratic National Committee set a low, 1 percent polling threshold to gain admittance into the party\u2019s first primary debates. The miles-long list of candidates has created an unusual set of methodological challenges for pollsters already battling declining engagement with their surveys. ... The 2020 race presents a different problem: which candidates to include. Most pollsters are choosing to list as many candidates as possible \u2014 even at the risk of flooding poll respondents with a long list of names.\u201d\n\n-- Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) will speak at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics's Politics & Eggs series. It's a common campaign stop for White House hopefuls. Hogan is weighing a primary challenge to Trump. (Ovetta Wiggins)\n\n-- Some NRA leaders are expressing concern about NRATV, the group\u2019s streaming service that has attracted controversy as its hosts have wandered far from the issue of gun rights. The New York Times\u2019s Danny Hakim reports: \u201cSince its creation in 2016, it has adopted an increasingly apocalyptic, hard-right tone, warning of race wars, describing Barack Obama as a \u2018fresh-faced flower-child president,\u2019 calling for a march on the Federal Bureau of Investigation and comparing journalists to rodents. In recent weeks, in a rare airing of internal debate at the N.R.A., two prominent board members expressed concerns about NRATV.\u201d\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\n\nA prominent Republican strategist predicted that Trump may soon start searching for a new running mate:\n\nAs I\u2019ve been tweeting since last year, watch for Trump to dump Pence later this year.

The message of the film is conveyed less through the story than through its casting: women and people of color need to have starring roles in major Hollywood productions, which, at the moment, mainly mean big-budget superhero movies, the most profitable films in the industry. Its implicit subject is more than representation \u2014 it\u2019s also the redistribution of power in Hollywood. There are some secondary (but still significant) messages, too, but the movie itself is, for the most part, trivial.

    "text": "With Joanie Greve and Mariana Alfaro\n\nTHE BIG IDEA: President Trump\u2019s got 99 problems, and his businesses are causing many of them.\n\nThe president\u2019s private business holdings, which he refused to divest when he took office, are causing growing political headaches \u2013 leading to festering questions about conflicts of interest and fresh charges of hypocrisy and creating fertile ground for newly empowered congressional investigators who have subpoena power.\n\nFour new stories highlight the diverse array of challenges that Trump\u2019s businesses pose as he seeks reelection in 2020:\n\n1) Immigration\n\nThe Washington Post has now interviewed 33 immigrants who lacked legal status when they worked for the president\u2019s clubs, highlighting Trump\u2019s long reliance on low-wage immigrants who are not authorized to be in the United States and underscoring anew the degree to which he doesn\u2019t practice what he preaches.\n\nJuan Quintero is the latest former Trump employee to tell his remarkable story on the record. He spent eight hours each weekday as a groundskeeper at the Trump National Golf Club Hudson Valley in Hopewell Junction, N.Y. Then, as a contractor, he would put in five additional hours as the caretaker of a 171-acre hunting retreat that serves as a private weekend getaway for the president\u2019s sons.\n\nQuintero, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico, was fired in January after revelations about the Trump Organization\u2019s extensive use of illegal labor prompted the company to conduct an audit. He shared his text messages with Eric Trump, which show the president\u2019s son was closely monitoring his work. (The number matches his personal cellphone. He was saved in the contacts as \u201cErik Boss.\u201d)\n\n\u201cHis work at the shooting range deepens questions about what measures the Trump family and its businesses have taken to prevent the hiring of workers the president casts as invaders and criminals,\u201d Josh Partlow, Nick Miroff and Dave Fahrenthold report. \u201cQuintero said he never directly told Eric Trump about his immigration status. But he said he remained employed by the hunting lodge for more than a year after not providing the owners with a Social Security number when they sought to issue him a debit card. Quintero and other former Trump workers said they believe that their supervisors knew they lacked legal status.\u201d\n\nGabriel Sedano, a maintenance worker from Mexico, said in January that he had a set of keys for a home that Eric Trump used at the Trump course in Westchester County, N.Y. My colleagues have previously reported that the Trump Organization employed immigrant workers without legal status at five golf courses in New York and New Jersey. The president\u2019s club in Bedminster, N.J., was built and maintained by dozens of laborers from Costa Rica and other Latin American countries. The New York Times published a story in December about two immigrant housekeepers who worked at that club without proper papers.\n\n\u201cIn January, the Trump Organization announced that it would expand the use of the government\u2019s E-Verify program to screen new hires at all of its U.S. properties,\u201d Josh, Nick and Dave note. \u201cThe company had not widely used the tool, despite a claim to the contrary by Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign.\u201d\n\nA U.S. Coast Guard boat patrols outside President Trump's Mar-a-Lago Club in Palm Beach, Fla. (J. David Ake/AP)\n\n2) Cronyism and conflicts of interest\n\nThere is a pattern of dues-paying members of Trump\u2019s private clubs getting special access to the president that ordinary people could only dream of.\n\nThe latest illustration comes from ProPublica, which yesterday published a letter on Mar-a-Lago stationery that Trump directed an aide to pass along to then-Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin. Trump had run into Albert Hazzouri, a cosmetic dentist from Pennsylvania who is a member of the club, during a 2017 visit to the members-only club he owns in Palm Beach, Fla. Hazzouri later provided the president a handwritten note, in which he refers to Trump as \u201cKing.\u201d The president then scrawled that it should be passed onto the VA, which it was.\n\n\u201cIn a telephone interview, Hazzouri said he sent the note as a favor to the 163,000-member American Dental Association. He said he had only the vaguest sense of what proposal he was vouching for,\u201d Isaac Arnsdorf reports. \u201cMichael Graham, who heads the ADA's lobbying arm in Washington, recalled that one of his staffers raised the topic with Hazzouri, but Graham said he didn\u2019t know the details. In general, Graham said, the organization wants the government to pay for more dental services.\u201d\n\nProPublica also reported last year that Trump handed sweeping influence over the VA to Ike Perlmutter, another member of Mar-a-Lago and a big donor to his campaign, along with a physician and a lawyer who regularly visit the president\u2019s resort. \u201cThe trio, known as the \u2018Mar-a-Lago Crowd,\u2019 acted as a shadow leadership for the department, reviewing all manner of policy and personnel decisions, including budgeting and contracting,\u201d Arnsdorf notes. \u201cThe House veterans committee is now investigating the trio\u2019s \u2018alleged improper influence.\u2019\u201d\n\nTrump Organization COO Allen Weisselberg stands between Donald Trump and Donald Trump Jr. during a January 2017 news conference in the lobby of Trump Tower. (Evan Vucci/AP)\n\n3) More congressional investigations\n\nFueled by leads and names provided to them by former Trump Organization senior executive Michael Cohen, House Democrats are preparing to perform a veritable colonoscopy of the president\u2019s businesses. The president\u2019s tax returns, which they are pursuing, could offer a road map.\n\nMany senior House Democrats are reluctant to scrutinize Trump's oldest children too closely because they believe it\u2019s bad optics and could backfire politically. They would prefer to leave that to federal prosecutors. But that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019ll be spared. \u201cYet Trump\u2019s family members \u2014 including Donald Jr., Eric, Ivanka and son-in-law Jared Kushner \u2014 are so deeply involved in his business and presidency that it likely would be impossible to take a completely hands-off approach,\u201d Politico\u2019s Andrew Desiderio and John Bresnahan report. Don Jr. is of special interest to some Democrats \u201cgiven Cohen\u2019s characterizations of the president\u2019s eldest son\u2019s alleged involvement in hush-money payments and other incidents that are central to ongoing federal inquiries.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon Jr. is right in the middle of all of this. \u2026 He\u2019s like everywhere. And certainly in that case I think he would be fair game for questions,\u201d Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.), a member of the Oversight and Intelligence committees, told Politico. \u201cIn his case, he is a material witness.\u201d\n\nA number of trees were cut down at the Trump National Golf Club near Sterling, Va., in February. (Dean Naujoks/Potomac Riverkeeper Network)\n\n4) Environmental stewardship\n\nA county in Virginia announced yesterday it has fined the Trump National Golf Club for improperly chopping down trees along the Potomac River. \u201cThe cutting and disposal of a dozen mature trees \u2026 nearly two weeks ago \u2026 violated Loudoun County\u2019s zoning ordinance \u2026 and could cost the organization at least $600,\u201d Patricia Sullivan reports. \u201cThe downed trees were spotted Feb. 23 by Steven McKone, director of the Calleva River School, as he kayaked the river. Subsequent paddlers and boaters saw about a dozen stumps 14 to 24 inches in width, and large tree trunks in the Potomac. The removal of the trees from a flood plain along the river requires a permit, which the golf course did not obtain, county officials said \u2026 The county ordered the golf course to stop all activity in the flood plain until it obtains the necessary permits.\n\n\u201cTrees in a waterway can create dangerous conditions,\u201d Pat notes. \u201cCurrents can pull watercraft into the branches, then trap boaters underwater. In addition, trees along riverbanks are among the best ways to protect water quality and aquatic life and prevent erosion, environmental advocates say. In 2010, the Trump club cut more than 400 trees from its property when it renovated its courses. Nine months later, Donald Trump told a Washington Post reporter that the tree removal was done to create a better view.\u201d\n\nWelcome to the Daily 202, PowerPost's morning briefing for decision-makers.\n\nSign up to receive the newsletter.\n\nGET SMART FAST:\u200b\u200b\n\nFederal prosecutors finalized a deal that would undo the criminal charges against former congressman Aaron Schock (R-Ill.), who was accused of misspending campaign and government money for his personal benefit. The 37-year-old conceded as part of the deferred prosecution agreement that he had done some wrong and agreed to pay taxes he skipped and reimburse his campaign committees nearly $68,000. But the case that once threatened to put Schock in prison almost certainly will end without him being convicted \u2014 marking a stunning reversal for the government. (Matt Zapotosky) A campaign donor close to Sen.

(Michael Brice-Saddler)\n\nTHERE\u2019S A BEAR IN THE WOODS:\n\n-- Michael Cohen directed his former legal team to seek a pardon from the president's lawyers, his current attorney said last night. Cohen had said during public testimony before lawmakers last week that he \u201cnever asked for, nor would I accept, a pardon from President Trump.\u201d Karoun Demirjian and Robert Costa report: \u201cCohen\u2019s lawyer Lanny J. Davis said in an interview that Cohen directed his former attorney, Stephen Ryan, to contact Trump\u2019s representatives after they 'dangled' the possibility of pardons 'in their public statements.' Davis did not specify which public statements swayed Cohen, saying only that the outreach took place before federal law enforcement raided Cohen\u2019s home and office in April 2018.\u201d\n\nThe Post was unable to reach Ryan late last night. Rudy Giuliani, Trump's personal lawyer, wouldn't confirm whether he had this conversation with Cohen's attorneys. But Giuliani might not be the only lawyer with whom Cohen discussed pardons: \u201cCohen told lawmakers on the House Intelligence Committee that he also spoke about a pardon with Trump\u2019s attorney Jay Sekulow, according to four people familiar with his statements ... Sekulow flatly denied Cohen\u2019s allegation, calling it 'not true' \u2014 and declining to elaborate further. ...\n\n\u201cCohen gave the House Intelligence Committee documents that purportedly illustrate how the president\u2019s lawyers edited his 2017 statements to Congress. ... The committee has not made those documents public. According to people familiar with what\u2019s contained in the documents, the changes were plentiful \u2014 indicating Trump\u2019s legal team had been apprised of what Cohen planned to tell lawmakers in 2017.\u201d\n\n-- Two New York attorneys who claimed to be connected to Giuliani approached Cohen in the weeks following the raid of his Manhattan office in what seems to be an attempt to keep him on the president\u2019s side, per ABC News\u2019s Eliana Larramendia, James Hill and Lauren Pearle: \u201cThe sources familiar with the contacts said the two lawyers first reached out to Cohen late in April of last year and that the discussions continued for about two months. The attorneys, who have no known formal ties to the White House, urged Cohen not to leave the joint defense agreement ... and also offered a Plan B. In the event Cohen opted to exit the agreement, they could join his legal team and act as a conduit between Cohen and the president\u2019s lawyers. At one point in the discussions, one of the attorneys sent Cohen a phone screenshot to prove they were in touch with Giuliani.\u201d\n\n-- The Department of Justice appointed a prosecutor who has been working on special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s team to lead a foreign influence unit that will investigate unregistered foreign agents. CNN\u2019s Erica Orden reports: Brandon Van Grack\u2019s \u201cappointment to the newly created position and the Justice Department's interest in expanding its pursuit of foreign influence cases stemmed largely from the impact of Russian operations on the 2016 presidential election, John Demers, the head of the national security division, said Wednesday at a conference on white-collar crime. \u2026 Demers added that the Justice Department is considering seeking congressional authorization for administrative subpoena power to enforce the Foreign Agents Registration Act, which it currently lacks.\u201d\n\n-- A New York federal appeals court is considering unsealing confidential files that could reveal evidence of an underage sex trafficking operation allegedly run by multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein and British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell. Epstein was given an unusually lenient plea deal by then-U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta, who is now the secretary of labor. The Miami Herald\u2019s Julie K. Brown reports: \u201cThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reserved judgment in the case, but the panel suggested it was leaning toward the release to the public of vast portions of the court record. The file on the case, which was settled in 2017, contains more than 1,000 documents, lawyers said during oral arguments led by the Miami Herald, which seeks to open the entire file.\"\n\nTHE IMMIGRATION WARS:\n\n-- \u201cA Homeland Security source\u201d leaked documents to the NBC affiliate in San Diego showing that the U.S. government created a secret database of activists, journalists and lawyers who were tied to the migrant caravan and, in some cases, placed alerts on their passports, keeping at least three photojournalists and a lawyer from entering Mexico to work: \u201cAs the migrant caravan reached the San Ysidro Port of Entry in south San Diego County, so did journalists, attorneys, and advocates who were there to work and witness the events unfolding. But in the months that followed, journalists who covered the caravan, as well as those who offered assistance to caravan members, said they felt they had become targets of intense inspections and scrutiny by border officials. \u2026 Their fears weren\u2019t baseless. \u2026 The intelligence gathering efforts were done under the umbrella of \u2018Operation Secure Line,\u2019 the operation designated to monitor the migrant caravan ... The documents list people who officials think should be targeted for screening at the border. The individuals listed include ten journalists, seven of whom are U.S. citizens, a U.S. attorney, and 47 people from the U.S. and other countries, labeled as organizers, instigators or their roles \u2018unknown.\u2019 The target list includes advocates from organizations like Border Angels and Pueblo Sin Fronteras.\u201d\n\n-- Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross broke several laws and violated the Constitution when he added a citizenship question to the 2020 Census in \u201cbad faith,\u201d a second federal judge ruled yesterday. Fred Barbash reports: \u201cIn finding a breach of the Constitution\u2019s enumeration clause, which requires a census every 10 years to determine each state\u2019s representation in Congress, the 126-page ruling by U.S. District Judge Richard Seeborg in San Francisco went further than a similar decision on Jan. 15 by Judge Jesse Furman in New York. \u2026 Unable to find any expert in the Census Bureau who approved of his plan to add the citizenship question, Seeborg wrote, Ross engaged in a \u2018cynical search to find some reason, any reason\u2019 to justify the decision. \u2026 He was fully aware that the question would produce a census undercount, particularly among Latinos, the judge said. \u2026\n\n\u201cSeeborg, like Furman, found after a trial that Ross misrepresented both to the public and Congress his reasons for adding the citizenship question last March. Ross claimed he was acting at the request of the Justice Department in the interest of enforcing the Voting Rights Act. In reality, the \u2018evidence establishes\u2019 that the voting rights explanation was just \u2018a pretext\u2019 and that Ross \u2018acted in bad faith\u2019 when he claimed otherwise.\u201d\n\n-- The Census Bureau is quietly collecting information about the legal status of millions of immigrants as the Supreme Court decides whether the Trump administration is allowed to ask people if they are U.S. citizens in the 2020 Census. From the AP\u2019s Garance Burke and Frank Bajak: \u201cUnder a proposed plan, the Department of Homeland Security would provide the Census Bureau with a broad swath of personal data about noncitizens, including their immigration status ... The data that Homeland Security would share with Census officials would include noncitizens\u2019 full names and addresses, birth dates and places, as well as Social Security numbers and highly sensitive alien registration numbers, according to a document signed by the Census Bureau and obtained by AP.\u201d\n\n-- The U.S. Army mishandled the sensitive personnel information of hundreds of immigrant recruits, leaving them extremely vulnerable to severe punishment in their home countries. Alex Horton reports: \u201cA spreadsheet intended for internal coordination among recruiters was accidentally sent to recruits and contained names, full Social Security numbers and enlistment dates. The list was sent out inadvertently at least three times between July 2017 and January 2018. The breach prompted at least a dozen asylum claims amid concern that if the list were intercepted and recruits are forced to return to autocratic nations such as China or Russia, their enlistments would be harnessed to punish recruits or their families with jail time, harsh interrogations or worse, said Rep. Tom Malinowski (D-N.J.), a former human rights official in the State Department under President Barack Obama.\u201d\n\n-- Border agents have been ordered to explicitly target Spanish speakers and migrants from Latin America when carrying out a Trump administration program requiring asylum seekers to wait in Mexico. From the AP\u2019s Elliot Spagat: \u201cThe guidance includes instruction about various groups of immigrants who are not to be sent back to Mexico and instead go through the traditional asylum process in the U.S. immigration court system. They include pregnant women, LGBT migrants and people suffering medical issues. Authorities said previously that Mexican asylum seekers are excluded, as are children traveling alone. \u2026 Critics pointed out that the guidelines and exclusions are written in a way that make the program almost entirely focused on Central Americans. Judy Rabinovitz, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, said the criteria \u2018does smack of the same concerns we had in the Muslim ban.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Former White House chief of staff and homeland security secretary John Kelly said he disagreed with some of the Trump administration\u2019s policies, particularly on immigration, during an appearance at Duke University. From NBC News\u2019s Carol E. Lee:\n\nKelly declined to defend Trump\u2019s decision to declare a national emergency to get funding for a border wall. \u201cWe don\u2019t need a wall from sea to shining sea,\u201d he said.\n\nContradicting Trump, Kelly said undocumented immigrants are \u201coverwhelmingly not criminals.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re people coming up here for economic purposes. I don\u2019t blame them for that,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re people coming up here for economic purposes. I don\u2019t blame them for that,\u201d he said. Kelly declined to talk about the process behind the granting of security clearances to Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, but didn't deny reports that the president circumvented the usual process or that Kelly later wrote a memo outlining his concerns about it. He said he believes any such conversations with the president would be protected by privilege.\n\n-- Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen testified on the Hill that the U.S. is on track to detain more than 900,000 migrants at the southern border by the end of this fiscal year. Maria Sacchetti reports: \u201cAfter a major spike in border crossings last month, U.S. Customs and Border Protection is on track to detain far more than the 521,000 taken into custody in fiscal 2018, she said. That would require sustained border crossings at rates unseen in more than a decade. \u2026 She called the mass migration of Central American families arriving in cold, remote border outposts a \u2018humanitarian catastrophe.\u2019 \u2018This is a legitimate national emergency,\u2019 she said before the Homeland Security Committee.\u201d\n\n-- During the hearing, Nielsen insisted that children who were separated from their parents had not been held in \u201ccages.\u201d Aaron Blake reports: \u201cIn an exchange with Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), he brought up the 'cages,' and Nielsen took exception. 'Sir, we don\u2019t use cages for children,' Nielsen said. She drew a small box with her arms to suggest only a much-smaller enclosure would qualify. 'Sir, they\u2019re not cages.' Thompson asked what they were, and Nielsen said they were 'areas of the border facility that are carved out for the safety and protection of those who remain there while they\u2019re being processed.' Rep. Bonnie Watson Coleman (D-N.J.) followed up later and asked Nielsen to explain further. 'What is a chain-link fence, enclosed into a chamber on a concrete floor represent to you?' she asked. 'Is that a cage?' 'It\u2019s a detention space, as you know, that has existed for decades,' Nielsen said, adding: 'It\u2019s larger. It has facilities. There are places to sit, to stand, to lay down.' 'So does my dog\u2019s cage,' Watson Coleman responded.\"\n\nDEMOCRATS IN DISARRAY:\n\n-- House Democrats argued bitterly during a closed-door meeting yesterday over whether to rebuke Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) for alleged anti-Semitic remarks. Mike DeBonis and Rachael Bade report: \u201cOmar suggested last week that Israel\u2019s supporters have an \u2018allegiance to a foreign country\u2019 \u2026 Her defenders argued that leadership was applying a double standard in singling out one of the two Muslim women in Congress. \u2026 The session quickly became rancorous. \u2026 Plans for a quick vote appeared to fade amid the uproar. Democratic leaders openly fretted that the divisions would overshadow their legislative agenda, especially a planned Friday vote on a major campaign and ethics reform bill.\u201d\n\n\u201c Multiple House members stood up to challenge the decision \u2014 endorsed by [Nancy] Pelosi and the rest of the House Democratic leadership \u2014 to move forward with a resolution condemning religious hatred. Initially the measure targeted only anti-Semitism, with some Democrats pushing for a direct rebuke of Omar, but by Tuesday night \u2014 facing backlash from members not on board with the plan \u2014 leaders decided to expand it to include anti-Muslim bias.\u201d\n\nInitially the measure targeted only anti-Semitism, with some Democrats pushing for a direct rebuke of Omar, but by Tuesday night \u2014 facing backlash from members not on board with the plan \u2014 leaders decided to expand it to include anti-Muslim bias.\u201d \u201c But other lawmakers, including a group of Jewish members who pushed to pass the resolution focused on anti-Semitism, remain convinced that the House needs to act in response to Omar\u2019s remarks.\u201d\n\n\u201c For Democrats, the internal divide \u2026 has been exacerbated by members targeting each other on Twitter. \u2026 On Tuesday, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) knocked Rep. Juan Vargas (D-Calif.) on Twitter for saying that questioning the U.S.-Israel relationship should be out of bounds. \u2026 At one point during the meeting, Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), a close Pelosi ally, pleaded with Democrats: \u2018Everyone stop tweeting!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u2026 On Tuesday, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) knocked Rep.

Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), a close Pelosi ally, pleaded with Democrats: \u2018Everyone stop tweeting!\u2019\u201d \u201cLater Wednesday, the Congressional Black Caucus met to discuss how to handle the issue, but the group\u2019s chair, Rep. Karen Bass (D-Calif.), said it would not take an official position on a response to Omar. \u2018People within the caucus are kind of all over the map,\u2019 she said. \u2018There are some people that feel, \u2018Why are we doing a resolution?\u2019 Some people, they want to see what it actually says, and there are some people that feel good about what they are hearing.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- The brouhaha is testing Pelosi\u2019s ability to unify her caucus as it faces multiplying battles against Trump. Paul Kane reports: \u201cPelosi and Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) need to end the tension over Omar to build trust for the legislative battles ahead, or else the individuals involved will almost certainly feel aggrieved and take out their anger on more prominent issues. \u2026 As Pelosi entered the closed-door meeting, she admonished the media for fixating on the Omar controversy. \u2018The press loves to foment unease in the Democratic Party but we are very united,\u2019 she told reporters.\u201d\n\n-- Pelosi told reporters yesterday that she does not think Omar\u2019s comments were \u201cintentionally anti-Semitic.\u201d\n\n-- Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) all raised concerns about the House\u2019s response to Omar. The three presidential candidates condemned anti-Semitism but said there should be more discussion regarding the U.S. and Israel and argued that the way Omar was being thrust into the spotlight puts her at risk. (Politico)\n\nPeople in Mosul, Iraq, carry the bodies of airstrike victims. (Felipe Dana/AP)\n\nTHE NEW WORLD ORDER:\n\n-- The Trump administration revoked part of an Obama-era executive order mandating an annual accounting of how many civilians died in military and CIA strikes. Missy Ryan reports: \u201cThe State Department said the report was redundant because Congress had subsequently passed legislation requiring the Defense Department to provide a separate, more exhaustive annual report on civilian casualties resulting from military activities. \u2026 Rep. Adam B. Schiff (D-Calif.), who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, said there was \u2018simply no justification\u2019 for the move. He said he would seek to make such reporting mandatory through an annual intelligence bill.\u201d\n\n-- American- and British-made bombs may have killed or injured nearly 1,000 civilians in Yemen\u2019s four-year conflict, according to a report released by human rights groups. Sudarsan Raghavan report: \u201cThe airstrikes killed 203 people and injured at least 749, the report found. At least 122 children and 56 women were among the dead and wounded. \u2026 The United States, in particular, has sold billions of dollars in weaponry to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, its key allies in the Middle East. Both nations lead a regional coalition that seeks to oust northern rebels known as Houthis and restore Yemen\u2019s internationally recognized government.\u201d\n\n-- Venezuelan authorities have deported the German ambassador and a detained U.S. journalist after raiding his home, as President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro struggles to maintain control of the nation. Rachelle Krygier and Mary Beth Sheridan report: \u201cThe ambassador, Daniel Kriener, had been among a group of U.S., Latin American and European diplomats who greeted opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3 at Caracas\u2019s airport on Monday as he returned to the country after a 10-day trip abroad, defying warnings he might be arrested. \u2026 Earlier Wednesday, military counterintelligence forces raided the Caracas home of U.S. journalist Cody Weddle and took the Virginia native into custody. They also seized Weddle\u2019s assistant, Venezuelan journalist Carlos Camacho. Weddle and Camacho were released Wednesday evening, and the American journalist was deported.\u201d\n\n-- Staffers at the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh said they were shut out of meetings between Jared Kushner and Saudi Arabia\u2019s royal court last week. From the Daily Beast\u2019s Erin Banco: Kushner \u201cmet with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and King Salman to discuss U.S.-Saudi cooperation, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and economic investment in the region, according to the White House. But no one from the embassy in Riyadh was in the meetings, according to two sources. The State Department did have a senior official in attendance, but he was not part of the State Department team in Saudi. He is a senior member of the department focused on Iran.\u201d\n\n-- Trump is covering for MBS over the death of Jamal Khashoggi, The Post\u2019s Editorial Board writes, and the Senate must push harder for accountability: \u201cIn his zeal to cover for [MBS], who the CIA concluded ordered Khashoggi\u2019s murder, President Trump is defying Congress\u2019s authority under the Global Magnitsky Act, which provides for U.S. action in cases of gross human rights abuses. The law allows legislators to require a finding by the president in specific cases ... The Senate\u2019s view is already clear: It unanimously approved a resolution in December holding the crown prince responsible. Now the question is whether the Senate will act to uphold its authority under the law and prevent the Saudi ruler from escaping accountability for the gruesome murder and dismemberment of a journalist who was a Virginia resident and a contributor to The Post.\u201d\n\n-- According to the U.N., 14 Palestinians have been injured and one has been killed in the West Bank as attacks by Israeli settlers are on the rise. Loveday Morris and Ruth Eglash report: \u201cIsraeli monitoring groups say the surge in settler violence, in part, reflects a lack of Israeli law enforcement and a response to a rash of particularly distressing attacks by Palestinians against Israelis. While the number of Palestinian attacks in the West Bank dropped last year, their severity appeared to increase.\u201d\n\n-- Huawei is suing the U.S. government to challenge a law banning federal agencies from buying its equipment. The suit alleges that the government is unfairly punishing the Chinese company without providing proof that it posed an espionage threat to the country. (Gerry Shih)\n\n-- Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro tweeted a sexually explicit video of a man at a street party during the country\u2019s Carnival celebrations in an attempt to condemn how \u201cvulgar\u201d the event has become. Instead, his judgment in showing the graphic video sparked outrage from supporters and critics. Marina Lopes reports: \u201cThe backlash was swift against Bolsonaro, who has enjoyed considerable support from the country\u2019s right wing, including evangelicals. Several users reported Bolsonaro to Twitter, which prohibits the publication of videos depicting sexual acts. Some users went so far as to demand that the president be impeached for violating a Brazilian law prohibiting officials from \u2018acting in a way that is incompatible with the dignity, honor, and decorum of the office.\u2019\u201d\n\nFox News moderators during the first 2016 Republican presidential debate. (John Minchillo/AP)\n\n2020 WATCH:\n\n-- The Democratic National Committee announced it would not air any of its 2020 primary debates on Fox News, citing the New Yorker report on the network\u2019s close ties to Trump. \u201cI believe that a key pathway to victory is to continue to expand our electorate and reach all voters,\u201d DNC Chairman Tom Perez said in a statement. \u201cThat is why I have made it a priority to talk to a broad array of potential media partners, including Fox News. Recent reporting in the New Yorker on the inappropriate relationship between President Trump, his administration and Fox News has led me to conclude that the network is not in a position to host a fair and neutral debate for our candidates. Therefore, Fox News will not serve as a media partner for the 2020 Democratic primary debates.\u201d\n\nPaul Farhi notes: \u201cWinning the exclusive rights to televise the 12 candidate debates is considered a prestigious prize in the television business. The debates typically draw large audiences \u2014 the first Republican debate in August 2015 attracted a record 24 million viewers \u2014 and are a vehicle for promoting the networks\u2019 news programs. Numerous networks, including Fox, have submitted proposals to the DNC to televise one of the 12 scheduled debates, which will start in June. So far, the organization has only awarded rights to the first two \u2014 to NBC (along with sister networks MSNBC and Telemundo) and to CNN.\u201d\n\n-- Andrew Yang, a little-known Democratic candidate for president, has managed to get 47,000 individual donors. If he reaches 65,000 in the next two months, he will make an appearance in the first primary debate. From the Daily Beast\u2019s Sam Stein and Will Sommer: \u201cHe's already met one threshold\u2014that his campaign have a minimum of 200 donors per state in at least 20 states. And his team says he\u2019s a lock to clear the other. \u2018100 percent. Hell will have to freeze over at this rate for us not to,\u2019 said Zach Graumann, Yang\u2019s campaign manager. \u2018We are averaging 1,500 donors a day. Not averaging, that is our baseline. And people don\u2019t even know who he is yet.\u2019 \u2026 Getting on the debate stage would be a huge coup for Yang, an entrepreneur who is little known outside of tech circles.\u201d\n\n-- Taylor Swift plans to get much more involved in politics in 2020. Her endorsement of Democratic Senate candidate Phil Bredesen didn\u2019t help him get over the top in Tennessee last year, but the pop icon isn\u2019t deterred. With her 30th birthday coming up, she\u2019s written an introspective first-person piece for Elle Magazine about 30 lessons she\u2019s learned in life so far. This jumps out: \u201cI learned how to make some easy cocktails like Pimm\u2019s cups, Aperol spritzes, Old-Fashioneds, and Mojitos because\u20262016,\u201d Swift writes. \u201cI\u2019m finding my voice in terms of politics. I took a lot of time educating myself on the political system and the branches of government that are signing off on bills that affect our day-to-day life. I saw so many issues that put our most vulnerable citizens at risk, and felt like I had to speak up to try and help make a change. Only as someone approaching 30 did I feel informed enough to speak about it to my 114 million followers. Invoking racism and provoking fear through thinly veiled messaging is not what I want from our leaders, and I realized that it actually is my responsibility to use my influence against that disgusting rhetoric. I\u2019m going to do more to help. We have a big race coming up next year.\u201d\n\n-- Joe Biden has brought on the president of the Latino Victory Fund to aid his likely presidential campaign. Crist\u00f3bal Alex, who served as Hillary Clinton\u2019s national deputy director of voter outreach and mobilization in 2016, tweeted about his departure from the liberal group but did not specify what role he would take on next. \u201cI am committed to doing everything in my power to defeat him, and my next steps will reflect that,\u201d he wrote. (Politico)\n\n-- Biden\u2019s potential presidential campaign is already taking shape, and Democrats are impatient. The former vice president\u2019s advisers have begun offering campaign positions to strategists and are eyeing setting their headquarters in Delaware or Philadelphia for a possible April launch date. The New York Times\u2019s Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns report: \u201cBiden has also been privately reaching out to a range of influential Democrats, including party donors, members of Congress and allies in the early primary states, to gauge their support. \u2026 Still, in conversations over the phone and strategy sessions in his rented Northern Virginia home \u2026 Biden has acknowledged that he is uncertain about his place in the 2020 Democratic primary. He is also uneasy about potential attacks from rivals on his family, aides and advisers say \u2026 Prominent Democrats from the early nominating states say Mr. Biden must move soon. \u2018He has a lot of good will in this state,\u2019 said Gilda Cobb-Hunter, a longtime South Carolina lawmaker. \u2018But if he\u2019s going to get in he needs to get in. I think the window is closing.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Bernie Sanders plans to maintain his 2016 campaign promise to not air \u201cpersonal attack ads.\u201d BuzzFeed News\u2019s Ruby Cramer reports: \u201cWhen the Vermont senator jumped in the last Democratic primary in May 2015, during a press conference in Washington, he told reporters he'd \u2018never\u2019 run a negative ad in his career. \u2026 Still, in the statement provided Wednesday, the Sanders campaign indicated an openness to ads that \u2018discuss differences he has on the issues.\u2019 Asked if Sanders would renounce negative ads across the board as he had in his last campaign, an aide referred again to the statement.\u201d\n\n-- The Democratic super PAC Priorities USA released a report on its 2020 targets that placed historically red states such as Arizona and Georgia ahead of the traditional bellwether state of Ohio. The Cleveland Plain Dealer\u2019s Seth A. Richardson reports: \u201cThe Buckeye State is also notably absent from the super PAC\u2019s $100 million early engagement program planned for Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Florida. A second phase without a dollar amount attached will include Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina and New Hampshire.\u201d The group\u2019s spokesman added that he still thinks Ohio is \u201cwinnable\u201d for a Democrat. \u201cWhat we think that means is if Ohio is in play, we\u2019ll have already won the easier states and have 270 electoral votes,\u201d he said.\n\n-- Polling has shown that Democrats and Republicans have radically different opinions and definitions of socialism. Younger people and Democrats are more likely to have a positive view of socialism, for example. But, as Democratic strategist Mark Mellman writes for the Hill, \u201cuncertainty also comes into play. Asked by Gallup to define socialism, the largest number of respondents \u2014 about a quarter of both Democrats and Republicans \u2014 said it meant equality. Another 13 percent of Democrats, but only 7 percent of Republicans, saw it as government services, like free health care. About 6 percent believe socialism means being social, including activity on social media.\u201d\n\n-- The GOP flipped a state legislature seat in Kentucky, bringing its total count of state assembly seats flipped nationally to four. Democrats have flipped zero. The flipped seats include two in Connecticut, one of which had belonged to Democrats for over 25 years. (The Hill)\n\n-- The House Oversight Committee is launching an investigation into alleged voter suppression last November in Georgia, where Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp eked out a victory over Democrat Stacey Abrams. Felicia Sonmez and Vanessa Williams report: \u201cThe oversight panel\u2019s chairman, Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), and civil rights subcommittee chairman, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.), said in letters to Kemp and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger on Wednesday that they are \u2018investigating recent reports of serious problems with voter registration, voter access, and other matters affecting the ability of people in Georgia to exercise their right to vote.\u2019 \u2026 Cummings and Raskin made a sweeping request for documents related to the election, giving Kemp and Raffensperger a deadline of March 20.\u201d\n\nThen-San Francisco District Attorney Kamala Harris fields questions on an investigation into alleged evidence tampering in the city's crime lab. (Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP)\n\nKNOWING KAMALA:\n\n-- When Kamala Harris was San Francisco\u2019s top prosecutor, a crime lab scandal nearly ended her run for California attorney general. Harris failed to inform a judge that a lab technician brought home cocaine from the lab, potentially tainting hundreds of cases, and was becoming an unreliable witness for the prosecution. Michael Kranish reports: \u201cWith the local criminal-justice system at risk of devolving into chaos, Harris took the extraordinary step of dismissing about 1,000 drug-related cases, including many in which convictions had been obtained and sentences were being served. \u2026 A review of the case, based on court records and interviews with key players, presents a portrait of Harris scrambling to manage a crisis that her staff saw coming but for which she was unprepared.\u201d\n\nOne of the most involved players in the case was Harris\u2019s law school friend Jeff Adachi, the city\u2019s public defender, who before dying last month told The Post that Harris was \u201cslow to respond\u201d to the controversy: \u201cSome of the attorneys in Harris\u2019s office \u2018knew it was a problem and never informed us, the defense, that there was a problem with this.\u2019 \u2026 The scandal escalated further when Adachi questioned whether Harris had also failed in separate cases to reveal the names of police officers who had been convicted or found to have committed misconduct. ...Harris said at the time that Adachi was \u2018playing politics with public safety.\u2019 She said in the Post interview that the police had legitimate privacy concerns.\u201d\u201d\n\n-- Harris\u2019s relationship with Adachi, who was her law school friend and tutor, suffered because of the scandal. Michael Kranish reports: \u201cThe fight was, on one level, an example of a prosecutor and defense attorney playing their respective roles. But it was all the more extraordinary because the two had been friends for years. \u2026 He as a public defender and she as a prosecutor. \u2026 They continued as adversaries and friends, often talking to each other about cases, and seeking support from the same set of voters.\u201d\n\nWhen Harris sought Adachi\u2019s support for her presidential candidacy earlier this year, Adachi said he wasn\u2019t quite ready. The two friends then had an emotional call in which Adachi seemed open to the idea of potentially becoming a campaign adviser. However, eight days later, on Feb. 22, the San Francisco public defender died.\n\nTHE #METOO MOVEMENT:\n\n-- Sen. Martha McSally revealed she was raped by a superior officer while serving in the Air Force. Felicia Sonmez reports: \u201cMcSally (R-Ariz.), the country\u2019s first female fighter pilot to fly in combat, made the revelation during a hearing on preventing sexual assault in the military. \u2018Like you, I am also a military sexual assault survivor,\u2019 McSally said, addressing several witnesses set to testify at the hearing about their own assaults while serving in the military. \u2018But unlike so many brave survivors, I didn\u2019t report being sexually assaulted. Like so many women and men, I didn\u2019t trust the system at the time.\u2019 McSally told the panel that she blamed herself, was \u2018ashamed and confused,\u2019 and felt powerless about what happened to her. \u2018The perpetrators abused their position of power in profound ways,\u2019 she said. \u2018In one case, I was preyed upon and raped by a superior officer.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Musician R. Kelly erupted in anger about the sexual abuse allegations against him in his first interview since he was arrested. Elahe Izadi reports: \u201cDuring the segment that aired Wednesday, [CBS News\u2019s] Gayle King pressed him on the allegations made by dozens of people who were interviewed in a widely watched Lifetime docuseries. \u2026 \u2018Everybody says something bad about me,\u2019 Kelly said of the series. \u2018Nobody said nothing good. They were describing Lucifer. I\u2019m not Lucifer, I\u2019m a man. I make mistakes, but I\u2019m not a devil, and by no means am I a monster.\u2019 Kelly called claims that he held women against their will \u2018stupid\u2019 and said that \u2018the power of social media\u2019 was to blame. \u2018I have been assassinated. I have been buried alive,\u2019 he said. Then he erupted. \u2026 King tried to interject, but Kelly stood up, screaming and pounding his fists. \u2018Stop it! Y\u2019all quit playing! Quit playing! I didn\u2019t do this stuff! This is not me! \u2026 Y\u2019all trying to kill me!\u2019 he said.\u201d\n\n-- A conservative local judge in Alabama has allowed a man to go forward with a lawsuit against the manufacturer of the pill his girlfriend used to end a pregnancy and the clinic that gave it to her on behalf of the aborted fetus. Madison County Probate Judge Frank Barger decreed that \u201cBaby Roe\u201d is a person in allowing the plaintiff, Ryan Magers, to sue the two parties for \u201cwrongful death.\u201d (Ariana Eunjung Cha and Emily Wax-Thibodeaux)\n\n-- Mario Batali has sold his shares in his company a year after sexual misconduct allegations emerged against the celebrity chef. The New York Times\u2019s Julia Moskin reports: \u201cMr. Batali \u2018will no longer profit from the restaurants in any way, shape or form,\u2019 said Tanya Bastianich Manuali, who will head day-to-day operations at a new company, as yet unnamed, created to replace the Batali & Bastianich Hospitality Group. The new company will operate the group\u2019s remaining 16 restaurants under a new management and financial structure. Mrs. Bastianich Manuali and her brother, Joe Bastianich, have bought Mr. Batali\u2019s shares in all the restaurants. \u2026 Mr. Batali is also selling his shares in Eataly, the fast-growing global chain of luxury Italian supermarkets.\u201d\n\n-- London fans of Michael Jackson gathered to defend the pop star and protest a documentary on sexual abuse allegations against him. Jennifer Hassan reports: \u201cGathering outside the headquarters of British TV network Channel 4, the channel on which the documentary will be aired Wednesday and Thursday, a group of fans clutched photos and chanted in unison: \u2018Facts don\u2019t lie, people do.\u2019 A few were dressed as Jackson, wearing sunglasses and sequined hats. Others held signs that read \u2018Michael Jackson Innocent\u2019 and \u2018More records than any other artist, son, husband, father.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Two teenagers who started a feminist club at their all-boys high school will attend the U.N. Commission on the Status of Women later this month. Matias Benitez and Matt Chen have hosted standing-room-only meetings during their lunch period since starting the club last year, less than a week before the Harvey Weinstein story broke. (Samantha Schmidt)\n\nTHE TRUMP ECONOMY:\n\n-- \u201cThe luxury real estate market in Manhattan is sagging. The GOP tax law is hitting real estate markets across the nation. And signs of stress across the broader housing market suggest the industry which made Trump rich \u2026 could also be one that slows his economy and dents his chances at a second term,\u201d Politico\u2019s Ben White and Katy O\u2019Donnell report. \u201cThe housing market may not cause the next recession like it did in 2008. But weakness in the construction of new homes, sales of existing homes and affordability for millennials looking to buy for the first time could contribute to a recession arriving as soon as next year or prolong any downturn. In addition to 2008, declines in the housing market were tied to recessions in 1974, 1980 and 1990-91, raising concerns that history is about to repeat. \u2026\n\n\u201cOne area where housing-market stress is obvious is the one Trump knows best: High-end apartments in Manhattan, where prices are now dropping as foreign buyers disappear and wealthy residents flee to lower-tax states. Trump\u2019s New York home is not the only blue state where the housing market has taken a hit following the tax law changes. Markets are also suffering across the Northeast, where sales of new homes dropped 16.1 percent in December, according to brokerage firm Redfin.\u201d\n\n-- Despite the president's campaign promises, the U.S. merchandise trade deficit hit a record high of $891.2 billion last year. David J. Lynch reports: \u201cThe trade gap with China also hit a record $419 billion, underscoring the stakes for the president\u2019s bid to reach a deal with Chinese President Xi Jinping as soon as this month. The [Commerce Department\u2019s] final 2018 trade report, which was delayed by the partial government shutdown, showed that the United States bought far more in foreign goods than it sold to customers in Africa, Asia, Europe and North America. The shortfall topped the 2006 record of $838.3 billion, set as the housing bubble was peaking, and marked the third consecutive year of rising deficits.\u201d\n\n-- U.S. and European officials appear to be far from a trade deal, contrary to public statements last July from Trump and the European Commission president. The New York Times\u2019s Ana Swanson and Jack Ewing report: \u201cTrump administration officials insist that any deal must address the agricultural trade barriers that the president says put American farmers at a disadvantage, in part because such an agreement would be more likely to win congressional approval. European officials counter that agriculture was never on the table \u2014 not last July, and not now.\u201d\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\n\nTrump suggested no general election debates should be aired on networks whose news coverage he has criticized after the DNC ended its media partnership with Fox:\n\nDemocrats just blocked @FoxNews from holding a debate.

The problem: mass quantities of dirty, worn-out clothes, ugly trinkets and unsellable appliances. Even oddities like pornography and swords. \u2018We love donations because it\u2019s a thriving part of our business,\u2019 said David Braddon, a senior district sales manager for Goodwill in Houston.

No one knows what will happen if Britain crashes out of the EU in 24 days; as of today, there is no plan. I laughed at the Y2K preppers, stockpiling canned goods and batteries in anticipation of computers failing to cope with the year 2000.

The bill moved forward without any discussion, even though it has both strong support and strong opposition in the Democratic-majority House to make Maryland the seventh state to allow patients to get help in ending their own lives. ... Public support for such measures has grown. A recent Goucher College poll found that 6 in 10 Maryland residents favor allowing doctors to prescribe a lethal dose of medicine to terminally ill patients. ... The bill would apply only to terminally ill people who doctors say have less than six months to live. A patient would have to make three requests, both oral and written, to end his or her life, with waiting periods and the ability to rescind the request at any time.\u201d\n\n-- D.C.

    "description": "Tribalism means neither side is giving any ground.",
    "text": "With Joanie Greve and Mariana Alfaro\n\nTHE BIG IDEA: President Trump threw around words like \u201cevil\u201d and \u201ctreasonous\u201d on Monday as he lashed out at his critics while celebrating Attorney General William Barr\u2019s summary of Bob Mueller\u2019s report.\n\nHe and his aides showed little interest in striving for national healing or reconciliation in the wake of seemingly good news from the special counsel. Instead, they looked for ways to seek payback and to weaponize Barr\u2019s letter as a partisan cudgel.\n\n\u201cA lot of people out there that have done some very, very evil things, very bad things,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office. \u201cI would say treasonous things against our country.\u201d\n\nThis speaks volumes about Trump\u2019s worldview \u2014 counterpunching is his default move \u2014 but it also foreshadows the nastiness that will likely occupy the 19 months between now and the 2020 election.\n\nTrump might be squandering a key moment to take the high road after Mueller\u2019s two-year probe didn\u2019t establish collusion between his 2016 campaign and the Russians. But there\u2019s also little indication that Democratic leaders would accept an olive branch if the president extended one. They view him with visceral disdain and are focused on defeating him at the ballot box next year. Either way, rather than break the partisan fever, the still-confidential Mueller report seems to be bogging down the parties in trench warfare and underscoring the depths of tribalism.\n\n-- Ashley Parker and Josh Dawsey report that the Trump operation is formulating a strategy to seek vengeance against critics: \u201cBarr made it clear that the special counsel was not exonerating the president on the question of obstruction of justice. And details of the report, if made public, could prove troublesome for Trump. Still, the president\u2019s aides and allies have shown little desire to turn the page, preferring to write a new book detailing what they say is a rush to judgment from a Washington establishment unwilling to ever give Trump an unbiased assessment.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is not something to put behind us and move on,\u201d said David Bossie, Trump\u2019s 2016 deputy campaign manager.\n\n\u201cWhat he says is, he wants this investigated,\u201d Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani said of the president.\n\nAnother adviser who talked to the president also said Trump has an appetite to see his critics investigated.\n\n-- Trump\u2019s allies in Congress and on cable gleefully jumped on the investigate-the-investigators bandwagon. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who spent the weekend golfing with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, held a news conference to announce that the Senate Judiciary Committee he chairs will launch an investigation into what he called \u201call of the abuse by the Department of Justice and the FBI\u201d during the 2016 election.\n\n\u201cTime to investigate the Obama officials who concocted and spread the Russian conspiracy hoax,\u201d tweeted Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), another Trump golfing buddy, who has previously downplayed Russian interference in the 2016 election and even traveled to Moscow last summer.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark.) accused senior officials at the FBI and the National Security Division of the Justice Department of trying to \u201csabotage the transition of power to the Trump administration.\u201d \u201cAt the top, in Washington, at the leadership level, it appears that there is a serious cultural problem in some of these organizations,\u201d he told radio host Hugh Hewitt this morning. \u201cThere needs to be an accounting of that.\u201d\n\nRep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) lost to Roy Moore in the 2017 GOP primary for the Senate seat that had belonged to Jeff Sessions until he stepped down to become Trump\u2019s attorney general. As Brooks mulls a 2020 challenge against Sen. Doug Jones (D), who beat Moore in the general, he\u2019s been working to demonstrate fealty to Trump to lock down activist support. Against that backdrop, Brooks took to the House floor yesterday to liken Democrats to Adolf Hitler and read from \u201cMein Kampf.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor more than two years, Socialist Democrats and their fake news media allies \u2026 have perpetrated the biggest political lie, con, scam and fraud in American history,\u201d Brooks said on the floor, according to the Birmingham News. \u201cThe accusations of collusion between President Trump and Russia in the 2016 elections are nothing but a \u2018Big Lie.\u2019 \u2026 America must reject their 'Big Lies\u2019 or succumb to the danger that lurks and the horrific damage that results.\u201d\n\nFox News host Sean Hannity pledged to his followers, \u201cWe will hold every deep state official who abused power accountable. We will hold every fake news media liar accountable. We will hold every liar in Congress accountable.\u201d\n\nWhite House counselor Kellyanne Conway even called on House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) \u2014 a frequent Trump critic on cable \u2014 to resign his seat, and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) urged him to relinquish his chairmanship.\n\n-- Mueller notified Barr and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein on March 5, three weeks ago, that he would not offer a definitive conclusion on whether Trump sought to obstruct justice. \u201cThe decision \u2014 which a Justice Department official on Monday said the special counsel\u2019s office came to \u2018entirely\u2019 on its own \u2014 left a gap ripe for political exploitation,\u201d per Matt Zapotosky, Devlin Barrett, Carol Leonnig and John Wagner. After accepting the report, Barr and Rosenstein \u201cmade the call Mueller would not, determining that the evidence was insufficient to allege that Trump had obstructed justice. The decisive maneuver \u2026 sparked allegations that the two Trump appointees had rushed to a judgment no one asked them to make.\u201d\n\n-- The Democratic chairs of six House committees, including Schiff, sent a letter last night asking Barr to provide them with a copy of the full Mueller report, as well as its underlying evidence, \u201cno later than Tuesday, April 2.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cSpeaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and members of her leadership team agreed in a Monday night huddle that the caucus needs to stop talking about collusion with Russia because it was distracting from their legislative agenda, according to three people in the meeting or familiar with the discussion,\u201d per Rachael Bade, Karoun Demirjian and Paul Kane. \u201cNotably, two Democrats in the room who brought up concerns about the nationwide focus on their high-profile probes \u2014 Rep. David N. Cicilline (D-R.I.) and House Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairwoman Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.) \u2014 are from opposite sides of the caucus: one a liberal, the other from a Trump district. Both argued that the House needs to megaphone pocketbook issues that won them the majority.\n\n\u201cDuring a Sunday afternoon phone call with Pelosi and House committee chairs, Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) argued that Barr, rather than Mueller, should be their most immediate target \u2026 Some House Democrats on the Judiciary Committee had been pushing to call Mueller to the Hill first. But Nadler insisted that because it was Barr\u2019s decision to forgo obstruction charges, he should be their first priority.\u201d\n\n-- The House Appropriations Committee has a tentative hearing already scheduled for April 9 to review the Justice Department\u2019s budget request, at which any attorney general would customarily appear, but other committees may seek Barr\u2019s appearance before then.\n\n-- On the Senate side, meanwhile, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) blocked an effort last night by Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) to force an up-or-down vote on the resolution urging the Justice Department to release the Mueller report. It passed the House unanimously earlier this month.\n\n-- The toxic tribalism that\u2019s been tearing apart the country\u2019s civic culture has been on display over the past 36 hours.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t all seem to agree that it\u2019s a good thing the president didn\u2019t conspire with Russia, nor can we all admit that the Kremlin may have helped elect Trump,\u201d laments Politico editor in chief John Harris. \u201cForty-five years ago, after Watergate resulted in Richard Nixon\u2019s resignation, even Republicans joined in the ritual sermonizing about how the episode proved the primacy of law. No doubt even in those days there was ample pretense beneath the piety\u2014of course Democrats were gloating and Republicans were plotting payback. But the very fact that they bothered to pretend revealed a basic respect that American political culture was on the level.\n\n\u201cThese days, the one point on which warring sides all seem to agree is that American political culture in the Trump era is fundamentally not on the level. The Trump-Russia episode proves the primacy not of law or even of politics, both of which are designed to reconcile conflicting values and lead to resolution. It shows the primacy of psychology, in which current events represent a nonstop Rorschach test \u2014 what does it look like to you? \u2014 and virtually no factual assertion can be embraced at face value. In this prism, the main purpose of argument is to show fidelity to the home team, and not to settle a matter but to keep it going.\u201d\n\n-- Polling shows that many people have already made up their minds on Trump and Russia, and new information cannot change how they think. Trump famously said he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and his supporters would stick with him. A Fox News poll conducted last week, before Mueller wrapped up his investigation, found that 4 in 10 Americans said there was \u201cno chance\u201d that anything in the report could change their minds. \u201cAmong those who voted for Clinton in 2016, fully half said that nothing in Mueller\u2019s findings would change their minds \u2014 presumably including complete exoneration. Among Trump voters, 4 in 10 said the same thing,\u201d Philip Bump notes. \u201cMore Republicans and Trump voters said there was at least a small chance that their minds might be changed than did Democrats. But across the board, 7 in 10 respondents said that, at most, there was only a small chance that their minds would be changed about Trump.\u201d\n\n-- Monday brought other reminders that the various investigations into Trump, his orbit and Russia\u2019s role in the 2016 election are not actually over.\n\nThe Supreme Court announced that it would not review a lower-court order requiring an unnamed foreign-owned corporation to comply with a subpoena from Mueller. \u201cAs is customary, the court did not give a reason for turning down the company\u2019s appeal, nor were there noted dissents,\u201d Bob Barnes reports. \u201cThe entity that is the subject of the cloaked legal battle \u2014 known in court papers simply as a \u2018Corporation\u2019 from \u2018Country A\u2019 \u2014 is a foreign financial institution that was issued a subpoena by a grand jury hearing evidence in the special counsel investigation. It is thought to be the first time an aspect of Mueller\u2019s wide-ranging probe into Russian interference in the 2016 campaign has reached the Supreme Court. \u2026 It is unclear if [Mueller] or other prosecutors will pursue the information his subpoena sought. The grand jury remains empaneled.\u201d\n\nThe House Intelligence Committee last night announced the indefinite postponement of a Wednesday hearing at which Trump\u2019s former business associate Felix Sater had agreed to testify. Schiff said he first wants to hear from senior DOJ and FBI officials, as well as people involved in the special counsel probe. Sater, a Soviet-born felon, was accused in a lawsuit yesterday of plotting to use Trump-branded skyscrapers to launder money allegedly stolen from a Kazakhstan bank. BTA Bank and the city of Almaty, Kazakhstan, alleged that Sater conspired to use some of their $440 million to develop a Trump Tower in Moscow. Sater didn\u2019t respond to the AP\u2019s request for comment.\n\n-- Another potential flash point to keep an eye on: Trump is not ruling out pardons now that Mueller has wrapped up. Some Trump allies have been urging him publicly and privately to issue pardons soon, particularly for former national security adviser Michael Flynn, Roz Helderman reports: \u201cOn Monday, a lawyer for George Papadopoulos, a former campaign aide to Trump who served 12 days in prison for lying to the FBI in the Russia investigation, said she has already submitted an application to the White House requesting a pardon. \u2018It would be malpractice not to,\u2019 said Caroline Polisi, Papadopoulos\u2019s attorney.\u201d He\u2019s one of five Trump associates who pleaded guilty to crimes as part of the special counsel\u2019s investigation. A sixth, longtime Trump confidant Roger Stone, is scheduled to go on trial in November.\n\nThe president has reveled in his constitutional ability to issue pardons, handing them out to right-wing compatriots like Joe Arpaio, Dinesh D\u2019Souza and Scooter Libby. Asked yesterday about pardoning his associates whom Mueller prosecuted, however, Trump demurred. \u201cI haven\u2019t thought about it,\u201d he said.\n\n-- Looking ahead to the 2020 campaign, the Mueller investigation specifically and the Russia scandal generally have gotten much less attention from regular people than you might think from watching television. From CNN:\n\nI just check with @jennagiesta on this. CNN's last poll asked \"In your own words, please tell me what 1 issue will be most important to you in deciding whom to support in next year\u2019s prez election?\" 0 (!) respondents said the Russian/Mueller investigation. https://t.co/j4fNwjF7fU \u2014 (((Harry Enten))) (@ForecasterEnten) March 25, 2019\n\n-- Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld said the Mueller report hasn\u2019t altered his calculus about challenging Trump in the Republican primaries next year. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really counting on the president getting caught in the soup,\u201d he said at an event in Concord, N.H., per the AP.\n\n-- Democrats running for president see an opening \u201cto focus anew on matters that many of them have argued are more critical to winning back swing voters than the findings of any investigation,\u201d Bob Costa and Sean Sullivan report. \u201cSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) once again urged \u2018multibillion dollar companies\u2019 to offer higher wages. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee (D) underscored his calls to address global climate change. Sen. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) put an emphasis on her plan to boost teacher salaries and to curb the rising cost of prescription drugs. \u2026 Over the weekend, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) held three town halls across northern New Hampshire, taking 25 questions from voters. None of them asked about the Mueller findings. After an event in Conway ended without a Russia question, Warren cited \u2018a huge disconnect between Washington and the rest of America.\u2019\u201d\n\nWith Trump looking better positioned for reelection this week than he did last week, electability may begin to matter more to the Democratic rank and file. David Axelrod, the former chief strategist for Barack Obama, told Bob and Sean that there\u2019s a \u201cbig market out there for decency.\u201d He thinks Beto O\u2019Rourke, Mayor Pete Buttigieg and Cory Booker stand to gain the most if Democrats put more of an emphasis on temperament. \u201cRegardless of the report, Trump\u2019s disdain for norms and people is part of who he is, and the latest developments are unlikely to make him more reflective or humble,\u201d he said. \u201cWho will speak to that?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a case of slap anybody on the ballot and that person is going to win. We have to look for our most electable candidate,\u201d said Ed Rendell, the former Democratic National Committee chairman and Pennsylvania governor.\n\n\u201cHanging the entire nomination, or the election, on an anti-Trump message, I don\u2019t believe is a winning message or a winning strategy,\u201d said Stephen Benjamin, the Democratic mayor of Columbia, S.C., who is neutral in the primary. \u201cI would caution anyone seeking the nomination to not put all their eggs in an anti-Trump basket.\u201d\n\n-- Finally, the 2020 election remains vulnerable to Russian interference. The Post\u2019s Editorial Board warns that perhaps the most important point in Barr\u2019s letter is being overlooked in the political squabbling: \u201cThe country was attacked during the 2016 presidential election, and the nation\u2019s leaders must work to prevent another such attack in 2020. \u2026 National security experts have warned again and again that Russia has not been deterred from engaging in more mischief during next year\u2019s presidential race.\u201d\n\n-- First look: The group Republicans for the Rule of Law is going up with a new commercial calling for the release of the Mueller report.

(Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images)\n\n-- In a significant shift that could have greater 2020 implications than the Mueller report, the Trump administration said it now backs a full repeal of the Affordable Care Act. Isaac Stanley-Becker reports: The Justice Department \u201cdivulged its position in a legal filing Monday with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, where an appeal is pending in a case challenging the measure\u2019s constitutionality. A federal judge in Texas ruled in December that the law\u2019s individual mandate \u2018can no longer be sustained as an exercise of Congress\u2019s tax power\u2019 and further found that the remaining portions of the law are invalid. He based his judgment on changes to the nation\u2019s tax laws made by congressional Republicans the previous year.\n\n\u201cPreviously, the Trump administration had not gone as far, arguing in a brief last June that the penalty for not buying insurance could be distinguished from other provisions of the law, which could still stand. \u2026 But in the new filing, signed by three Justice Department attorneys, the administration said that the decision of U.S. District Judge Reed O\u2019Connor should be affirmed and the entirety of the ACA should be invalidated. \u2026 If it were successful, the Justice Department\u2019s position supporting the judge\u2019s ruling would potentially eliminate health care for millions of people and create widespread disruption across the U.S. health-care system \u2014 from removing no-charge preventive services for older Americans on Medicare to voiding the expansion of Medicaid in most states.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis refutes any notion that people might have that Attorney General Barr would retreat from some of the most partisan litigation choices made by the previous attorney general,\u201d said Nicholas Bagley, a professor of law at the University of Michigan, referring to Jeff Sessions.\n\n-- Democrats pounced:\n\nTonight in federal court, the Trump Admin declared all out war on affordable, dependable health care.

Most of the money will fund a new center for research, education and treatment of addiction and pain at Oklahoma State University in Tulsa. Oklahoma is free to continue its lawsuit against two other defendants and their subsidiaries \u2014 Johnson & Johnson, the 37th-largest company in the United States, and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, an Israel-based manufacturer that focuses mainly on generic drugs.

(Jeff Chiu/AP)\n\n-- Former president Barack Obama warned a group of freshman House Democrats last night to think more about the costs of their liberal ideas because, he said, voters care about price tags. Rachael Bade reports: \u201cObama didn\u2019t name specific policies. And to be sure, he encouraged the lawmakers \u2014 about half-dozen of whom worked in his own administration \u2014 to continue to pursue \u2018bold\u2019 ideas as they shaped legislation during their first year in the House. But some people in the room took his words as a cautionary note about Medicare-for-All and the ambitious Green New Deal, two liberal ideas popularized by a few of the more famous House freshmen, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.). \u2026 People in the room, who asked for anonymity to describe the evening, said Obama\u2019s cost warnings weren\u2019t deficit-scolding, per se. Rather he argued that voters care about the costs associated with policies and that Democrats should be ready to answer questions about how they will pay for an idea while making big promises to constituents.\n\n\u201cHe told them to work across the aisle but also warned against becoming trapped by 'phony bipartisanship,' as one person described his remarks. ... Obama also gave the freshmen some advice: Find the policy you\u2019re willing to lose your seat over and fight for it. The Affordable Care Act was that policy for him as well as a handful of Democrats who took the vote knowing it would cost them their seats. They don\u2019t regret that, he said, after millions of people got health insurance. Or, at least, he certainly didn\u2019t.\"\n\nThe sun sets behind Georgia Power's coal-fired Plant Scherer, one of the nation's top carbon dioxide emitters, in Juliette, Ga.

Rivera Pichardo for The Washington Post)\n\nIF YOU READ ONE STORY TODAY:\n\n-- \u201cPuerto Rico faces food-stamp crisis as Trump privately vents about federal aid to Hurricane Maria-battered island,\u201d by Jeff Stein and Josh Dawsey: \u201cAt the Casa Ismael clinic for HIV-positive men with severe health complications, the staff used to immediately change patients\u2019 diapers after they were soiled. But last week, clinic administrator Myrna Izquierdo told the nurses that had to stop. To save money, the nonprofit clinic, which relies on its patients\u2019 food-stamp money for funding, will ask patients to sit in diapers in which they have repeatedly urinated, sometimes for hours. The Casa Ismael clinic is short on funds in part because of cuts in food stamps that hit about 1.3 million residents of Puerto Rico this month \u2014 a new crisis for an island still struggling from the effects of Hurricane Maria in September 2017. \u2026 Now, about 43 percent of Puerto Rico\u2019s residents are grappling with a sudden cut to a benefit they rely on for groceries and other essentials. \u2026\n\n\u201cAfter initially vowing to reject the food-stamp funding, President Trump has agreed to the emergency request to help Senate Republicans pass a broader disaster-relief package, which may be taken up for a vote this week. But at an Oval Office meeting on Feb. 22, Trump asked top advisers for ways to limit federal support from going to Puerto Rico, believing it is taking money that should be going to the mainland, according to senior administration officials ... Trump has also privately signaled he will not approve any additional help for Puerto Rico beyond the food-stamp money, setting up a congressional showdown with Democrats who have pushed for more expansive help for the island.\n\n\u201cA senior administration official with direct knowledge of the meeting described Trump\u2019s stance: \u2018He doesn\u2019t want another single dollar going to the island.\u2019 \u2026 He has occasionally groused about how ungrateful political officials in Puerto Rico were for the administration\u2019s help, the official said. \u2026 Current and former officials say Trump often complains in meetings that Puerto Rico does not even know how to spend the money the island has been allocated. \u2026 Additionally, Trump administration officials who defended the island \u2014 Tom Bossert, the former homeland security adviser, and Pam Patenaude, the former deputy HUD secretary \u2014 are no longer in the administration. Mick Mulvaney, Trump\u2019s acting chief of staff, has also been critical of how the island has spent its money.\n\n-- It apparently requires repeating: Puerto Ricans are Americans.

(Aaron P. Bernstein/Bloomberg News)\n\nALL THE PRESIDENT\u2019S MEN:\n\n-- Vice President Pence talked Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats out of quitting and persuaded Trump not to fire him. In the past two years, Trump, among other things, has demanded that Coats prove that Obama wiretapped him and accused Coats of leaking classified information, NBC News's Carol Lee and Courtney Kube report. \u201cBut the tipping point for Coats came in December with Trump's abrupt decision to withdraw all U.S. troops from Syria, and the contentious departure of former Defense Secretary James Mattis after protesting the policy, according to the current and former officials. The vice president, who has repeatedly played the role of envoy between Trump and Coats, convinced his long-time Indiana friend to stay until at least this summer. ... Officials said the dynamic between Trump and Coats has stabilized for now. Yet they note that Trump could decide the date of Coats's departure at any time.\u201d\n\n-- Separately, the vice president attacked Democrats who have been critical of the U.S. relationship with Israel during a speech yesterday at AIPAC\u2019s annual conference.

Israel\u2019s military said it struck three targets: the home of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, a building that served as a secret headquarters for Hamas military intelligence and a five-story internal security office in the Rimal neighborhood of Gaza City. Palestinian heath authorities in Gaza did not report fatalities but said seven people were injured. \u2026\n\n\u201cThe escalation comes just two weeks before Israel\u2019s April 9 elections, presenting [Benjamin] Netanyahu with a delicate situation. \u2026 Israeli commentators said that if the prime minister agreed to a cease-fire, it would probably hurt his campaign. \u2026 The violence overshadowed Trump\u2019s signing of an official proclamation recognizing Israeli sovereignty of the Golan Heights, considered by much of the international community to be illegally occupied by Israel since the 1967 war.\u201d\n\n-- Syrians who were once loyal to President Bashar al-Assad are increasingly turning against his government as living standards in the country continue to deteriorate. Liz Sly reports: \u201cFor the first time, those living in the pro-government areas that were spared the worst of the violence are experiencing some of the harshest deprivations, including in the capital, Damascus. Residents there say life has become more difficult in recent months than at any point in the past eight years, bringing a realization that there will be no swift recovery from the immense damage inflicted by the war on Syria\u2019s economy, social fabric and standing in the international community. \u2026 The unhappiness is reflected in an unprecedented torrent of complaints on social media by Assad loyalists, including some of the celebrities and television personalities who have used their stature in the past to rally support for his regime.\u201d\n\n-- The House of Commons voted to wrest control of the Brexit timeline from Prime Minister Theresa May\u2019s government. The AP\u2019s Jill Lawless and Lorne Cook report: \u201cThe move came after May conceded that Parliament would defeat her twice-rejected divorce deal with the EU again if she put it to a third vote. With Brexit delayed and the new departure date up in the air, the House of Commons voted to give itself temporary control of the parliamentary timetable starting on Wednesday so lawmakers can vote on alternatives to May\u2019s withdrawal deal. The government usually controls the scheduling of votes in Parliament. Lawmakers who backed Monday\u2019s motion, which passed 329-302, hope the planned \u2018indicative votes\u2019 will narrow the options down to one that can secure majority support. Possible options include a \u2018soft Brexit\u2019 that maintains close economic ties with the EU or scrapping Britain\u2019s departure altogether.\u201d\n\n-- The European Commission announced that it is prepared for the possibility that Britain crashes out of the E.U. without a deal, which seems increasingly likely as British lawmakers appear no closer to an agreement. British news outlets are also reporting that cabinet members are pushing to oust May. Emily Tamkin reports: \u201c\u2018While a \u2018no-deal\u2019 scenario is not desirable, the EU is prepared for it,\u2019 the commission\u2019s statement said.\u201d\n\n-- Despite the disastrous state of Brexit, British citizens appear to be mesmerized by the United Kingdom\u2019s clumsy efforts to leave the E.U. William Booth and Karla Adam report: \u201cIt\u2019s not an exaggeration to say that ordinary people hurry home to watch Parliament TV in the evening. The streaming service \u2014 Britain\u2019s low-rent C-Span \u2014 is posting record-breaking numbers, for a seemingly endless number of \u2018non-binding\u2019 votes.

From the AP\u2019s Baba Ahmed: \u201cSuspicion immediately fell on the group after Saturday\u2019s massacre in Ogossagou, an ethnic Peuhl village in central Mali. Graphic video after the attack showed bodies burned inside homes with some wreckage still on fire. At one point the body of a young boy in a football jersey can be seen. [Youssouf] Toloba maintained in an interview with The Associated Press on Monday that his fighters were not responsible. He defended his militia, saying it was necessary because the Malian military was failing to respond to violence in Dogon villages.\u201d\n\nThe Otero County Processing Center, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention facility in New Mexico.

The AP\u2019s Alan Fram reports: \u201c\u2018The president will be fine in the House,\u2019 said Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. \u2026 The House approved the resolution blocking Trump\u2019s emergency by 245-182 in February. On Tuesday, Trump opponents will need to reach 288 votes to prevail. Just 13 Republicans opposed Trump in February, around 1 in 15. Another 30 would have to defect to override his veto.\u201d\n\n-- The Pentagon formally notified Congress that it has authorized the transfer of $1 billion for the construction of 57 miles of wall along the border. CNN's Barbara Starr and Jeremy Herb report: \u201cThe Department of Defense authorized the Army Corp of Engineers to begin planning and construction for the project Monday night. The department will direct the funds toward 18-foot-high fencing along the Yuma and El Paso sections of the border, according to a letter acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan sent to Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen.\u201d\n\n-- Gay and transgender detainees held at the Otero County Processing Center, a large Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in New Mexico, allege that they faced physical and verbal abuse while under the government\u2019s watch. Robert Moore reports: In a letter, attorneys for several immigrant rights groups allege that \u201c12 gay and transgender detainees at the Otero County Processing Center, a 1,000-bed facility about 30 miles north of this border city, routinely suffered sexual harassment and abuse from other detainees, that guards verbally assaulted them and that ICE officials violated their own regulations in denying hormone therapy to transgender detainees. They also allege that they were placed in solitary confinement after complaining about their treatment. \u2026 The man said he didn\u2019t file a complaint with officials because he feared retaliation. When a friend filed a complaint alleging that he was being sexually harassed and abused by fellow detainees, he and his friend were both placed in solitary confinement, he said.\u201d\n\n-- Nearly 108,500 undocumented immigrants have been released inside the U.S. by the federal government in the past three months, ICE acting director Ronald Vitiello said. The San Antonio Express-News\u2019s Guillermo Contreras reports: \u201cThe migrants are being released, with notices to appear later before immigration judges, because detention facilities are at capacity, Vitiello said. ICE later added that the crush on the feds\u2019 ability to transport immigrants to detention facilities, and an agreement on how long asylum-seekers can be held also contributed to the releases.\u201d\n\n-- A federal appeals court in California ruled that the parents of a woman fatally shot by a five-time deportee can\u2019t sue the city of San Francisco for failing to notify immigration officials that the man had been released from a local jail weeks before the killing. NPR\u2019s Richard Gonzalez reports: Kate Steinle was shot in 2015. Her parents filed a general negligence claim against the city, which was following \u201csanctuary city\u201d policies, but \u201ca three-judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, in a unanimous decision, ruled that San Francisco's then-sheriff, Ross Mirkarimi, violated no federal, state or local laws when he released Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez, also known as Jos\u00e9 Inez Garcia Zarate, on a minor marijuana charge without notifying Immigration and Custom Enforcement.\"\n\nSen. Tom Udall announced the end of a 20-year career on Capitol Hill. (Andrew Harnik/AP)\n\nTHE CHANGING OF THE GUARD:\n\n-- Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.) announced he won't run for a third term next year. John Wagner reports: \u201cUdall, a former congressman and state attorney general, was reelected to the Senate in 2014 with nearly 56 percent of the vote, and New Mexico had trended more heavily Democratic in recent years. \u2026 New Mexico\u2019s three House members, all Democrats \u2014 Deb Haaland, Xochitl Torres Small, Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n \u2014 are viewed as potential successors. Another potential candidate is Hector Balderas, the state\u2019s Democratic attorney general who is considered a rising star. The National Republican Senatorial Committee said with Udall\u2019s announcement, Republicans believe the state could be competitive in 2020.\u201d\n\n-- Rep. Jos\u00e9 Serrano, a Democrat who has represented the South Bronx since 1990, said he would not seek reelection because of his struggle with Parkinson\u2019s disease. Serrano represents the bluest district in the country. Hillary Clinton got 94 percent of the vote there in 2016. New York City Council member Ritchie Torres has already announced he will run for the seat in what will probably be a competitive primary. Serrano's son also might get in. Serrano has served as one of Congress\u2019s most ardent defenders of Puerto Rico, where he was born. (AP)\n\n-- Rep. Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.) won\u2019t run for the Senate in 2020, clearing the field for retired astronaut Mark Kelly to challenge incumbent Republican Sen. Martha McSally for the seat. The Arizona Republic\u2019s Yvonne Wingett Sanchez reports: \u201cGallego\u2019s decision will disappoint the left flank of the party. \u2026 By removing himself from running, Gallego also dashes GOP hopes of a competitive Democratic primary race that could have freed McSally to focus on her own campaign message while Gallego and Kelly battled it out for their party's nomination. In Gallego, Republicans saw an opportunity to wound Kelly by forcing him to answer for the more liberal positions that reflect the party's general direction.\u201d\n\n-- Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) drew a primary challenger from her right as she contemplates running for reelection in 2020. Derek Levasseur, a conservative blogger and former police officer, said that he was inspired to challenge Collins after she voted against Trump\u2019s emergency declaration at the southern border and that he would be a champion of the president\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d agenda. But Levasseur is still a long shot, given his relatively unknown status and a 2012 incident in which he was charged with assaulting four people, including his then-15-year-old daughter. (Bangor Daily News)\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is working on finding a balance between talking policy and opening up about his own life on the campaign trail.

Wootson Jr. reports: \u201c\u2018I don\u2019t like talking about myself,\u2019 Sanders (I-Vt.) confessed Saturday. \u2018I prefer to talk about ideas and vision.\u2019 Then, for more than six minutes, Sanders shared more personal details about himself than he\u2019d revealed during three weeks of policy-heavy speeches in Iowa and South Carolina. He spoke of growing up a son of poor immigrants in a rent-controlled Brooklyn apartment. \u2026 He spoke of reading books about the Holocaust with tears running down his face. Then, raising his voice, he expressed outrage at the latest example of animus centered on race and religion and ethnicity that left 50 Muslims dead in a mosque in Christchurch \u2026 The off-the-cuff, emotion-laden remarks earned Sanders a standing ovation.\"\n\n-- Elizabeth Warren released the findings of a new Government Accountability Office report this morning that suggests the need for stronger consumer privacy protections following the 2017 Equifax breach. Through the report \u2014 the second of its kind requested by Warren and Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) \u2014 the GAO recommended that the Federal Trade Commission be given stronger civil penalty authority to enforce laws to protect consumers. It also asks that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau improve its supervision of consumer credit reporting agencies. \"The GAO has issued very clear recommendations on how to protect consumers, so let's follow them. We need to give the FTC more tools to crack down on consumer data abuses and the CFPB needs to do its job, hold these firms accountable, and protect consumers,\u201d Warren and Cummings said in a news release.\n\n-- In an op-ed for The Post, Kamala Harris outlines a plan to give all teachers in America a raise: \u201cThe \u2018pay gap\u2019 between what teachers earn and what people with similar educations earn is creating disastrous consequences. Teachers are leaving their dream jobs because they can\u2019t make ends meet. \u2026 As president, I will make the largest federal investment in teacher pay in U.S. history. We will fully close the teacher pay gap during my first term, and provide the average teacher a $13,500 raise.\u201d Under the California Democrat's plan, the federal government would pay $3 for every $1 the state contributes to increasing teacher pay and make a multibillion-dollar investment in \u201cevidence-based programs that elevate the teaching profession.\u201d Half of this funding will be dedicated to historically black colleges and other minority-serving institutions. Harris said she would pay for the plan by increasing the estate tax for the richest 1 percent.\n\n-- No love for BDB in NYC: More than 250 New Yorkers gathered to cheer on a mayor who is considering a 2020 run. It wasn\u2019t their mayor, though. It was South Bend, Indiana\u2019s. The New York Times\u2019s Jeffery C. Mays reports: New York Mayor Bill de Blasio \u201chas appeared before small crowds in early primary states such as Iowa, South Carolina and New Hampshire, and came in last in a recent Quinnipiac University poll that asked which New York politician would make the best president. \u2026 Katie Held, 35, a tech product manager who has lived in Manhattan for four years, said [Pete] Buttigieg has \u2018East Coast values with a Midwestern knowledge.\u2019 Asked about a potential de Blasio campaign for president, Ms. Held said, \u2018No. Stay where you are.

What better way to start your day than with songs (picked by us and readers) about roads, rails, rivers and runways?\n\nAviation\n\nFAA IN THE SPOTLIGHT: The agency found few defenders at a Senate Commerce hearing Wednesday that focused on its certification of the Boeing 737 MAX and response to the two recent crashes involving the aircraft in Indonesia and Ethiopia. Our Brianna Gurciullo was there, and captured the scene as acting FAA Administrator Dan Elwell faced lawmakers eager for answers. Elwell confirmed his agency eventually delegated approval of a new anti-stall system on the MAX \u2014 linked to both crashes \u2014 to Boeing, after reviewing it within the FAA. He also repeated that he was the one who decided to ground the plane earlier this month, not Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao or President Donald Trump.\n\nBill coming: After the hearing, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) said it left him no more confident in the FAA\u2019s process for certifying airplanes. \u201cIf anything, my confidence in the FAA certification process is near zero right now because of the delegation, the outsourcing,\u201d he told reporters. Blumenthal said he would introduce legislation that \u201creforms the system of delegating safety responsibility and requires that critical features for safety be installed without any extra charge.\u201d Aviation Subcommittee Chairman Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said he hopes to have another hearing with industry representatives \u201csooner rather than later\u201d and wants Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg and pilot groups to be among the witnesses.\n\nCHAO\u2019S TAKE: The Transportation secretary, meanwhile, was peppered with questions about the ongoing investigations during a separate hearing on Trump\u2019s budget request for fiscal 2020. As our Tanya Snyder reported, she acknowledged that \u201ctroubling\u201d questions have been raised about FAA\u2019s dealings with Boeing, but she defended the agency\u2019s professionalism. One noteworthy line of questioning involved reports that Boeing charged airlines extra for safety features that could have helped pilots understand what was making the planes behave erratically. The company said in a statement Wednesday that it will no longer charge extra for the angle of attack indicator or disagree alert, but Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) also hinted she may pursue legislation on safety features being included in the basic sale price of planes.\n\nIn the House: Lawmakers are divided on how to approach the issue, including on whether further hearings would be useful or not and whether to focus attention on FAA\u2019s certification or on questions about pilot training standards and cockpit automation. More here from your host and Tanya.\n\nHappening at DOT: The inspector general officially launched its audit of the 737 MAX certification on Wednesday, Brianna reported. The review will also look at FAA\u2019s response to the recent crashes involving the aircraft model.\n\nA lower-profile audit: The IG also announced Wednesday it will review the security controls for FAA\u2019s drone registration system (the excellently named DroneZone), which is also used to report minor drone accidents. \u201cBecause of the volume of sensitive data provided by the general public as well as the importance of UAS user data to FAA\u2019s oversight, we are initiating an audit to determine whether FAA\u2019s UAS registration system has the proper information security controls and recovery procedures in place,\u201d the IG wrote.\n\nA MUST-READ: One could be forgiven for missing this given, well, a bit of other aviation news this week, but ProPublica published a timely story about Elwell\u2019s interactions with airline lobbyists and executives while on a deregulatory task force at DOT in the early days of the Trump administration. Click for the inside look at what one expert calls \u201cclubby\u201d email conversations between regulators and regulated, and keep reading for a breakdown of the larger questions about coziness between FAA and the industry.\n\nPOMPEO DECRIES AIRLINE SUBSIDIES: A group of American carriers has lobbied hard enough for Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to issue a stern warning to governments that subsidize their airlines. \u201cMake no mistake about it. American jobs are impacted when other countries subsidize the airlines. It's not fair. It's not right,\" Pompeo said on a news show this week. The ire of American Airlines, Delta and United (and Pompeo) is directed toward another trio of airlines \u2014 Etihad, Emirates and Qatar Airways \u2014 for having allegedly having received millions in subsidies from their governments. They specifically complain about Air Italy, an EU airline in which Qatar holds a 49 percent stake, and charge that its flights to the U.S. violate the terms of the agreement Qatar signed with the U.S.\n\nWhat\u2019s next: Since the EU seems happy with Air Italy abiding by its ownership and controls laws, the U.S. might have some trouble convincing Brussels there's a problem.\n\nIN CONGRESS\n\nFAA SHUTDOWN PROTECTION BILL ADVANCES: The House Transportation Committee approved a bill Wednesday that would protect the FAA from future government shutdowns by allowing it to pull from the Airport and Airway Trust Fund in the case of appropriations lapses. The committee also advanced legislation that would pay the Coast Guard during shutdowns, require the Coast Guard to produce a report on its vulnerabilities to climate change, and create a task force on improvements to the FAA\u2019s Notices to Airmen.\n\nGrading the markup: It was the first markup on substantive policy issues in this Congress for the committee, which likes to call itself the most bipartisan (I know, I know, every committee says that). While the markup went relatively smoothly, one point of contention was on the Coast Guard climate bill. Rep. Scott Perry (R-Pa.) introduced an amendment that would not allow the report to reference the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, leading to a brief debate on the merits of the IPCC. The amendment was shot down (with a few Republicans voting with Democrats) and the bill ultimately approved.\n\nRail\n\nEXPLAIN YOURSELF: During the budget hearing, Chao also faced criticism from New England Democrats on the administration\u2019s budget proposal that would have cut in half funding for Amtrak\u2019s Northeast Corridor. \u201cHelp me square your recognition that this is the lifeblood of our region\u2019s economy with these very draconian cuts,\u201d Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) said. \u201cWe feel like we have been targeted by this administration and the president for specific cuts in infrastructure funding.\u201d Murphy also pushed back on DOT\u2019s decision to give the Gateway bridge and tunnel projects a medium-low rating that would make them ineligible for federal funds.\n\nTHE AUTOBAHN\n\n\u2014 \u201cA helicopter landed in a California poppy field during the super bloom, and officials are furious.\u201d Washington Post.\n\n\u2014 \u201cSafety advocate raises questions about Toyota, Subaru valve spring recalls.\u201d Automotive News.\n\n\u2014 \u201cTacoma\u2019s I-5 curve: Eight semitrailer crashes in six months prompt calls to \u2018slow down.\u2019\u201d Seattle Times.\n\n\u2014 \u201cSouthwest Airlines has canceled 9,400 flights in past six weeks, and more are on way.\u201d USA Today.\n\n\u2014 \u201cNissan committee says facts point to legal violations by former chairman Ghosn.\u201d Reuters.\n\nTHE COUNTDOWN\n\nDOT appropriations run out in 186 days.

Meanwhile, a federal judge ruled against the NCAA in a suit over paying athletes.\n\nIT\u2019S BUDGET DAY, MARCH 11. WELCOME TO MORNING EDUCATION.

And follow us on Twitter: @Morning_Edu and @POLITICOPro.\n\nDriving the Day\n\nWHITE HOUSE TO RELEASE BUDGET REQUEST: Look for proposed cuts to Education Department programs when the Trump administration releases its budget request today for fiscal 2020. The White House has prepared lawmakers to expect a 5 percent cut from the fiscal 2019 budget caps of nonmilitary arms of the federal government.\n\n\u2014 In its other two budget requests from previous years, the Trump administration sought to slash Education Department spending but Congress rejected such cuts. With Democrats in control of the House, it will be even harder for the administration to get what it wants.\n\nWHAT TO KNOW: What\u2019s coming out today is the first installment of the budget. Other details are expected in upcoming days. The fiscal year begins Oct. 1 and ends just one month before the 2020 presidential election.\n\nWHAT TO WATCH: The administration said last night that the proposal will include a \u201crisk sharing\u201d component that would put colleges on the hook for how well their students do paying back their student loans. (Read more on that from Benjamin Wermund.)\n\n\u2014 On the K-12 front, we will be watching closely to see if the administration proposes any private and public school choice friendly proposals \u2014 as it has largely unsuccessfully done in the last two years. Following Education Secretary Betsy DeVos\u2019 work in the last year to chair the federal school safety commission, it will be notable what the department proposes in terms of funds designed to make schools safer.\n\n\u2014 Also this week on Capitol Hill, there are at least four hearings focused on education. The first is Tuesday at 10 a.m. when the Senate HELP Committee takes up how best to simplify the Free Application for Federal Student Aid as part of the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act.\n\n\u2014 We\u2019re also keeping an eye on the Supreme Court, where the high court could say this week whether it will take up a case that challenges a school district\u2019s bathroom policy that allows transgender students to use bathrooms of their choice. The case, Doe v. Boyertown Area School District, has been on the Supreme Court\u2019s list to consider during its last two conferences, but was rescheduled each time. Friday is its next shot.\n\nPUSHING TO PAY STUDENT ATHLETES: Rep. Mark Walker (R-N.C.) plans to introduce legislation this week that would remove restrictions in the tax code on student-athletes using or being paid for the use of their name, image or likeness. He\u2019s still gathering co-sponsors, but Walker\u2019s office tells Morning Education it expects the bill to gain bipartisan backing.\n\n\u2014 \u201cSigning an athletic scholarship with a school should not be a moratorium on your rights to your name, image, and self-worth,\u201d Walker tweeted Thursday. \u201cWe have a plan to fix college sports without asking the #NCAA or our universities to pay a dollar: the Student-Athlete Equity Act.\u201d The Raleigh News & Observer has more.\n\n\u2014 Separately, a federal judge on Friday night ruled against the NCAA in a closely watched suit. She said collegiate athletes should be allowed to receive more compensation from schools but only if the benefits are tied to education, ESPN reports. Still, the ruling didn\u2019t go as far as the athletes involved in the suit wanted. Donald Remy, NCAA\u2019s chief legal officer, said in a statement that \u201calthough the court rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 desire for a free market system, we will explore our next steps as appropriate.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Also, the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics is out with a new database of athletics revenues, expenses and debt as well as institution-wide academic spending for more than 220 public NCAA Division I colleges and universities dating back to 2005. Check it out.\n\nSPOTLIGHT ON BUREAU OF INDIAN EDUCATION: On Tuesday in Phoenix, the Interior Department has scheduled a final rulemaking session to complete a new standards, assessments and accountability system for the Bureau of Indian Education, which operates some of the nation\u2019s lowest performing schools. The government shutdown forced the Interior Department to postpone the session earlier this year.\n\n\u2014 The Education Department has threatened to withhold funds from the agency unless it finishes the effort, which was required under the 2015 Every Student Succeeds Act. View the agenda.\n\n\u2014 The financial oversight of Bureau of Indian Education schools and the safety of school facilities could come up on Wednesday as the Senate Indian Affairs Committee holds a hearing looking at Indian programs on the GAO\u2019s high risk list. The hearing starts at 2:30 p.m. in Dirksen 628.\n\n\u2014 Also, the National Indian Education Association and the ACLU are praising the decision by the Skowhegan School Board in Maine to no longer use the mascot name \u201cIndians\u201d at Skowhegan High School. The ACLU in Maine tweets that Maine is the first state to end Indigenous mascots in schools.

The union says the terms of the settlement are confidential, but that the amount of compensation ranges from $38,000 to $105,000.\n\n\u2014 \u201cWhat happened a decade ago still stings, but the teachers in Washington, D.C., who were wrongly fired will take some measure of comfort from this settlement,\u201d says AFT President Randi Weingarten.

    "title": "The Daily 202: A judge\u2019s ruling against Medicaid work requirements shows the difficulty of scaling back entitlements",
    "description": "Trump ignored Pence and McCarthy\u2019s advice in picking another fight over Obamacare repeal.",
    "text": "House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) listens to President Trump speak in the Oval Office. He urged the president not to try killing Obamacare in the courts. (Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post)\n\nWith Joanie Greve and Mariana Alfaro\n\nTHE BIG IDEA: One of the reasons that so many conservatives who support smaller government fought so hard and for so long against Obamacare is that they understood there are no examples in American history of Congress clawing back a major entitlement program once its benefits go into effect.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act has passed a tipping point. This is why the legislative branch narrowly failed to repeal the law in 2017 despite Republican promises to do so \u2013 and majorities in both chambers.\n\nMore than any other policy issue, the GOP lost control of the House in the midterms because of a pending lawsuit by Republican attorneys general that puts millions of people with preexisting medical conditions at risk of losing protections they received as a result of the 2010 law.\n\nThe popularity of other provisions, like letting young adults stay on their parents\u2019 health plans until they turn 26, explains why GOP leaders on Capitol Hill are so anxious and angry that President Trump has picked a fresh \u2013 and they say futile \u2013 fight to replace the law.\n\nRolling back entitlements once they\u2019re expanded is politically perilous because there are always oodles of humanizing stories about individuals who would suffer, and people who stand to lose what they\u2019ve grown accustomed to care more about protecting their benefits than critics who don\u2019t want their tax dollars to pay for them.\n\nThis was true after Franklin Roosevelt created Social Security, Lyndon Johnson established Medicare and, now it seems, after Barack Obama expanded Medicaid. Republicans initially campaigned on overturning the New Deal and the Great Society. They relented only after public opinion hardened against doing so. This week we\u2019re seeing how that\u2019s starting to happen with Obamacare.\n\nIgnoring the advice of Vice President Pence and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, the president ordered the Justice Department this week to ask an appellate court to fully invalidate the Affordable Care Act as part of the lawsuit brought by Republicans in the states. Trump is now pressing GOP senators to come up with a replacement plan, something few have any appetite for.\n\n-- Two rulings issued last night by the federal district court in D.C. illustrate the human dynamics that make it so incredibly difficult to cut holes in the safety net. Judge James Boasberg threw sand in the gears of the Trump administration\u2019s campaign to compel poor people who depend on Medicaid to hold jobs in exchange for health benefits. For the second time, he rejected Kentucky\u2019s work requirement program and declared the rules that recently took effect in Arkansas \u201ccannot stand.\u201d\n\nBoasberg, an Obama appointee, said Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar behaved in an \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d manner when he signed off on the plans without considering the human impact and the intent of Congress when it established Medicaid. While his rulings technically apply only to the two states, they could also impact six other states that have received permission from the Trump administration to begin work requirements and seven other states that have applications pending.\n\nThe judge opened his 35-page Arkansas decision with an anecdote about one of the approximately 18,000 people who were denied coverage between September and December for failing to comply with the state\u2019s new requirements.\n\n\u201cAdrian McGonigal is 40 years old and lives with his brother in Pea Ridge, Arkansas,\u201d Boasberg wrote. \u201cHe used to have a job working in the shipping department of Southwest Poultry, a food-service company located nearby, although he received no medical insurance through his employer. Like many Americans, he has several serious medical conditions. Beginning in 2014, McGonigal was able to receive medical care \u2014 including regular doctor visits and numerous prescription drugs \u2014 through the state\u2019s expanded Medicaid program. In mid-2018, however, McGonigal learned that he would be subject to new work requirements. \u2026\n\n\u201cDespite his lack of access to, and difficulty working with, computers, he was able to report his employment in June 2018, but he did not know he needed to continue to do so each month. As a result, when he went to pick up his prescriptions in October, the pharmacist told him that he was no longer covered, and his medicines would cost him $800. In the absence of Medicaid, he could not afford the cost of the prescriptions and so did not pick them up. His health conditions then flared up, causing him to miss several days of work, and Southwest Poultry fired him for his absences. He thus lost his Medicaid coverage and his job.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Cloinger was tossed off of Medicaid, even though there's no doubt that her income is low enough that she qualifies for it. Her 3-year-old granddaughter, A'Riyiah Franklin, looks at a prescription she hasn't refilled since 2017 at their home in Marianna, Ark. (Michael S. Williamson/The Washington Post)\n\n-- My colleague Amy Goldstein, coincidentally, published a powerful piece yesterday morning from the small town of Marianna, Ark., about how hard it is for poor people in a job-starved region to comply with rules that may sound easy to you but turn out to be quite onerous: \u201cComputers are so scarce that even the public library has a sign out front saying it does \u2018not offer the Internet\u2019 \u2014 a problem for the work requirement\u2019s first several months, when people could not yet phone in their monthly reports.\u201d Amy\u2019s story includes these two particularly evocative examples:\n\n\u201cElizabeth Cloinger, 47, who lives in a trailer next to her cousin\u2019s house just outside town, thought she was complying with the new rules. She has been on Medicaid for years and already had a job, working seven days most weeks as a home health aide. Her wages \u2014 9.25 an hour, with 50 cents more for hospice patients \u2014 and her hours met the new rules. Yet she received a June letter saying she needed to verify that her income made her eligible, or she would be cut off.\n\n\u201cShe called the listed phone number and faxed information to a state employee in Pine Bluff. She was told that, like many people, she was exempt from the work requirements \u2014 in her case, because she was caring for her 20-year-old daughter recovering from a car accident and her 3-year-old granddaughter. But on Aug. 18, she received another letter, saying she had been terminated because she had not verified her income. In December, four letters arrived saying she needed to update her email address, then 11 more in January. Each letter told her to create an online account. She doesn\u2019t have a computer and didn\u2019t realize that the program requires everyone to get an email address.\n\n\u201cIn all these months, Cloinger hasn\u2019t seen a doctor for the swelling in her right foot, which makes it hard to stand for long. Nor has she addressed the throbbing around the scar from her hysterectomy two years ago. \u2018I won\u2019t go\u2019 to the doctor, she said, having just finally paid off \u2014 in $10 monthly installments \u2014 a hospital bill for the X-rays she needed for a torn tendon before she got onto Medicaid. \u2018I am just putting it in God\u2019s hands,\u2019 Cloinger said. \u2018He is going to let me stay on this Earth to see my grandbaby be raised.\u2019\u201d\n\nConisha Gatewood, 31, also got caught up in the confusion. She was referred to an obstetrician-gynecologist for nonstop menstrual bleeding caused by ovarian cysts: \u201cBut when she arrived for a September checkup, she was told she no longer had insurance. \u2018I was like: \u2018Yes, I do. They sent me the papers in June.\u2019\u2019\u2019 She thought she had done everything right, creating a password and an online account. The state had used an automated system to fill in her child-care job and work hours. A letter from the state confirmed that, she thought, telling her she did not need to search for a job because she already worked. But then another letter came, telling her she needed to do a job search after all. \u2018I was so confused,\u2019 Gatewood said. \u2018I already had a job. No one could tell me what I needed to do.\u2019\n\n\u201cBy the time she was cut off, she had found a better-paying position, selling cellphones inside a Walmart. In January, she reapplied to Arkansas Works \u2014 and was rejected because her December phone sales, high for the holidays, put her just over the income limit. She should go to her doctor this month, but she hasn\u2019t made an appointment. She has also stopped filling prescriptions, including for the birth control pills that correct her bleeding.\u201d\n\nActing White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney listens as Trump speaks. (Jacquelyn Martin/AP)\n\n-- Back to health care writ large: \u201cThe White House has no proposal in the works, according to administration officials, but Trump wants Republicans to pass a bill before his reelection effort that would do what Obamacare does \u2014 provide coverage to millions of Americans,\u201d Rachael Bade, Josh Dawsey, Seung Min Kim and John Wagner report. \u201cTrump spoke with Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.) on Tuesday evening and listed his priorities in a phone call with Sen. John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) on Wednesday morning. \u2026 White House aides said they are looking at a Barrasso plan that pushes short-term, limited-duration health insurance \u2026 Also in the mix is legislation from Sens.

Tracy Jan reports: \u201cThe charges caught Facebook off guard, coming one week after the social media giant agreed in a sweeping settlement with civil rights groups to overhaul its microtargeting ad system for job, housing and loan advertisements after discrimination complaints. \u2018We\u2019re surprised by HUD\u2019s decision, as we\u2019ve been working with them to address their concerns and have taken significant steps to prevent ads discrimination,\u2019 said Joe Osborne, a Facebook spokesman.

Ellen Nakashima reports: \u201cThis is the second consecutive year the Government Communications Headquarters, or GCHQ \u2014 the British spy agency equivalent to the U.S. National Security Agency \u2014 has identified serious problems.

Karoun Demirjian reports: \u201cRep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.), the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said that during a Wednesday phone call with Barr, the attorney general said it would be \u2018weeks, not months\u2019 before lawmakers can see the report, making it \u2018apparent that the department will not meet the April 2 deadline that we set\u2019 earlier this week. Barr would not promise that \u2018an unredacted full report with the underlying documents, evidence, would be provided to Congress and to the American people,\u2019 Nadler said. \u2018We\u2019re not happy about that, to put it mildly.\u2019 Though Nadler would not say whether lawmakers will issue a subpoena, he told reporters that April 2 was \u2018a hard deadline that we set and we mean it.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- Trump told Sean Hannity that he hasn't ruled out pardoning Michael Flynn and other campaign aides.

Most of that time was spent denigrating the investigation into whether the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to influence the 2016 election. Trump\u2019s victory lap ... included bashing the FBI as 'dirty cops,' former FBI director James B. Comey as 'a terrible guy,' and former CIA director John Brennan as a 'sick person.'

Spencer Hsu reports: \u201cChief U.S. District Judge Beryl A. Howell of Washington on Wednesday held the first public hearing involving the secret subpoena fight by the foreign company since it rebuffed a grand jury request last July for documents. Howell asked David Goodhand, senior counsel to U.S. Attorney Jessie K. Liu of the District, whether the grand jury impaneled by Mueller remained active. Subpoenas and contempt proceedings related to a grand jury expire when a grand jury ends. \u2018It\u2019s continuing robustly,\u2019 Goodhand said.\u201d\n\nThe hearing was held to consider a request by the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press to unseal materials related to the case, including the identity of the mystery company: \u201cHowell said she would issue an order granting a \u2018huge chunk\u2019 of the Reporters Committee\u2019s request to make records public after she gave each side at least one month to confer about potential redactions to the sealed court motions and hearing transcripts in the case.\u201d\n\n-- House Democrats are seeking access to 10 years of Trump\u2019s financial records after Michael Cohen claimed the president had inflated his net worth.

(Brittany Greeson/The Washington Post)\n\nTHE POLITICAL FALLOUT:\n\n-- Trump will visit Grand Rapids, Mich., tonight for his first campaign rally since Mueller submitted a report that has only inflamed passions on both sides of the political divide. Greg Jaffe and Jenna Johnson report: \u201cKaren Dunnam, 62, will be taking part in a protest that she helped organize. She will be demonstrating against Trump but also the \u2018Magahats,\u2019 which she pronounces \u2018maggots,\u2019 who have come to support him. \u2026 Inside the arena, which is likely to be packed with more than 12,000 people, Liz Johnson, a law student and mother of three boys, will be volunteering on behalf of her president. She wonders about the damage done by the long investigation and why it couldn\u2019t have been completed sooner. \u2026 Many Republicans, like Johnson, said that the report proved definitively that Trump was the victim of a baseless two-year vendetta brought on by a deep-state Washington establishment that he had vowed to dethrone. Many Democrats, like Dunnam, said the real truth about Trump was buried somewhere in the unreleased details of Mueller\u2019s report.\u201d\n\n-- A majority of Americans say Barr\u2019s letter did not exonerate Trump of collusion, according to a new CNN-SSRS poll. CNN\u2019s Jennifer Agiesta reports: \u201cA majority (56%) says the President and his campaign have not been exonerated of collusion, but that what they've heard or read about the report shows collusion could not be proven. Fewer, 43%, say Trump and his team have been exonerated of collusion. \u2026 Republicans and Democrats are on opposite sides of this question: 77% of Republicans say the President has been exonerated, 80% of Democrats say he has not.

William Booth and Karla Adam report: \u201cIn a special late-night session of \u2018indicative votes,\u2019 an effort to find new ways to break the impasse, the House of Commons could not produce a majority for any of eight Brexit proposals put forth by members. \u2026 May offered no timetable for her possible departure. Some Tory lawmakers said a leadership election within the party could happen over the summer, with May leaving 10 Downing Street by the autumn. \u2026 While May\u2019s offer to step aside encouraged a number of Conservative rebels to say they now will support her twice-defeated Brext deal, she still may not have enough votes for the deal to pass this divided Parliament. Crashing out of the European Union without a deal as well as a long delay, a general election or a second referendum all remain options as the chaos of Brexit continues.\u201d\n\n-- The British environment secretary Michael Gove and former foreign secretary Boris Johnson are considered two front-runners to replace May. Karla Adam reports: \u201cGove, a prominent Brexiteer and one of the Conservative Party\u2019s more cerebral figures, played a key role in the 2016 Vote Leave campaign. He has been loyal to May since returning to the cabinet, but his reputation took a hit after he was accused of betraying Johnson in the 2016 leadership contest. \u2026 Johnson is that rare politician who has cross-party appeal. He served two terms as the mayor of London \u2014 an impressive feat in a city that typically votes Labour. But his popularity began to slump after the 2016 European Union referendum, especially in pro-E.U. cities such as London, and he received mixed reviews for his time as foreign secretary.\u201d\n\n-- While testifying on Capitol Hill, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo deflected questions about whether Kim Jong Un bears responsibility for North Korea\u2019s human rights abuses. When asked whether Kim was responsible for his country\u2019s labor camps, Pompeo repeatedly said, \u201cHe\u2019s the leader of the country.\u201d In response to a question about Otto Warmbier, Pompeo chose to blame \u201cthe North Korean regime\u201d for the American student\u2019s death rather than Kim himself.

Peter Elms, the assistant general manager of Immigration New Zealand, said in a statement that there were 6,457 registrations after the shooting, and 4,844 in the 10 days before.

While Trump has thrown his support behind Guaid\u00f3, Russia and China remain loyal to Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. From Al Jazeera: \u201cThe US government says the Russian troops include special forces and cybersecurity personnel. \u2018They've got a lot of pressure right now. They have no money, they have no oil, they have no nothing. They've got plenty of pressure right now.

Laura Meckler reports: \u201cTrump\u2019s proposed 2020 budget marked the third year that Education Secretary Betsy DeVos has proposed the cut. But as word spread following Tuesday\u2019s hearing, attacks poured in from Capitol Hill, the presidential campaign trail and Twitter. DeVos defended the proposal, saying Special Olympics benefits from private philanthropic support. \u2026 That did little to calm the storm. \u2026 The proposal appeared dead again this year. Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri, the top Republican on the Senate panel that oversees appropriations for the Education Department, said in a statement that his chamber\u2019s bill will not cut the funding.\u201d The cost of five of the president\u2019s trips to Mar-a-Lago would cover DeVos\u2019s proposed cuts to the Special Olympics, Philip Bump notes.\n\n-- The commissioner of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection warned that the country has hit a \u201cbreaking point\u201d at the border amid a surge of immigrants. Nick Miroff and Maria Sacchetti report: \u201cKevin McAleenan \u2026 said that for the first time in more than a decade, his agency is \u2018reluctantly\u2019 performing direct releases of migrants, meaning they are not turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, they are not detained, they are not given ankle bracelets to track their movements and they are allowed to leave with just a notice to appear in court at a later date. He said that this is a \u2018negative outcome\u2019 but that it is \u2018the only current option we have\u2019 because of overcrowding at detention facilities as Central Americans stream to the border knowing they will be able to gain entry with asylum claims.\u201d\n\n-- Not much is behind many of the executive orders that the president signs with much fanfare. The Los Angeles Times\u2019s Noah Bierman reports: \u201cFor a president who relishes pomp and shows of executive action, unchecked by Congress, signing ceremonies have become a hallmark, a way to convey accomplishment for a man who asserts he has done more than any president in history. The Times reviewed 101 executive orders Trump has signed since inauguration day, and interviewed experts, advocates and administration officials about their effects. Many were geared toward favored political constituencies, including veterans, blue-collar workers and evangelical Christians. Few moved policy significantly; generally the orders created committees or task forces, demanded reports or pressed for enforcement of existing laws.\u201d\n\n-- Stephen Moore, Trump\u2019s nominee for a seat on the Federal Reserve, owes more than $75,000 in taxes and other penalties. Bloomberg News\u2019s Christopher Condon and Joe Light report: \u201cA federal tax lien filed in the circuit court for Montgomery County, Maryland, where Moore owns a house, says that the government won a judgment against Moore for $75,328.80. The January 2018 filing said it was for unpaid taxes from the 2014 tax year and could accrue additional penalties and other costs. \u2026 Moore referred questions about the tax debt to his wife, Anne Carey.\u201d\n\n2020 WATCH:\n\n-- During his CNN town hall last night, Sen. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) promised to go to war against the NRA if elected president as he explained that gun violence is very personal to him. CNN\u2019s Gregory Krieg and Dan Merica report: \u201cI am tired of going to funerals where parents are burying their children,\u201d Booker said before referencing the death of Shahad Smith, a 28-year-old man killed in Newark. \u201cI live in Newark, and my mayor is doing a great job in lowering crime, but there are shootings \u2026 Shahad Smith was killed with an assault rifle on my block last year, on the top of the block where I live.\u201d\n\nBooker also expressed frustration at the way his Democratic rivals are debating reparations, saying the issue has been reduced to \u201ca box to check on a presidential list\u201d: \u201cThis is so much more of a serious conversation,\u201d he said. \u201cSo do I support legislation that is race-conscious about balancing the economic scales? Not only do I support it, but I have legislation that actually does it.\u201d The senator then slammed \u201chorrible crime bills\u201d signed in the 1990s by some of his fellow 2020 candidates. The most notable was the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act in 1994 that former vice president Joe Biden wrote when he was a senator and that gained support from Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee when they were representatives.\n\n-- While Booker was mayor of Newark, the city\u2019s police force attracted numerous complaints of racial profiling. The New York Times\u2019s Nick Corasaniti and Stephanie Saul scrutinizes his record: Booker \u201chad swept into office in 2006 pledging a safer city through zero tolerance on crime. And while killings actually rose in his first year, over the next three they fell to historic lows. Yet grievances against the police were piling up in the city\u2019s black wards, with allegations of racial profiling, unlawful stops and excessive force. The A.C.L.U. and local activists pressed for reforms, complaining about pushback from Mr. Booker, whose administration was promoting the plunging homicide rate.\u201d\n\n-- As California\u2019s attorney general, Kamala Harris championed a war against truancy. Now some of the parents who were caught up in it are speaking out against the Democratic senator. Cheree Peoples was arrested six years ago after her daughter, Shayla, repeatedly missed school because of complications caused by sickle cell anemia. Despite plenty of evidence given to Shayla\u2019s school about her illness, Peoples was still detained. \u201cPeoples was caught up in the hugely complex forces Harris and her tough-on-truancy stance unleashed more than a decade ago,\u201d HuffPost\u2019s Molly Redden reports. \u201cHarris has since replaced her punitive stance with the message that parents of truant children need help, not scare tactics \u2026 Peoples\u2019 arrest wasn\u2019t a freak occurrence -- it was the inevitable outcome of Harris\u2019 campaign to fuse the problem of truancy with the apparatus of law enforcement. ... There are still hundreds of families across California entering the criminal justice system under the aegis of Harris\u2019 law.\u201d\n\n-- Former Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe (D) is inching closer to a 2020 presidential run. He has reportedly been telling allies that he will probably jump into the race next month. (CNN)\n\n-- Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) released her 2018 tax returns and encouraged fellow presidential candidates to do the same. The New York Times\u2019s Alexander Burns reports: \u201cMs. Gillibrand stated that she earned $167,634 from her salary and an additional $50,000 through a book that she reported as business income. She paid $29,170 in federal taxes. Ms. Gillibrand, who is currently at the bottom of the polls, recorded a video touting the disclosure of her taxes as a step toward political transparency.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cMany of the Democrats vying to challenge Trump in 2020 haven\u2019t been quick to disclose their own personal tax returns, saying it will take some time for the documents to be assembled or offering vague explanations for the delay,\u201d Holly Bailey notes. Other than Gillibrand, only Sen. Elizabeth Warren has offered an extensive look at her tax records \u2014 posting filings on her campaign site dating back to 2008, when the then-Harvard Law professor was appointed to a congressional panel overseeing the government\u2019s response to the 2008 financial crisis. Warren, who prepares her own taxes, has yet to file her 2018 return but plans to make it public when she does, according to her campaign.\u201d\n\n-- Warren unveiled a plan to take on farm consolidation by demanding changes from the largest corporate agricultural firms, a proposal that could attract a lot of interest in Iowa. The Des Moines Register\u2019s Brianne Pfannenstiel and Kim Norvell report: Warren\u2019s plan \u201cwould address consolidation in the agribusiness industry, \u2018un-rig\u2019 the rules she says favor its largest players, and elevate the interests of family farmers. \u2026 The companies she names in her plan \u2014 Tyson, Dow-DuPont and Bayer-Monsanto \u2014 are some of the key players in Iowa's economy. \u2026 Rural Iowa, in particular, has felt the effects of farm consolidation, which creates ripple effects through local economies. According to data for the U.S. Agriculture Census, Iowa lost 32,600 farms during a 30-year period that ended in 2012.\u201d\n\n-- Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) proposed a trillion-dollar plan to rebuild infrastructure across the nation. In a Medium post, Klobuchar\u2019s campaign presented the proposal as the senator\u2019s \u201ctop budget priority\u201d if she were elected president. It will target, among other issues, the repair of roads, highways and bridges and the construction of protection against flooding, as well as the modernization of airports and seaports and the expansion of public transit options.\n\n-- \u201cDemocrats\u2019 2020 policy proposals almost certainly require middle class tax hikes,\" Jeff Stein notes.\n\n-- Former gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams predicted a female or minority candidate would win the Democratic nomination. Abrams added later in an appearance on \u201cThe View\u201d that she is \u201copen to all options,\u201d including a presidential bid. She also said that although she has spoken to Biden, serving as his running mate \u201cwas not the core issue.\u201d On the possibility that she would enter the 2020 field to get a vice-presidential nod, she said, \u201cI think you don\u2019t run for second place.\u201d (John Wagner)\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) leads an event to introduce the Climate Action Now Act. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP)\n\nTHE NEW CONGRESS:\n\n-- In response to the Green New Deal, Nancy Pelosi unveiled a limited bill to combat climate change that would keep the United States in the Paris accord. Mike DeBonis reports: \u201cA day earlier, as some Democrats have embraced Medicare-for-all, Pelosi (D-Calif.) rolled out legislation to shore up the Affordable Care Act \u2026 In both cases, the bills are much more in line with the centrist platforms of freshman lawmakers who unseated Republicans in dozens of suburban and rural districts that will be crucial to the party holding its majority in 2020. Pelosi has been careful not to openly disparage the left-wing proposals on health care and climate change, lest she open a fissure inside her caucus. At a closed-door meeting Tuesday, for instance, she said she was not ruling out broader legislation.\u201d\n\n-- Senate Democrats revealed their own ethics and elections overhaul bill, but it has no chance of receiving a vote. Mike DeBonis reports: \u201cDubbed, like the House bill, the For the People Act, the Senate legislation includes a vast suite of proposals \u2014 including measures meant to expand voting, provisions aimed at unmasking and diluting the power of moneyed interests, new ethical strictures for federal officials and a new public financing system for congressional campaigns.\u201d Mitch McConnell has called the proposals a \u201cpower grab\u201d and vowed to never bring them up for a vote.\n\n-- Republican senators warned the president that his trade war could fuel a recession ahead of the 2020 election. Politico\u2019s Burgess Everett and Adam Behsudi report: \u201cBehind closed doors, GOP senators push back on Trump consistently when he brings up existing tariffs on steel and aluminum or potential tariffs on automakers, according to Republican senators. But Trump doesn\u2019t back down from his position: He says the threat of tariffs gets the attention of trading partners \u2014 like China \u2014 who need to permit more imports of American products.\u201d\n\n-- Rep. Richie Neal (D-Mass.), the House Ways and Means Committee chairman, spoke to Trump about a $1.5 trillion infrastructure package. But Trump, Neal said, rejected the proposal, saying, \u201cWe can go bigger than that\u201d: \u201cBut when asked what Trump or White House officials have done since then, Neal laughingly said, 'That I don't know.'\" (Politico)\n\n-- If he decides to run for the seat of retiring Sen. Tom Udall (D-N.M.), Rep. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n (D-N.M.), who is Hispanic, could potentially join a chamber that has a dearth of Hispanic members. Paul Kane reports: \u201cThe Latino Victory Fund jumped on Udall\u2019s announcement Monday that he planned to retire at the end of 2020 by declaring that \u2018it\u2019s crucial that the next U.S. senator from New Mexico be Hispanic.\u2019 By Wednesday afternoon the PAC devoted to increasing Hispanic elected officials launched a website trying to draft Luj\u00e1n into the Senate race \u2026 Hispanic leaders have often felt that, when it comes to statewide office, particularly Senate races, that establishment Democrats often favored the \u2018electability\u2019 of a white candidate over a rising star Latino.\u201d\n\n-- Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) is hosting frequent town halls to avoid losing his seat next year, but both Republicans and Democrats smell blood in the water after the congressman was stripped of his committee assignments earlier this year. The New York Times\u2019s Catie Edmondson reports: \u201cHoping to win over prominent conservatives tired of putting out Mr. King\u2019s fires, three Republicans \u2014 widely considered the most serious challengers Mr. King has faced in years \u2014 have already pledged to run in the 2020 primary race, including an assistant majority leader of the Iowa State Senate, Randy Feenstra, who represents one of the most conservative swaths of the district. The campaign arm of the House Democrats has also put a target on his back, and the state Democratic Party has deployed an organizer to set up a ground game for next year, the earliest Democrats have ever begun such efforts in a district that backed [Trump] by nearly 30 percentage points.\u201d\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA SPEED READ:\n\nThe president started the day tweeting about his distaste for \u201cfake news\u201d and said he might tell the world one day how he \u201clearned to live\u201d with it:\n\nThe Fake News Media is going Crazy! They are suffering a major \u201cbreakdown,\u201d have ZERO credibility or respect, & must be thinking about going legit. I have learned to live with Fake News, which has never been more corrupt than it is right now. Someday, I will tell you the secret! \u2014 Donald J.

Let\u2019s declassify all evidence you say exists, and ALSO declassify the underlying documents that \u201cjustified\u201d the investigation.\n\n\n\n(Spoiler: There is no collusion evidence) \u2014 Mark Meadows (@RepMarkMeadows) March 27, 2019\n\nOne of those Democratic congressmen replied:\n\nNext time @ me. You also have my cell phone number & see me every day at work. If you\u2019re serious, you know how to find me. And you can show you\u2019re serious by asking @realDonaldTrump to release the #MuellerReport. https://t.co/EZwx1Etv5q \u2014 Rep. Eric Swalwell (@RepSwalwell) March 27, 2019\n\nHe added:\n\nFirst they came for the journalists.\n\n\n\nThen they came for the elected officials expressing legitimate concerns about justice in our country and attacks upon our democracy.\n\n\n\nWho's next?https://t.co/SBSkXb7kJa \u2014 Eric Swalwell (@ericswalwell) March 26, 2019\n\nA Post reporter shared this scene from the border in El Paso:\n\nMaria Shriver slammed the Trump administration's efforts to defund the Special Olympics, which was founded by Shriver's mother, Eunice:\n\nCouldn\u2019t have said it better @GavinNewsom: Statement of values.\n\nThis after Karen Pence went to Abu Dhabi to show administration support.\n\nInsane. https://t.co/iZKXzOFd4U \u2014 Maria Shriver (@mariashriver) March 27, 2019\n\nA former Republican governor demanded that the administration reconsider the decision:\n\nThe @SpecialOlympics gives people a sense of purpose, respect and confidence.

I asked one of the lobbyists: \"What are you selling today?\" He replied: \"Anything they will buy.\" With a smile. \u2014 Eric Lipton (@EricLiptonNYT) March 27, 2019\n\nA Reuters White House reporter lodged this noise complaint:\n\nIf you're going to play the bagpipes out in front of the White House, you should be reasonably good at it. \u2014 Steve Holland (@steveholland1) March 27, 2019\n\nAnd a writer for a D.C. sports talk radio show mocked Bryce Harper's new ads for the Phillies:\n\nBryce Harper ads sure lack a certain charm when presented as still images: How I LONGED to see the liberty bell?\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s a hundred miles away, bro.

Can a PR expert pull these kids out?\u201d by Roxanne Roberts: \u201cSay you\u2019re a rich parent caught in the college bribery scandal. You need a lawyer, of course. And your kid just might need their own public-relations expert. That\u2019s where Juda Engelmayer, a crisis communications manager, comes in. He\u2019s already been retained by two wealthy families accused of bribing college officials to help their children, including an Ivy League senior with great grades whom no one wants to hire. \u2018He\u2019s been rejected at job after job,\u2019 Engelmayer says. \u2026 Wait, what\u2019s that squeaky sound you hear? The world\u2019s smallest violin playing for these privileged children, who probably deprived qualified applicants a spot at these universities.\u201d\n\n-- LA Times, \u201cFor Michael Avenatti, a luxury lifestyle built on a purported house of cards,\u201d by Michael Finnegan and Mark Z. Barabak: \u201cLong before he was Stormy Daniels\u2019 lawyer, well before he was accused of trying to shake down Nike for millions of dollars, Michael Avenatti was an Orange County plaintiff\u2019s attorney living a luxe life adorned with fast cars, high-end properties and expensive jewelry. He flew in a private jet, lived in a mansion overlooking the Pacific and rang up six-figure receipts at Neiman Marcus and other sumptuous retailers. That his wealth might in fact be illusory, built on a flimsy and teetering financial foundation, slowly grew clear to some who knew Avenatti and hounded him for years in Bankruptcy Court and other venues in search of money he owed.\u201d\n\n-- Scientific American, \u201cWhy Losing Our Newspapers Is Breaking Our Politics,\u201d by Matthew P. Hitt, Joshua Darr and Johanna Dunaway: \u201cThere are no doubt many reasons for the rise of partisanship, but our research, using voting data from across the country over a four year period, recently uncovered an important one: the loss of local newspapers. As local newspapers disappear, citizens increasingly rely on national sources of political information, which emphasizes competition and conflict between the parties. Local newspapers, by contrast, serve as a central source of shared information, setting a common agenda. Readers of local newspapers feel more attached to their communities. Unless something is done, our politics will likely become ever more contentious and partisan as the media landscape consolidates and nationalizes.\u201d\n\nHOT ON THE LEFT: \u201cGOP legislator prays to Jesus for forgiveness before state\u2019s first Muslim woman swears in,\u201d from Reis Thebault: \u201cState Rep. Stephanie Borowicz was on the ninth \u2018Jesus\u2019 of her opening prayer in the Pennsylvania statehouse when other lawmakers started to look uncomfortable. Speaker Mike Turzai, a fellow Republican, glanced up \u2014 but Borowicz carried on, delivering a 100-second ceremonial invocation that some of her colleagues decried as an offensive, divisive and Islamophobic display shortly before the legislature swore in its first Muslim woman. \u2026 By the time she said \u2018Amen,\u2019 Borowicz had invoked Jesus 13 times, deploying the name between prayerful clauses as though it were a comma. \u2026 \u2018It blatantly represented the Islamophobia that exists among some leaders \u2014 leaders that are supposed to represent the people,\u2019 [said] Rep. Movita Johnson-Harrell, the newly sworn-in Democrat who is Muslim.\u201d HOT ON THE RIGHT: \u201cMSNBC\u2019s Trump-Russia Ratings Fizzle: \u2018Time to Pivot to 2020,\u2019\u201d from the Daily Beast: \u201cWithin MSNBC, there\u2019s an acknowledgement that the Trump-Russia narrative on which the cable network\u2014and especially its primetime star [Rachel] Maddow\u2014built monster ratings has fizzled for the moment. \u2026 And it\u2019s also possible that the Mueller disappointment drove loyal viewers away in much the same way that people avoid looking at their 401(k)s when the stock market is down. Maddow, who has consistently vied for the first or second top-rated cable news program, was sixth on Monday evening, down almost 500,000 total viewers from the previous Monday \u2026 The hope now is that Trump\u2019s conduct as president, along with the ramping up of the 2020 presidential campaign, will prove powerful storylines that will give MSNBC the opportunity to regroup.\u201d\n\nDAYBOOK:\n\nTrump will meet with the secretary of state before traveling to Grand Rapids, Mich., for a rally. He will end the day at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY: South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg was asked about speculation that James Buchanan , the 15th president, was gay: \u201cMy gaydar is not great to begin with, and it definitely doesn\u2019t work over long stretches of time, so I think we\u2019ll have to let the historians figure that one out.\u201d (The Hill)\n\nNEWS YOU CAN USE IF YOU LIVE IN D.C.:\n\n-- Plenty of sun today as we swing into spring. The Capital Weather Gang forecasts: \u201cBe sure to mark these next few days down as an honest-to-goodness visit by spring! Showers crash the party Sunday and notably cooler air settles in to start the first week of April. At least we seem to be safe from any immediate jump into summer.\u201d\n\n-- Today\u2019s conditions make perfect opening day weather as the Nationals gear up for the first game of the season. (David Streit)\n\n-- The Wizards beat the Suns 124-121. (Candace Buckner)\n\n-- A 17-year-old pleaded guilty to threatening gun violence at a Charlottesville school, which forced schools in the city to close last week. Peter Hermann reports: \u201cJoseph D. Platania, the Charlottesville commonwealth\u2019s attorney, said in the statement that investigators concluded the youth\u2019s 'sole motivation and intent was to seek attention and cause disruption within our community.' That is why, he said, authorities decided juvenile court was appropriate.\u201d\n\n-- Maryland\u2019s aid-in-dying bill failed to advance in the state Senate. The majority-Democratic chamber deadlocked in a 23-to-23 vote on the measure, which would have given a dying patient the option of asking a doctor for a lethal injection of drugs. Supporters of the proposal complained that changes from the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee created so many roadblocks in the legislation that few people would take advantage of it even if it became law. (Ovetta Wiggins)\n\n-- Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) vetoed a $15 minimum wage bill that may now go into an override fight in the Democratic-controlled General Assembly. Erin Cox and Ovetta Wiggins report: \u201cHogan (R) also vetoed bills allowing school districts to set their own calendars and stripping power to regulate alcohol and tobacco from the state comptroller. All three bills passed by veto-proof majorities, and lawmakers could attempt to overturn the vetoes as soon as Thursday. ... The governor has repeatedly said that a $15 wage could ultimately end up hurting the low-earning workers that the bill is designed to help. Hogan criticized Democrats for not acting on his alternative proposal for a smaller wage increase, which he said would allow Maryland to remain competitive with surrounding states.\u201d\n\n-- The Maryland House of Delegates reprimanded Del. Jay Jalisi (D) after allegations that he emotionally abused his staff. Joint Ethics Committee Chairman Sandy Rosenberg (D) said that an investigation into Jalisi\u2019s behavior revealed he had engaged in \u201ca pattern of verbal abuse, controlling and belligerent behavior.\u201d In one particularly memorable incident from the ethics report on his conduct, Jalisi allegedly called someone \u201cstupid\u201d and made the person \u201cstand in the delegate\u2019s office and repeat, \u2018I am incompetent.
