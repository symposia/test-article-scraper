    "title": "Russia is going to test an internet \u2018kill switch\u2019 and its citizens will suffer",
    "description": "Russia is planning to disconnect itself from the global internet in a test sometime between now and April. The country says it is implementing an internal internet (intranet) and an internet \"kill switch\" to protect itself against cyberwar. The question is, w\u2026",
    "text": "An internet \"kill switch\" has been in Russia's legislative plans for some time -- though it's not entirely about defense. Russia sees this drastic move as a means to solve the dual issues of defending itself from cyberwar attacks and more tightly controlling its citizens' access to information.\n\nAs news of the impending shutdown test came originally from Russian-language newswire RBK (and was sloppily reported), it was easy to get the impression that this was a complete, countrywide internet shutdown.\n\nRather, the country would use Runet, a sovereign, government-run internal web that would keep citizens connected, but only within the country. Runet would run during internet blackouts in the event of \"targeted large-scale external influence.\" Access to the outside would be cut off, and vice versa, but they would still have email and other things (controlled by the government, obviously).\n\nA national intranet is an IP-based walled garden used as a substitute for the real (global) Internet. Typically, its purpose is to control and monitor the communications of citizens while also restricting their access to outside media. Like in Iran.\n\nAfter years of rumors, Iran rolled out its state-run intranet in January 2018. As the global intelligence company Stratfor explained, \"To access [Iran's intranet], users and website owners must sign up with the government, an arrangement that empowers Iranian officials to coerce internet service providers to comply with their demands.\" This way, \"Iran's government can cut access to the global internet for prolonged periods, as it did during the [pro-democracy] Green Movement protests, without taking the entire country offline.\"\n\nAnother country that controls its population via intranet is North Korea. Its Kwangmyong network is the oldest one we know of, believed to have been instituted in 2000.\n\nInternet blackouts seldom go well for citizens. You may also remember when Egypt disappeared from the internet in 2011. This was during the Mubarak regime protests (including the events of Tahir Square), when citizens staged demonstrations calling out corruption, police brutality, free speech attacks, and various human rights violations. In response, Egypt's government cut off the entire country's access to the internet -- 85 million people.\n\nSyria disconnected its population from the internet as well, in 2011. The first time was for its largest pro-democracy protest. Syria shut off the internet and opened fire, killing more than 72 people, while government forces assaulted towns seen as key to the demonstrations, killing even more.\n\nSo, generally, internet blackouts seem to be the favored tool of totalitarian governments that do bad things to people behind closed doors.\n\nPrior to 2012, a government-forced internet blackout could happen only under certain conditions. That was the year the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) rammed through global regulations that took control of the internet's traffic and took citizen access away from orgs like ICANN and handed it to governments. At the time, Dr. Alexander Kushtuev, ITU deputy director general, worked for Russia's largest national telecommunications operator, Rostelecom.\n\nNot surprisingly, early authors of the regulatory changes -- which the ITU attempted to keep secret -- were from a state bloc composed of Russia, China, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, Sudan, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n\nThat meetings and proposals around the agreement were withheld from public view showed that something was rotten; we only found out about it when researchers at George Mason University created the website WCITLeaks, which solicited and shared copies of leaked draft documents. In fact, one leaked doc showed that the organizers had pre-prepared a public relations strategy and hired consultants to avoid public outcry.\n\nDespite enormous opposition, the ITU set its legally binding agreement into place, making blackouts like the ones in Syria and Egypt a maneuver not impeded by treaties, agreements or any ICANN policies on human rights.\n\nAnyway, Russia got what it wanted. It got all the goodies packed into the 2012 ITU regulations, plus what was needed to set in motion the events we're seeing now. The country has a state-run intranet with a free pass to cut its citizens off from the global internet. And The Telegraph reminds us, \"The Russian government has been tightening its grip over the internet since social media facilitated huge protests against Mr Putin in 2011\u201313.\"\n\nThe purpose of the upcoming cutoff test is to work out the kinks before Russia implements a law introduced last year in its parliament mandating that Russian internet providers use Runet when the country disconnects its citizens from the rest of the world.\n\nInterestingly, the upcoming disconnect experiment is run by Russia's Information Security Working Group, whose member are telcos -- and is presided over by Natalya Kaspersky. Yes, that Kaspersky. She co-founded the namesake security company, and her ex-husband is ... Eugene Kaspersky. He still runs the security company they created together, which was banned by the US government in 2017 over its alleged ties to the Russian government.\n\nThe law (called \"Digital Economy National Program\") dictates that Russian telcos must install technical means to funnel all internet traffic \"to exchange points approved or managed by Roskomnazor, Russia's telecom watchdog,\" according to press. \"Roskomnazor will inspect the traffic to block prohibited content and make sure traffic between Russian users stays inside the country and is not re-routed uselessly through servers abroad, where it could be intercepted.\"\n\nThe point of all this is so Russia can enact an internet blackout. For security purposes, it claims.\n\nBut would an internet \"kill switch\" work in times of cyberwar?\n\nNot really. Oracle did a deep dive on this exact scenario and concluded that countrywide internet blackouts (with intranet reliance) actually make a country harder to defend. What makes the internet strong as a system, they explain, is its decentralization. Namely, diversity in infrastructure.\n\nIf a country has only five companies with licenses to carry and monitor traffic, then sure, it's a snap for authorities to make a phone call and send the country into a near-instant internet blackout. However, Oracle explains: \"This level of centralization also makes it much harder for the government to defend the nation's Internet infrastructure against a determined opponent ... They can do a lot of damage by hitting just a few targets.\"\n\nPacket Clearing House's Bill Woodcock reminds us that the United States entertained the same idea, of a disconnection protocol, in the 2008\u20132009 era. The idea was abandoned. Mr. Woodcock told Engadget that a kill switch is \"a pretty reasonable thing to test, and to prepare for, given how much the US is putting into cyber-offense, and how little regard the US has for nonproliferation efforts in this area.\" He added, \"Of course, the Russians do offense as well, but at least they have the sense to recognize that they're also living in a glass house.\"\n\nSoberingly, Woodcock tells us that Russia may be taking cues from its own cyber-attack victims:\n\nThe apt comparison to make here would be with the Russian attacks on Estonia in 2007 and Georgia in 2008. Estonia was prepared (in much the same way that Russia is getting to be now) while Georgia was not. The Russian attack on Estonia went nearly unnoticed, from a network user's perspective, while the one on Georgia was nearly totally effective, for a period of several months. The Georgian government had to migrate, entirely, to Google free business services.\n\nI think the thing many outlets are dancing around as they report on the blackout system implementation is Russia's intent to isolate its citizens and crack down on dissent. It's especially heartbreaking in light of new reports of a refreshed purge of LGBT men and women in Chechnya, where at least two are dead and dozens are being held. \"The new wave of persecution began in late December,\" wrote The Guardian, \"after an administrator for an online group for LGBT people on the social network VKontakte was detained. Police used the contacts in his phone to round up others.\"\n\nThe Guardian confirmed the reports with a Russian newspaper, which in turn confirmed in messages via VKontakte (Russia's state-run version of Facebook).\n\nWhen blackouts begin in Russia, these horrors will develop further and the world may be none the wiser.\n\nImages: Julie Dermansky/Corbis via Getty Images (Egypt, internet); Bill Hinton via Getty Images (Russia, computer)",

    "text": "The US government averted another shutdown when Donald Trump instead opted to declare a national emergency to fund his border wall dreams\u2014a wall which raises huge privacy and security concerns and will cause more problems than it solves. As the country digested the national emergency, cybersecurity workers were still scrambling to clean up the security nightmare wrought by the longest shutdown in history.\n\nAmid all the border wall news this week, you\u2019d be forgiven for missing that the president also signed an executive order creating the American AI Initiative. In an op-ed for WIRED, White House deputy assistant to the president for technology policy Michale Kratsios explained why AI strategy is a security issue. Speaking of AI, to combat the growing threat of deep fakes, a new tool uses the blockchain to monitor video for tampering and manipulation.\n\nA popular electric scooter can be hacked to speed up and stop. One in three Americans has been the victim of severe online harassment. A US Air Force defector allegedly helped Iranians hack America. If Russia really cuts itself off from the internet, as it has threatened, the unintended consequences would be far reaching.\n\nOh, and it was also Valentine\u2019s Day this week. We hope you didn\u2019t buy an internet-connected sex toy\u2014unless it was one of the few that meets basic privacy and security standards, or you\u2019re really into exhibitionism. Likewise, if you use OKCupid, Coffee Meets Bagel, or Jack'd, look out for some security lapses this months. And make sure you're staying safe on dating apps in general.\n\nThe Uyghur Muslim population in China\u2019s Xinjiang providence is under constant surveillance from the Chinese government. Uyghurs are forced to install spyware on their mobile devices, and accept Chinese officials invading their homes to live and observe their families. Hundreds of thousands have reportedly been sent to \u201cre-education camps.\u201d And those who are not interned are being tracked via facial recognition technology by cameras and GPS all over Xinjiang.\n\nLEARN MORE The WIRED Guide to Data Breaches\n\nThis week, a security researcher found that Chinese company SenseNets, which allegedly facilitates that facial recognition tracking, had left a database containing the associated data completely exposed online. The researcher was able to watch as \u201c6.7 million GPS coordinates were recorded,\u201d according to ZDNet, which broke the news. The database revealed how the government tracks Uyghurs throughout their day, noting the names of locations they frequent, as well as GPS coordinates, all matched to highly personal information like name, date of birth, sex, home address, official identification card number, and more.\n\nBefore realizing what he had stumbled across, the researcher alerted SenseNets that its server was exposed. The company then locked it down. \u201cHe now regrets helping the company secure its oppression tool,\u201d ZDNet reports.\n\nAccording to former employees, Facebook tracks users it worries pose a threat to the company via their mobile apps. CNBC reports that the program is known as BOLO, short for \u201cBe on the look out.\u201d BOLO is a list of Facebook account holders who have made threats against the company or its employees. Security guards at Facebook offices are informed to watch out for these individuals, and other security personnel are, according to what the former employees told CNBC, empowered to monitor their location using the GPS tracking on their Facebook apps. That latter fact is what security consultants said sets Facebook apart from other companies that maintain similar threat lists. One of the former employees called the program \u201cvery Big Brother-esque.\"\n\nA Texas man who had been banned from owning guns for a period of two years, owing to a history of domestic violence, was found by police with a partially printed 3-D AR-15 rifle and a list of politicians he allegedly planned to kill. The cops arrested him. It was a clear example, authorities said, of criminals attempting to circumvent the law and legal background checks by building weapons rather than buying them\u2014a potential popularized by gun-rights activist Cody Wilson, who WIRED has been following for years, and who was arrested on charges of child sexual assault last year.\n\nAfter the 2015 passage of the Iranian nuclear deal, under which Iran promised to destroy much of its nuclear program, president Barack Obama\u2019s White House and the rest of the world were hopeful that Iran\u2019s nuclear ambitions would be kept in check. Then last year president Trump backed the US out of the deal, and now The New York Times reports that his administration is \u201creviving\u201d a secretive program to sabotage Iran\u2019s weapons. Those efforts began under the presidency of George W Bush, and was continued by Obama until Iran\u2019s nuclear activity severely waned after the 2015 nuclear accord. With the accord abandoned, the US is apparently accelerating its sabotage. The Times reports that in the last two months, \u201ctwo Iranian attempts to launch satellites have failed within minutes.\u201d\n\nEver wonder, sitting in a college class as someone asks a less-than-brilliant question, how some of the students around you managed to get in? A current student at Stanford recently figured out that since 2015 any Stanford student who has requested to access their own admissions information under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) could, if they tweaked the URL on their own data, view that of other admitted students. This error would let students reach each other\u2019s admissions essays, see their test scores, ethnicity, and even whether they had applied for financial aid. The security flaw, as reported by Stanford\u2019s student newspaper The Stanford Daily, was found in the third-party system the school uses to host scanned admissions documents. The school has now closed the breach, and will be telling 93 students that their information was compromised.\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories",

    "title": "The Pentagon Needs to Woo AI Experts Away From Big Tech",
    "description": "Opinion: Without more DOD investment, there just aren\u2019t enough incentives to lure talent away from high-paying jobs with great benefits into a life of public service.",
    "text": "This week, President Donald Trump signed a new executive order on artificial intelligence and the Pentagon declassified part of its AI strategy. Neither was a first attempt at a national AI strategy. In 2016, the Obama administration published a comprehensive plan on the future of AI, which never had time to gain the momentum it needed in government. The Pentagon has been researching intelligent machines for the better part of 60 years, and only recently did it come to a consensus: Our future wars will be fought in code, using data and algorithms as powerful weapons. Using AI techniques, a military can \u201cwin\u201d by destabilizing an economy rather than demolishing countrysides and city centers. From that perspective, and given China\u2019s unified march advancing artificial intelligence, China is dangerously far ahead of the West.\n\nWIRED OPINION ABOUT Amy Webb (@amywebb) is a professor at the NYU Stern School of Business and is the chief executive of the Future Today Institute, a strategic foresight and research group in Washington, DC.\n\nIn my view, we\u2019ve come to this realization too late. Regardless of what orders might be signed or what new strategies are put into action, Washington is going to have a recruitment problem: There just aren\u2019t enough incentives to lure AI talent away from high-paying jobs with great benefits into a life of public service.\n\nThe future of AI\u2014and, by extension, the future of humanity\u2014is already controlled by just nine big tech titans, who are developing the frameworks, chipsets, and networks, funding the majority of research, earning the lion\u2019s share of patents, and, in the process, mining our data in ways that aren\u2019t transparent or observable. Six are in the US, and I call them the G-MAFIA: Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, IBM, and Apple. Three are in China, and they are the BAT: Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent.\n\nThe few government agencies built for innovation\u2014the US Digital Service, the US Army\u2019s Futures Command, the Defense Innovation Board, and the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) initiatives\u2014are brittle in their youth and subject to defunding and staff reductions as the revolving door of political appointees spins. In practical terms, there is too little strategic collaboration between the G-MAFIA and our government agencies or military offices\u2014at least not without a lucrative contract in place. While the G-MAFIA usually lobby for huge tax incentives and breaks to do business, they also must agree to the arcane, outdated procurement requirement policies of the military and government. This doesn\u2019t exactly accelerate AI in our national interest. If anything, it shines a bright light on the cultural differences between Silicon Valley and DC, and it slows down modernization.\n\nWashington and the G-MAFIA tend to view their relationship as transactional, not collaborative. During the past several years, neither lawmakers nor the White House has made an honest effort to develop the kind of relationships with G-MAFIA executives necessary for a long-term coalition on AI. The G-MAFIA, US military, and government circle around each other without ever converging in our national interest. Without collaboration, would-be researchers, scientists, and managers don\u2019t have the opportunity to meet each other, cultivate a network, and form the close relationships that typically lead to talent transfer between organizations like we typically see in other industries.\n\nIn my own meetings at the Pentagon with Department of Defense officials, an alternative view on the future of warfare (code vs. combat) has taken too long to find widespread alignment. For example, in 2017, the DOD established an Algorithmic Warfare Cross-Functional Team to work on something called Project Maven\u2014a computer vision and deep-learning system that autonomously recognizes objects from still images and videos. The team didn\u2019t have the necessary AI capabilities, so the DOD contracted with Google for help training AI systems to analyze drone footage. But no one told the Google employees assigned to the project that they\u2019d actually been working on a military project, and that resulted in high-profile backlash. Four thousand Google employees signed a petition objecting to Project Maven. They took out a full-page ad in The New York Times, and ultimately dozens of employees resigned. Eventually, Google said that it wouldn\u2019t renew its contract with the DOD.\n\nAmazon, too, came under fire because of a Pentagon contract worth $110 billion. In October 2018, House Appropriations Committee members Tom Cole (R-Oklahoma) and Steve Womack (R-Arkansas) accused the DOD of conspiring with Amazon to tailor the contract so that no other tech giant would qualify. But that wasn\u2019t the only complaint. There was a small wave of dissent at Amazon. Some Amazon workers were outraged that the company would do any work at all with the US military, while others didn\u2019t like that Amazon\u2019s facial recognition technology was being used by law enforcement. In response, Jeff Bezos told an audience at WIRED's own 25th anniversary conference, \u201cIf big tech companies are going to turn their back on the US Department of Defense, this country is going to be in trouble.\u201d\n\nBut who would come and work on AI for the federal government or US military when the perks of Silicon Valley are spectacularly more attractive? I\u2019ve had lunch in the Navy\u2019s Executive Dining Facility in the Pentagon and on the G-MAFIA\u2019s campuses. The Navy\u2019s dining room is smartly appointed, with insignias on the plates and a trim daily menu of meal options\u2014and, of course, there is always a chance you could wind up sitting next to a three- or four-star admiral. That being said, enlisted women and men don\u2019t get to eat in the Executive Dining Facility. People who work at the Pentagon have a choice of food courts with Subway, Panda Express, and Dunkin Donuts. I had a toasted panini once at the Center Court Caf\u00e9, which was dry but edible. The food on the G-MAFIA\u2019s campuses isn\u2019t remotely comparable: organic poke bowls at Google in New York and seared diver scallops with maitake mushrooms and squid-ink rice at Google\u2019s office in LA. For free.\n\nLEARN MORE The WIRED Guide to Artificial Intelligence\n\nFood isn\u2019t the only perk within the G-MAFIA. Just after Amazon\u2019s Spheres opened in Seattle, a friend took me on a tour of what is essentially an enormous greenhouse/workspace. The Spheres are just marvelous: climate-controlled, glass-enclosed, self-contained ecosystems made up of 40,000 species of plants from 30 different countries. The air is clean and fragrant, the temperature is around 72 degrees regardless of what the weather is like outside, and there are comfortable chairs, loungers, and tables all around. There\u2019s even an enormous tree house. Amazon staff are free to work in the Spheres anytime they want. I was once called into a meeting with some senior State Department officials. It was a drab, white, windowless room with creaky old chairs, a stained whiteboard, and an electronics cabinet outfitted with a VCR player.\n\nIf recent trends hold, the G-MAFIA looks like it offers the biggest perk of all: long-term job security. During the past two decades, the government seems to have weaponized the budget, and that has resulted in a record number of shutdowns. There were three in 2018 alone, one of which was the longest in US history. If you\u2019ve ever worked for a startup or a company that\u2019s in trouble, you\u2019ve had to live with the stress of not knowing whether you\u2019ll get your next paycheck. Paradoxically, that\u2019s one reason people go into public sector work: to avoid that kind of stress. Even with the promise of back pay, it seems as if every few weeks federal workers are now bracing for the next government shutdown or recouping from the previous one.\n\nMy point is this: It\u2019s really hard to make the case for a talented computer scientist to join the government or military, given the current political climate and what the G-MAFIA offer. The opportunity cost of civic duty is far too great in the United States to attract our best and brightest to serve the nation.\n\nThe center courtyard of the Pentagon isn\u2019t going to transform into the Spheres anytime soon. But the government can allocate significant funding\u2014several billion to start\u2014for basic and advanced research in AI. It can use some of that money for better compensation packages, to build capacity among existing staff, and to fund projects allowing the tech giants and public sector to start working much more closely together. Collaboration is in the best long-term interests of the G-MAFIA too. AI is a massive field, and there is plenty of work to be done.\n\nExcerpted from The Big Nine: How the Tech Titans and Their Thinking Machines Could Warp Humanity by Amy Webb.

    "title": "Instead of a Wall, Congress Puts Border Money Where It Counts",
    "description": "President Trump has yet to sign the bill. If he doesn't, another government shutdown looms.",
    "text": "After weeks\u2014years, really\u2014of debate over the Trump administration's proposed wall at the US-Mexico border, Congress will vote on a spending bill Thursday that includes $1.375 billion for 55 miles of border fence construction. In response, President Donald Trump signaled that he will declare a national emergency to get the wall built regardless. Doing so will create more problems than it solves.\n\nBeyond the politicization of a wall as a cure-all for immigration woes, border security experts continue to stress\u2014as they have since Trump's campaign days\u2014that a physical wall is simply not a practical or effective way to support law enforcement at the border. While human rights and privacy groups raise important concerns about alternatives like border-surveillance technologies, or the concept of a \"smart wall,\" the fact is that Democrats and Republicans in Congress largely agree on how to fund border patrol and enforcement technologies. And despite the pressures of a looming deadline that may yet again shut down the government, Capitol Hill has denied Trump the contiguous wall he has so adamantly championed.\n\n\"The wall is expensive and unnecessary given the current level of flow into the United States,\" says Alex Nowrasteh, senior immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute. \"These government mega-construction projects usually cost at least 50 percent more than what\u2019s budgeted. We estimate that each mile of wall would cost about $36 million to construct, and it won\u2019t have a major impact on deterrence, because most of the people coming are asking for asylum.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s at the ports of entry that we can do so much more than what we\u2019re doing.\" Christopher Wilson, Wilson Center\n\nThirty years ago, illegal border crossings at the border largely consisted of Mexican men trying to get into the US to find work. The billions of dollars the US has spent to date on physical barriers were founded in that reality. But today, despite Trump's \"bad hombres\" rhetoric, the majority of those approaching or attempting to cross the border are women and children seeking asylum. That often occurs at official points of entry anyway; when it doesn't, asylum seekers still generally intend to turn themselves in quickly.\n\nChristopher Wilson, deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center, says that these days the most constructive funding is for \"border security that isn\u2019t about the wall.\"\n\n\"A lot of it needs to go to the ports of entry rather than the areas between the ports of entry,\" Wilson says. \"It\u2019s at the ports of entry that we can do so much more than what we\u2019re doing, both in terms of facilitating legal travel and trade while enhancing border security.\"\n\nWilson notes that physical barriers at the border have historically been a helpful deterrent to marijuana trafficking, but that they are less effective at slowing the flow of high-potency drugs like the synthetic opioid fentanyl. These drugs can be trafficked in much smaller quantities and smuggled through legitimate points of entry like checkpoints, on airplanes, and in the mail. Cato's Nowrasteh calls the wall proposal \"yesterday\u2019s solution to yesterday\u2019s problem\u2014at best.\"\n\nPhysical barriers also don't eliminate criminal behavior; they just relocate it. \"If we rely on the wall to stop individuals, and we don't also improve detection methods through technology and response through personnel, then we will find routes across the border displaced rather than deterred,\" says Brandon Behlendorf, a homeland security researcher at SUNY-Albany. \"You also need technology\u2014cameras, sensors, databases, et cetera\u2014and personnel agents and support staff to secure the borders.\"\n\nThe widely varied geography and topography of the US-Mexico border also calls for a variety of protective measures. There's no one-wall-fits-all solution. In remote regions, where it takes time for enforcement personnel to respond to potentially illegal activity, physical barriers\u2014like the hundreds of miles of fencing that already exists at the border\u2014are relatively effective and help buy time for enforcement response. In areas where border personnel are based or have an established presence, such physical barriers can actually inhibit security efforts, making it logistically harder for agents to see what's going on and get to the right spots quickly.\n\n\"The border is a system constantly searching for its equilibrium.\" Brandon Behlendorf, SUNY-Albany\n\nTo that end, Thursday's 1,159-page spending bill earmarks three-quarters of a billion dollars for border security technology, of which $570 million must focus on \"non-intrusive inspection equipment at ports of entry.\" Customs and Border Protection and the Department of Homeland Security have been working for years to develop an array of border-security tech tools that include body scanners, cameras, infrared sensors, and radar deployed to collectively create a sort of invisible web or dome along and across the border. Sensors are positioned on the ground, on fences, on posts, and higher up through CBP's Integrated Fixed Towers program\u2014which is working on syncing and coordinating various types of sensors. Another crucial component is aerial monitoring from manned planes and helicopters, as well as drones and sensor-equipped blimps. Thursday's bill includes about $2.5 billion to be dispensed through 2023 on border-security-related vehicles, including drones.\n\n\"It does not fund the president\u2019s wall, but it does support smart border-security initiatives that both parties have always supported, including increased security at our ports of entry and humanitarian assistance at the border,\" said Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer on the floor Thursday. \"Most importantly, it will keep our government open.\"\n\nMost of all, the months and years spent arguing about a wall could have been much better spent implementing an array of border protections to be effective, but also humane and privacy-preserving. \"As you implement new technologies along the border, there are lots of important questions about how to go about doing it,\" the Wilson Center's Wilson says. \"Like is it collecting personal data that needs to be protected? It's kind of crazy that instead of having those important discussions we\u2019re having this wild political discussion about a wall.\"\n\nAnalysts also consistently emphasize the importance of seeing border security in the larger context of geopolitics and policy decisions. \"Border security is not a stand-alone thing,\" SUNY's Behlendorf says. \"It is part of a larger immigration and border-security system, and some of the most effective solutions to border security lie outside direct efforts to secure the border. Deploying technology is important, but so is reducing immigration court backlogs and improving legitimate entry into the United States, including asylum requests. The border is a system constantly searching for its equilibrium.\"\n\nMeanwhile, by declaring a national emergency over something that is clearly not one, Trump sets a dangerous precedent and unlocks executive authority that will likely face bipartisan pushback. It's unclear, though, whether anyone has the authority to stop him.\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories",

    "title": "Cybersecurity Workers Scramble to Fix a Post-Shutdown Mess",
    "description": "The shutdown may have ended two weeks ago, but federal cybersecurity professionals will be coping with its impact for a long time to come.",
    "text": "Two weeks out from the longest government shutdown in United States history\u2014and with the possibility of another still looming\u2014government employees are still scrambling to mitigate impacts on federal cybersecurity defenses. And the stakes are high.\n\nFurloughed cybersecurity employees returned to expired software licenses and web encryption certificates, colleagues burned out from working on skeleton crews, and weeks-worth of unanalyzed network activity logs. The job was already hard enough without having to play catch-up.\n\n\"There's tension in the air,\" says Christopher Kennedy, chief information security officer at the network security firm AttackIQ who spent more than 10 years as a federal security contractor for agencies like the Treasury, Department of Commerce and US Marines Corps. \"As an incident responder, you just found activity that took place three weeks ago, and now you have to quarantine and clean up and fix it when three weeks of damage has already been done. The work is harder and more chaotic and maybe your toolset doesn\u2019t work because a license is expired plus maybe people's security clearances have expired. All of those things are adding together.\"\n\nEven before the shutdown, the federal government was not known for a robust, consistent security posture. In a May report, the White House's Office of Management and Budget found that 74 percent of federal agencies are in urgent need of digital defense improvements. More than half don't have the ability to catalog the software that runs on their systems, and only about 25 percent of agencies confirmed to OMB that they are prepared to identify and thoroughly assess signs of data breaches.\n\nThe effects of the shutdown extend even to agencies that were funded throughout, like the military and intelligence community, thanks to interdependencies and network connections between agencies.\n\nOne of the few public-facing impacts of the shutdown was that web encryption certificates for numerous federal websites expired during the weeks of pause. This meant that people trying to access the sites, like NASA\u2019s rocket testing portal, may have gotten warnings from their browsers that the pages were unsafe. Other sites became completely inaccessible.\n\nThe shutdown could also become a sort of black hole of accountability for cybersecurity incidents.\n\nA bigger concern, though, is that the shutdown's true impact will take time to reckon with fully. Last week, Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar and five of her colleagues sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security and the NSA with questions about how federal cybersecurity posture fared during the shutdown. \"Experts have warned that our reduced capacity for cybersecurity during shutdowns provides an opportunity for adversaries and cybercriminals,\" the senators wrote. \"We are concerned that these circumstances have left our government and citizens vulnerable to cyberattacks.\" DHS and the NSA have not yet responded to the senators' questions.\n\nDigital threats, particularly those from nation state hackers, are not just a theoretical concern for the federal government. China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia all have active espionage and offensive hacking capabilities and many were ramping up their activity in the last year anyway, before the federal shutdown potentially created an opportunity for unchecked probing and intrusion. Such a prolonged stretch of reduced oversight would be virtually irresistible to foreign adversaries.\n\nThe shutdown also undermined the government's reputation as a stable and reliable employer\u2014a crucial issue given the general dearth of qualified cybersecurity personnel nationwide and the ongoing difficulty of competing with private sector jobs. Security professionals say that the shutdown was a prime recruiting season for private firms, and that many government employees and contractors left or plan to leave for other positions. New federal employment numbers haven't been released yet.\n\n\"Government employees have been busier than ever,\" says Carlos Perez, head of research and development at the IT security firm TrustedSec. \"Many are leaving so far.\"\n\nLEARN MORE The WIRED Guide to Data Breaches\n\nAttackIQ's Kennedy notes that the shutdown could also become a sort of black hole of accountability for cybersecurity incidents that began before, during, or even months after the break\u2014a disturbing idea given ongoing issues with holding agencies to account for cybersecurity lapses.\n\nThe only potential silver lining? The risk management firm SecurityScorecard suggests that threats like spearphishing may have been less effective during the shutdown, since furloughed employees literally weren't in the office to check their email.\n\nThough government employees and contractors who were furloughed have now spent more than two weeks rebuilding from the shutdown, it will be months or even years before the full toll of the incident is understood. And if another shutdown comes next week, count on erasing whatever little progress has been made.\n\nUpdated 2-11-19, 10:30 am ET: This story incorrectly identified Christopher Kennedy as CISO at RiskIQ; he has that position at AttackIQ.\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories",

    "title": "The Government's New Weather Model Faces a Storm of Protest",
    "description": "The National Weather Service will soon introduce a new forecasting model, but meteorologists are saying it's worse than its predecessor.",
    "text": "The government\u2019s new weather forecast model has a slight problem: It predicts that outside temperatures will be a few degrees colder than what nature delivers. This \u201ccold bias\u201d means that local meteorologists are abandoning the National Weather Service in favor of forecasts produced by British and European weather agencies.\n\nFor the past few weeks, the National Weather Service has been forecasting snowfall that ends up disappearing, according to Doug Kammerer, chief meteorologist at WRC-TV in Washington, DC. \u201cIt\u2019s just not performing well,\u201d Kammerer says. \u201cIt has continued to show us getting big-time snowstorms in this area, where the European model will not show it.\u201d\n\nThe new model, known as GFS-FV3 (Finite Volume on a Cubed Sphere dynamical core), has often overpredicted snow in the Northeast Corridor between Washington and Boston, a region where incorrect forecasts affect the lives of tens of millions of people.\n\nThe existing NWS forecast model, called the Global Forecast System, or GFS, has long been considered second in accuracy to the European models. Now Kammerer and others say the new FV3 upgrade is worse than the forecast model put out by our neighbors to the north. \u201cThe running joke now among meteorologists is that [the FV3] is looking more like the Canadian model,\u201d Kammerer says. For those not plugged into weather humor, apparently the Canadian model also predicts big snowstorms that ultimately vanish.\n\nThe FV3 was developed over the past three years by NOAA\u2019s Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory in Princeton, New Jersey. FV3 forecasts were released a few weeks ago for testing by local meteorologists, and many of them took to Twitter to complain about the results. \u201cI have no faith in the FV3 [for snowfall]\u201d, tweeted Boston-based Judah Cohen, a meteorologist at Atmospheric Environmental Research, a private firm that provides forecasts to commercial and government clients.\n\nOn Wednesday, the National Weather Service tweeted that the FV3 will be fully operational on March 20. But a NWS official told WIRED on Friday that the agency might push it back a few weeks because of all the complaints.\n\nThe FV3 upgrade uses an enhanced set of algorithms that have been developed in the past few years by climate scientists to describe the interaction between the atmosphere and the oceans. These algorithms, which capture the physics of cloud formation, tropical storms, and polar winds, among other things, are then populated with temperature data from satellites and surface observations to generate a three- or 10-day forecast.\n\n\u201cNo model is perfect,\u201d says David Novak, acting director of the NWS\u2019 National Center for Environmental Prediction. \u201cThe weather community knows this.\u201d Novak acknowledges that the FV3 has a \u201ccold bias\u201d and that the agency is working to fix it. \u201cIt tends to be colder than what is observed. It appears to be a systematic issue, we are doing our due diligence and investigating these reports.\u201d\n\nNovak says the 35-day government shutdown slowed final testing of the FV3. When federal climate scientists and programmers got back to work on January 25, the agency expected the model to be almost ready to go live. It looks like that deadline will now be pushed back.\n\nHe argues, however, that the FV3 isn\u2019t all bad. He says it produces more accurate forecasts of hurricane intensity and the jet stream, the current of high-altitude air around the northern hemisphere that drives much of the United States\u2019 weather patterns. \u201cWe found a lot of the good things,\u201d Novak says. \u201cWe do know there are some areas that may need additional improvement.\u201d\n\nNOAA recently signed an agreement with the National Center for Atmospheric Research, a Boulder-based research facility that also develops forecast models. Antonio Busalacchi, director of NCAR\u2019s parent agency, says he\u2019s optimistic that the new NWS model will get better over time. \u201cIt\u2019s premature to evaluate any one modeling system based on a snapshot with snowfall forecasts,\u201d Busalacchi says. \u201cOne needs to look at the totality of the system.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Busalacchi says that NWS and its parent agency, NOAA, might want to rely on help from academic scientists who are developing their own forecast models. \u201cWe want to get in a position where the research community and operational community are more collaborative than we have been in the past,\u201d he says.\n\nAs for Kammerer, he says he'll keep watching the new NWS model as he prepares his own forecast for the weather in Washington, DC. But maybe not for the next snow day.\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories",

    "title": "How the fight over vaccines is fueled by web forums",
    "description": "Facebook Groups promotes anti-vaccine communities \u2014\u00a0but Reddit is fighting back",
    "text": "The Interface is a daily column about the intersection of social media and democracy. Subscribe to the newsletter here .\n\nIn June 2017, Mark Zuckerberg rewrote Facebook\u2019s mission statement to better reflect its current priorities. In the future, he said, Facebook would have a strong focus on groups. Once you\u2019ve reached most of the adult population of earth, it turns out that they would rather all not gather in the same virtual room. And so Facebook has set about promoting the creation of all manner of groups, and last week during a groups-focused event rolled out a suite of new features for administrators.\n\nIn Bloomberg today, Selina Wang takes a look at the popular group Subtle Asian Traits, and considers what its growth means for the groups project overall.\n\nFast-growing meme and community groups have been a bright spot for Facebook over the past several months amid a series of privacy scandals and the company\u2019s own projections that people are spending less time on its namesake site. Subtle Asian Traits, while exceptionally popular, has origins typical of the genre: A group of Asian-Australian high school students, mostly first-generation immigrants, started it to distract themselves from exams. Screenshots of text exchanges with strict parents, photos of favorite childhood foods, and images that illustrate the difficulty of learning an Asian language usually attract thousands of likes and comments. \u201cWe\u2019ve grown up in this environment where we\u2019re the minority, and we don\u2019t really have a community,\u201d says group co-creator Anny Xie. \u201cIn this group, with a million other Asians, you\u2019re all having the same experience as a community.\u201d\n\nBut as Wang notes, groups have been just as vulnerable to hate speech, misinformation, and other woes that plague the News Feed. In the Guardian, Ed Pilkington and Jessica Glenza explore that downside, focusing on how anti-vaccination ghouls take advantage of Facebook\u2019s viral distribution to spread propaganda:\n\nFacebook is increasingly engaged in combatting misinformation that causes \u201creal-world harm\u201d. Yet despite the health risks, anti-vaccination propaganda is currently not treated as a breach of its content rules. The Guardian asked Facebook to respond to the proliferation of vaccine misinformation on its platform, but the company did not reply.\n\nIn a Twitter thread, misinformation researcher Renee DiResta blames the groups\u2019 rise on Facebook\u2019s recommendation algorithm. \u201cThe FB recommendation engine actively pushes the larger ones like Stop Mandatory Vaccination at new parents,\u201d she writes. \u201cIf you\u2019re in a mom group, you\u2019ll get antivax group recs.\u201d She went on: \u201cThis is where the platform has real power to change. Take them out of the [recommendation] engine. YouTube recognizes that proactively pushing conspiracy theories is harmful; Facebook has the same problem but still does it.\u201d\n\nUntil that happens, some children of anti-vaccination parents are taking matter into their own hands. Emily Moon reports that some nervous but resourceful young people are seeking advice ... from Reddit forums.\n\nWith this misinformation still thriving elsewhere on the Internet, forums like r/legaladvice are a rare safe haven. Even some of the harsher feedback has helped; Charly, who posted when she was 17 years old and living in Canada, said she began to question her parents\u2019 stance after seeing jokes and rants against anti-vaxxers on Reddit. \u201cI began to feel bad about my unvaccinated existence,\u201d she says. \u201cIt isn\u2019t the best reason, but it\u2019s truly what got to me.\u201d Like Charly\u2019s, many of the plaintive requests for advice contain a lot of shame. One unvaccinated user says they\u2019ve tried not to tell anyone. Another writes in the comments: \u201cYou have nothing to be ashamed of for your parents not vaccinating you. It wasn\u2019t something you researched and decided against, you were just doing the whole \u2018being a kid\u2019 thing.\u201d According to the CDC, \u201cbeing a kid\u201d should involve getting for vaccinated for 16 diseases. But for this group of teenagers, it means a regular flu and hours spent researching risks that don\u2019t exist. Two years after her post, Charly is no longer a kid: Now 19, she says she was able to follow through on the recommendations in the comments and get vaccinated.\n\nGroups on the internet: the cause of, and solution to, all of life\u2019s problems.\n\nDemocracy\n\nMaria Ressa, Philippine Journalist Critical of Rodrigo Duterte, Is Arrested\n\nMaria Ressa, a crusading pro-democracy journalist in the Philippines, has been arrested on trumped-up charges by the Duterte regime. It\u2019s tremendously worrying:\n\nMs. Ressa\u2019s arrest is the most dramatic sign yet of Mr. Duterte\u2019s crackdown on the news media in the Philippines. Mr. Duterte has not tried to hide his disdain for journalists, calling reporters \u201csons of bitches\u201d and \u201cspies\u201d and even warning that they are \u201cnot exempted from assassination.\u201d As she left the building flanked by police officers, Ms. Ressa addressed reporters, telling them, \u201cI will do the right thing.\u201d\n\nCalifornia Governor Proposes Digital Dividend Aimed at Big Tech\n\nHere\u2019s an idea that I hope gets a thorough public airing: incoming California Governor Gavin Newsom is proposing a \u201cdigital dividend\u201d that would pay consumers for the data that they give to tech companies:\n\n\u201cCalifornia\u2019s consumers should also be able to share in the wealth that is created from their data,\u201d Newsom said. \u201cAnd so I\u2019ve asked my team to develop a proposal for a new data dividend for Californians, because we recognize that data has value and it belongs to you.\u201d Newsom didn\u2019t describe what form the dividend might take, although he said \u201cwe can do something bold in this space.\u201d He also praised a tough California data-privacy law that will kick in next year.\n\nFacebook\u2019s Most Intriguing New Hires Aren\u2019t in Silicon Valley \u2014 They\u2019re in Washington\n\nPatrick Howell O\u2019Neill catalogs the ex-government workers who are being rapidly absorbed into Facebook\u2019s Washington office:\n\nSeveral of Facebook\u2019s recent hires come straight out of Capitol Hill. Joshua Althouse, who previously served as outreach director for former House Speaker Paul Ryan, is now a policy manager at Facebook. Senator Gary Peters, the Democrat from Michigan and ranking member of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, saw staffer Sydney Paul leave to become a newly minted policy manager at Facebook as of January 2019. Chris Randle, previously the legislative director for Hakeem Jeffries, a Democratic congressman from New York, now works on government affairs at Facebook. Facebook also recently hired Melinda Claybaugh, a veteran of the Federal Trade Commision, just as that agency is considering record-setting finesagainst Facebook for failing to protect user privacy. Claybaugh is now a Privacy Policy Director in Facebook\u2019s Washington operation.\n\nWhen Facebook Spread Hate, One Cop Tried Something Unusual\n\nMax Fisher and Amanda Taub report on the German cop who went door to door to quash a fake rumor that could have endangered the town\u2019s Muslim community:\n\nMr. Guske\u2019s team members do not arrest people who post inflammatory rumors, or fine them. Instead, they act more like public health workers, inoculating communities from viral misinformation and its consequences. Their efforts reflect rising concern among governments that Facebook is spinning up violence and extremism. They also reflect a lack of faith in the company to address the problem.\n\nIndia Targets Facebook `Evil\u2019 in Backlash Against U.S. Giants\n\nSaritha Rai examines the growing pressure on Facebook to let the Indian government monitor WhatsApp, possibly by breaking its encryption:\n\nFrustrated that the service has been used to incite violence and spread pornography, the government is pressing WhatsApp to allow more official oversight of online discussions, even if that means giving officials access to protected, or encrypted, messages. Facebook has refused, risking punitive measures or even the possibility of a shutdown in its biggest market. \u201cFor six months, we\u2019ve been telling them to bring more accountability to their platform but what have they done?\u201d said Gopalakrishnan S., a senior official in the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology known as MEITY. \u201cSo pedophiles can go about on WhatsApp fully secure that they won\u2019t get caught. It is absolutely evil.\u201d\n\nIndian Lawmakers Call for TikTok Ban Due to \u2018Cultural Degeneration\u2019\n\nTikTok appears to be triggering a moral panic in India, Jennings Brown reports:\n\nM. Manikandan\u2014the information technology minister of the Indian state Tamil Nadu\u2014said on Monday the state government will recommend the app be banned in Tamil Nadu, according to the Economic Times. The statement was a response to state legislator Thamimun Ansari. The Hindustan Times reports that Ansari said young users get hooked on the app, which is pushing them down \u201cthe path of cultural degeneration.\u201d He referenced posts that are sexually explicit, and content that alters people\u2019s faces\u2014seemingly a reference to deepfakes.\n\nChina\u2019s Tencent Invests in Reddit, Sparking Free Speech Protests\n\nJulie Verhage reports that not everyone is excited about Reddit\u2019s big new Chinese investor:\n\nIn the following days, users posted links to Reddit depicting imagery banned by Chinese censors. They include video of the Tiananmen Square protestand pictures comparing President Xi Jinping to the portly Winnie the Pooh. Reddit users swarmed several of the submissions, pushing them to the list of most popular posts.\n\nPro-Trump Activists Are Boosting A Twitter App Used By Banned Personalities And It Appears To Have Already Stalled\n\nParler News is a new platform for people who have banned from Twitter, and if there is a more hilarious business idea than that one I have yet to hear it:\n\nThe Parler app appears to mimic Twitter in its functionality and design. Users can post updates onto a scrolling feed, although with a 1,000 character limit compared to Twitter\u2019s limit of 240, they are free to be more long-winded. Other users can \u201cvote\u201d on posts to indicate approval or \u201cecho\u201d it, which is similar to a retweet.\n\nEight Ways We\u2019re Preparing for Elections Across Africa\n\nFacebook describes what it\u2019s doing in advance of elections in Africa:\n\nIn Nigeria, WhatsApp has launched its \u201cShare Facts, Not Rumours\u201d campaign to help increase awareness about hoaxes. Additionally, at the end of last year Facebook began a new Online Safety Programme for students in Nigerian secondary schools. The 12-week workshop is designed to help teenagers understand the fundamentals of online safety and digital literacy, covering topics such as managing an online presence; social media and sharing; public Wi-Fi safety; building healthy relationships online; understanding password security and privacy settings; and identifying misinformation online.\n\nElsewhere\n\nU.K. Doctors Call for Caution in Children\u2019s Use of Screens and Social Media\n\nBritain\u2019s chief medical officers are warning young people not to spend too much time looking at their phones, Palko Karasz reports:\n\nThe University College London paper found that lengthy social media use could have a negative effect on sleep patterns, self-esteem and body image, and expose young people to online harassment. \u201cWe showed that these were linked to depressive symptoms,\u201d Yvonne Kelly, a professor of epidemiology and public health at University College who is an author of the study, said in a phone interview on Thursday.\n\nInstagram is investigating glitch that\u2019s causing massive follower loss\n\nMassive follower loss \u2026 the three most terrifying words in the English language.\n\nScammers Are Filing Fake Trademarks to Steal High-Value Instagram Accounts\n\nJoseph Cox reports on the latest method by which fraudsters are separating people from their Instagram accounts:\n\nScammers do this by creating fake companies and trademarks to convince Instagram they should be the legitimate owner of a username in question, with fraudsters using \u201ctrademarking,\u201d as the technique is known, to get ahold of sought-after, valuable handles, according to posts and evidence of the process in action obtained by Motherboard. The scammers can then keep these handles as digital mementos, brag about their acquisition, or resell them at a profit in a thriving underground community.\n\nAmerica\u2019s most generous billionaires gave half as much to charity in 2018 as in the previous year\n\nMark Zuckerberg\u2019s personal giving fell from $2 billion in 2017 to $200 million last year, Teddy Schleifer reports.\n\nLaunches\n\nTwitter is testing a pop-up mini profile inside of threads\n\nSure, why not.\n\nInstagram is testing direct messages for the web\n\nFinally!

Quiz Date Live is here for you, Ashley Carman reports:\n\nA new app\u2019s creators think they know the key to dating success: a trivia-oriented game show where the questions revolve around a bachelorette. It\u2019s a unique idea, for sure, albeit one that I can\u2019t imagine having wide appeal. The game, called Quiz Date Live, comes from a company called East Meets East, which has raised $4 million in funding to get its iOS show off the ground. The team plans to monetize in a way similar to the mobile HQ game show by giving users the option to purchase extra lives. The game has two parts, and the second part has three rounds. Try to stick with me while I explain.\n\nTakes\n\nHow hard is it to have a conversation on Twitter? So hard even the CEO can\u2019t do it.\n\nKara Swisher invited Jack Dorsey to make a stop on his podcast tour with her, and he countered with an offer to tweet back and forth with her for an hour and a half. What followed was basically unreadable, thanks to various quirks of Twitter\u2019s platform. I have rarely been contacted by so many ex-Twitter employees asking me whether I can even believe Jack proposed this. (I can.) Here\u2019s Kurt Wagner:\n\nDespite the public interview and a dedicated hashtag (#karajack) for the event, it didn\u2019t take long before the dozens of tweets between the two started to get confusing. They were listed out of order, other users started chiming in, and there was no way to properly follow the conversation thread. Swisher\u2019s questions about Twitter\u2019s complex abuse policies and Dorsey\u2019s subsequent responses were floating around my timeline along with the regular tech news and opinions I always look at.

It made for a difficult and confusing experience.\n\nGoogle Workers Lost a Leader, But the Fight Will Continue\n\nLiz Fong-Jones, who helped to pioneer the art of angrily tweeting about your own employer and not getting fired for it, reflects on leaving Google after 11 years:\n\nThe approaches that I used during my time at Google to advocate for vulnerable people, including women, people of color, and LGBT+ people, have become less effective as leadership repeatedly stonewalls employees who privately raise concerns. Google will need to fundamentally change how it is run in order to win back the trust of workers and prevent a catastrophic loss of long-tenured employees, especially those from vulnerable groups.\n\nWhy Amazon buying Eero feels so disappointing\n\nDieter Bohn says Amazon\u2019s acquisition of a home networking company feels like yet another case where the absence of competition-minded regulators is pushing us into a world where it is impossible to live without patronizing four big companies:\n\nWe all feel trapped \u2014 or maybe captured \u2014 by the various ecosystems we live in. We all use excellent products every day made by behemoth companies, but increasingly only made by those companies. iPhone or Android, Chrome or Safari, Surface or Mac, Windows or Chrome OS, and even Facebook or Twitter: all, in one way or another, come from one of the big guys. Eero was different. It was a tiny little company that made a great little product. Something simple, elegant, and reliable. Would it have been too much to ask that it stay independent? Perhaps, but we don\u2019t know Eero\u2019s financial situation. But it\u2019s getting harder to find independent hardware startups that can scale up to something big without getting bought.\n\nAnd finally ...\n\nI can\u2019t tweet for one week and it\u2019s killing me\n\nBrandy Jensen got suspended from Twitter for telling a joke and finds it\u2019s hard to be without:\n\nThis is obviously an absurd situation. Much, much worse has been said and is currently being said on the hellsite. But I am not the first person this has happened to, nor will I be the last. But this is my story, and I realize the irony of my situation: that all I want to do is tweet about how I cannot tweet.

    "text": "The UK\u2019s Department for Transport has said today that an expansion of drone \u2018no-fly\u2019 zones to 5km around airport runways will come into force on March 13.\n\nAnyone caught and convicted of flying a drone inside the restricted zones could face a fine and years in prison.\n\nLast month the government said it would tighten restrictions on drones flights around airports, after the existing 1km limit was criticized for being inadequate \u2014 saying it believes expanded no-fly zones will help protect airports from drone misuse.\n\nThe 1km drone exclusion zone around airports, and a 400ft drone flight height restriction rule, only came into force last July. But ministers came in for sharp criticism following the Gatwick Airport drone fiasco when a spate of drone sightings near the UK\u2019s second busiest airport caused a temporary shutdown of the runway and travel disruption for thousands of people right before Christmas.\n\nHeathrow, the UK\u2019s busiest airport, also briefly halted departures after further sightings of drones last month.\n\n\u201cThe law is clear that flying a drone near an airport is a serious criminal act. We\u2019re now going even further and extending the no-fly zone to help keep our airports secure and our skies safe,\u201d said transport secretary, Chris Grayling, in a statement today.\n\n\u201cWe are also working to raise awareness of the rules in place. Anyone flying their drone within the vicinity of an airport should know they are not only acting irresponsibly, but criminally, and could face imprisonment.\u201d\n\nThe government and the Civil Aviation Authority have announced a partnership with online retailer Jessops to help raise public awareness about the new drone rules \u2014 and encourage what they dub \u201cresponsible drone use\u201d \u2014 as part of a national awareness campaign.\n\nThe government also said work is continuing on a new Drones Bill. Although the planned legislation is already almost a year behind schedule \u2014 and is still only slated for introduction \u201cin due course\u201d.\n\nThe bill will give police officers powers to stop and search people suspected of using drones maliciously above 400ft or within 5km of an airport, the government said.\n\nIt added that the planned legislation will give additional new powers to the police to clamp down on those misusing drones and other small unmanned aircraft, including the power to access electronic data stored on a drone with a warrant.\n\nAdditional powers for police were trailed back in 2017 when the drone bill was first floated by the government. It re-announced its intention to beef up police powers to tackle drone misuse last month following the Gatwick fiasco.\n\nThe government added today that the Home Office is still reviewing the UK\u2019s approach to countering the malicious use of drones, writing that it will \u201cconsider how best to protect the full range of the UK \u2019s critical national infrastructure \u2014 including testing and evaluating technology to counter drones\u201d.\n\nIn related news this month, drone maker DJI announced upgrades to its geofencing systems across Europe \u2014 applying stricter and more detailed restrictions around airports and other sensitive sites after switching its mapping data provider from US based AirMap to UK based Altitude Angel.",

    "text": "Photo: Getty / John Moore\n\nA spending bill expected to pass the House and Senate on Thursday, and then be signed by President Trump before this weekend to avert another disastrous government shutdown, contains at least $100 million earmarked for the development of surveillance technologies such as unmanned aerial drones and facial recognition systems, according to a summary of the bill released Wednesday.\n\n\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi last month criticized President Trump\u2019s proposed border wall as an \u201can immorality,\u201d senior Democrats have touted the expansion of border surveillance, eagerly juxtaposing plans for new drones, license plate readers, and infrared sensors with Trump\u2019s physical barrier of concrete or steel\u2014a useful brush with which to paint the GOP\u2019s security proposals as antiquated, obsolete, and even \u201cmedieval.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday said that Trump would sign the spending bill, adding that he\u2019d also throw his support behind the president\u2019s plan to declare a national emergency in an attempt to circumvent Congress and pull funding from other sources, including the Defense Department. In January, it was widely reported that the White House was examining ways to divert disaster recovery and military construction funds, including unspent money earmarked for disaster recovery in multiple states and Puerto Rico, where nearly 3,000 people died during and in the wake of Hurricane Maria.\n\nIn a statement, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Trump would sign the bill and take executive action, \u201cincluding a national emergency.\u201d\n\nAccording to an explanatory statement submitted Wednesday by House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey, the $100 million will provide for a range of technologies, such as fixed towers, remote video surveillance systems, mobile surveillance capabilities, and a host of \u201cground detection\u201d capabilities, including video surveillance and small unmanned aerial systems. The statement notes carryover funding totaling $200 million has been similarly allocated and will also address the \u201ccross border tunnel threat.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCollectively, these measures have been labeled by Democrats a \u201ctechnological wall\u201d or \u201csmart wall\u201d or \u201cvirtual fence.\u201d\n\nAdditional funding will go toward a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) program that the Trump administration sought to shutter two years ago in order to free up money for a physical barrier: The VIPR program\u2014or Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response\u2014a series of security check teams intended to deter terrorism by creating a highly visible law enforcement presence, first at airports, and later in the transit systems of several major U.S. cities.\n\n\u201cWe know that the border is often a testing ground for surveillance technology that is later deployed throughout the United States.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe VIPR program, which saw its funding slashed in half over the last half-decade, has long been criticized by privacy experts due to repeated incidents in which officers showed flagrant disregard for Fourth Amendment protections. In a famous example of this, a VIPR team once seized control of an Amtrak station in Savannah, Georgia, and conducted warrantless searches of every citizen in sight, passengers who were both arriving and departing the station. The 2011 incident led Amtrak\u2019s police chief to temporarily bar Transportation and Security Administration (TSA) employees from the premises.\n\nThe funding bill agreed upon by the Democrats and the GOP is said to include $55,637,000 to maintain 31 VIPR teams.\n\nThe bill further includes funding for the Silicon Valley Innovation Program, a research and development initiative headed by DHS. The program will receive $10 million to fund \u201cnew technologies that strengthen national security.\u201d The funds go to companies with fewer than 200 employees involved in research largely geared toward increasing DHS and Customs and Border Protection surveillance capabilities. At least six companies are currently developing drones with the money, including some incorporating machine learning and voice recognition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlanck Aerosystems out of San Diego, California, for example, is reportedly developing a \u201ca fully autonomous, truck-based, search, surveillance, and data delivery platform for DHS applications operated from a dash-mounted user interface which delivers real-time video and object detection to drivers and passengers, without the need for a dedicated pilot or extensive operator training.\u201d Another, Kiana Analytics, is said to be developing a \u201csmartphone based interview capability that includes the remote identity verification of travelers using a combination of biometric information and behavior/trend analysis from sensors available in remote ports of entry used by travelers.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, a coalition of digital- and immigrant-rights groups delivered petitions signed by thousands of Americans to Washington opposing the Democrats\u2019 plan to expand surveillance at the border as an alternative to wall construction\u2014which the White House insists it intends to do anyway without Congress\u2019 approval.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sickening to see both Republicans and Democrats add significant funding for invasive surveillance technologies to trample on millions of people\u2019s basic rights at a mass scale,\u201d said Evan Greer, deputy director of Fight for the Future, one of the groups involved in the protest alongside Access Now, Free Press Action, Demand Progress, and RAICES, the nation\u2019s largest immigration legal services non-profit, among others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwenty-eight technology and human rights organizations wrote to congressional leaders last week asking them not to fund privacy-invasive technology, some of which may be used at internal checkpoints found in an area extending 100 miles from the actual border. The letter expressed particular concern over technology such as license plate readers, drones, and technology designed to collect biometric and DNA data on immigrants and U.S. citizens alike. The groups called instead for \u201crobust oversight of government surveillance technology already deployed at the border,\u201d saying the development or funding of any new technology should be \u201ccontingent upon independent certification\u201d that it will not adversely impact Americans\u2019 privacy rights.\n\n\u201cWe know that the border is often a testing ground for surveillance technology that is later deployed throughout the United States,\u201d the letter said. \u201cUbiquitous surveillance technology poses a serious threat to human rights and constitutional liberties.\u201d\n\nCorrection: A typo in a previous version of this article incorrectly identified House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as the \u201cWhite House Speaker,\u201d a job title that doesn\u2019t exist.",

    "text": "Photo: White House/Flickr\n\nPresident Donald Trump reportedly plans to sign an executive order today creating something called the American AI Initiative. The executive order is apparently a symbolic nod to artificial intelligence that doesn\u2019t create any new funding but encourages the federal government to do more with AI. And we can\u2019t help but wonder, what are the odds that President Trump knows anything about what he\u2019s signing today?\n\n\n\nWe don\u2019t even mean to be snarky or mean by asking the question. But it\u2019s worth asking given the president\u2019s dangerous incompetence and complete lack of intellectual curiosity. Does President Trump, someone who regularly insists that he knows a lot about technology but has used a computer maybe twice in his entire life, have any idea what he\u2019s signing later today? Do you think Trump could describe in even the most basic terms what his new American AI Initiative seeks to accomplish? As reported by multiple news outlets, the American AI Initiative is simply a \u201cstrategy\u201d to get the federal government more involved in artificial intelligence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe executive order will seek to \u201credirect\u201d existing funding, but it\u2019s not clear where that funding will be \u201credirected\u201d from. All we know for sure is that it won\u2019t be redirected from billionaires. They already got a huge tax break in one of the largest transfers of wealth from the poor to the rich in modern history. If nothing else, the White House seems to have provided plenty of meaningless buzzwords about the AI endeavor.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to be developing principles and an agenda with American values in mind,\u201d one anonymous Trump regime official told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cThat is something we\u2019re excited to share with the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis executive order is about ensuring continued America leadership in AI, which includes ensuring AI technologies reflect American values, policies, and priorities,\u201d an anonymous official told Axios.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAI is something that touches every aspect of people\u2019s lives. What this initiative attempts to do is to bring all those together under one umbrella and show the promise of this technology for the American people,\u201d an anonymous Trump regime official told Reuters.\n\nWhat does any of that mean? Your guess is as good as ours. And we expect to hear precisely as much stirring detail about it after President Trump signs the thing later today. What are the odds that Trump\u2019s aides simply said the words \u201cit\u2019s to fight China\u201d and Trump said okay before turning his attention back to Fox News? Pretty good.\n\nIf it seems like you\u2019re seeing the news of President Trump\u2019s executive order everywhere this morning, that\u2019s by design. News organizations all hit publish on their stories at midnight, presumably because the White House approached them with a news \u201cembargo.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome of the headlines that news organizations went with overnight:\n\nThe stated purpose of a news embargo is to allow news organizations time to talk with experts and get an independent opinion without rushing a story to press. Gizmodo honors embargoes all the time, especially for science coverage. But embargoes are often used for cynical, public relations purposes. And this appears to be a case of the latter. It\u2019s almost as if the White House was able to press \u201cpublish\u201d on half a dozen press releases simultaneously, all while keeping the government sources completely anonymous for some reason.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s genuinely strange that the Trump regime is able to get away with this kind of control over news in an environment where they\u2019ve ruined so much. The president has been exposed as arguably the most corrupt politician of the past 100 years as he continues to profit from his position in countless ways and his own lawyer is going to jail for something that the president instructed him to do. Not to mention that President Trump has overseen some of the most barbaric human rights violations on American soil in recent memory through his immigrant family separation policy\u2014something that Trump regime members still insist isn\u2019t an actual policy despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.\n\nTwo children have even died in government custody in recent months and countless others are enduring systematic child abuse through the country\u2019s concentration camps for asylum seekers. And yet everything is moving along like normal. The White House still issues news embargoes and media organizations still publish what the White House wants them to publish precisely when the White House wants them to publish it.\n\nAnd to make matters even more strange, congressional talks have apparently broken down and America is headed toward another government shutdown on February 15 over the president\u2019s racist border wall with Mexico.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, it seems like it\u2019s going to be another of those weeks. But if we\u2019re being honest with ourselves every week is one of those weeks now.",

    "text": "Photo: Getty\n\nAmericans broke a new record last year, but it\u2019s nothing to write home about. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) found 4,239 firearms in carry-on luggage in 2018, breaking the previous record that was set in 2017. That\u2019s an average of more than 11 guns per day.\n\n\n\nThe number of guns found by TSA in 2018 was up roughly 7 percent from 2017, when 3,957 were found at TSA checkpoints, as the agency notes in a press release. But the most disturbing statistic might be that 86 percent of the guns discovered last year by TSA were loaded. Even more shocking, according to the TSA, \u201cnearly 34 percent had a bullet in the chamber.\u201d Yikes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the TSA:\n\nThe top five airports where TSA officers detected guns at checkpoints in 2018 were: Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International with 298; Dallas/Fort Worth International with 219; Phoenix Sky Harbor International with 129; Denver International with 126 and Orlando International at 123.\n\nAmericans are able to legally fly with firearms, but they must be unloaded and locked away in checked luggage. Even replica guns and toy guns are required by federal law to be in checked luggage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrying to carry a gun on a plane is considered a civil rather than criminal matter under federal regulations, and if you\u2019re caught you face fines of up to $13,000. But TSA agents don\u2019t actually seize the guns that they find. That\u2019s the job of local police.\n\n\u201cI like to call it firearm detections,\u201d TSA regional spokesperson Mark J. Howell told Gizmodo over the phone. \u201cWhen we find those firearms we shut that lane down until law enforcement comes over. They remove the firearm from the machine and remove the person from the checkpoint.\u201d\n\nWhether local law enforcement simply cite the person with the gun or arrest them is up to the state law. But either way, the gun owner is going to get slapped with a federal fine.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe collect the information from [the gun owner] and we issue the civil penalty to them in the mail afterwards,\u201d Howell says, adding that it takes about a month for those citations to go out. \u201cAny confiscation is a determination made by law enforcement.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of them you have to go to court to get [the gun] back, others get them back right there, but that determination is made by local law enforcement.\u201d\n\nThe TSA\u2019s latest release also includes a breakdown of the past decade, which is fairly depressing. Back in 2008, just 928 guns were found by TSA agents nationwide. And the numbers have gotten worse every year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2018\u20144,239\n\n\n\n2017\u20143,957\n\n\n\n2016\u20143,391\n\n\n\n2015\u20142,653\n\n\n\n2014\u20142,212\n\n\n\n2013\u20141,813\n\n\n\n2012\u20141,556\n\n\n\n2011\u20141,320\n\n\n\n2010\u20141,123\n\n\n\n2009\u2014976\n\n\n\n2008\u2014926\n\n\n\nAmericans love guns in a way that\u2019s incredibly uncommon in the developed world. And as long as they\u2019re legal\u2014remember when President Obama was supposed to take everyone\u2019s guns away?\u2014they\u2019re going to be something that air travelers will live with for some time to come.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe best you can hope for is that guns don\u2019t make it through security, like they did recently in Atlanta. A woman got through TSA with a gun at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport on January 3 of this year and made it all the way to Japan\u2019s Narita International Airport in Tokyo with the weapon, according to The Washington Post.\n\nAt first, some people speculated that it might have to do with the government shutdown, but the TSA pushed back on that suggestion, stating that \u201cthe national call out rate was higher a year ago than this year on that date.\u201d It\u2019s just really hard to catch every gun that\u2019s going through America\u2019s airports. There\u2019s at least 11 every day, and if the past decade is any guide, that number is only going to be higher in 2019.",

And Ralph Northam was in medical school! I know medical students aren\u2019t all the omni-dedicated healers we saw on \u201cE.R.\u201d But good grief.\n\nBret: I don\u2019t know if we really differ. But I think context and intention matter. Billy Crystal did \u201cblackface\u201d for a Sammy Davis Jr. impression, and I don\u2019t think Crystal is racist in any respect. Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel and Sarah Silverman, to name a few boldface names, have all done blackface. If we\u2019re going to start excommunicating people from public life for this, we\u2019re going to destroy a lot of people who almost surely intended no harm.\n\nGail: Yeah, but I don\u2019t remember Billy Crystal doing his act with a guy wearing a sheet.\n\nBret: That\u2019s true. And I think that\u2019s in a different league in terms of offensiveness. But again, I think we need to better understand the context, whether it was connected to a pattern of behavior, and whether it was ever repeated. And again, we are talking about an incident from 35 years ago followed by an admirable life without any hint of racial bias.\n\nRight now, Northam\u2019s real moral jeopardy is that he has contradicted himself and is doing a duck-and-cover move. He has a good opportunity to rise above it, first by clarifying how exactly that photo ended up on his yearbook page \u2014 and whether he\u2019s one of the people in the picture, as he now claims he isn\u2019t \u2014 and then by explaining why the casual racism of a past generation mustn\u2019t be communicated to the present.\n\nGail: I do find it hard to believe he looked at that picture and said: \u201cWho are these people? How did they get in my yearbook?\u201d He\u2019d be a gone goose now if the Legislature wasn\u2019t busy talking about trying to impeach the lieutenant governor over some terrible allegations of sexual assault.\n\nDid you know Virginia has, for all practical purposes, a one-term limit for governors? I\u2019m wondering if that has anything to do with all these crises.",

Democrats strenuously dispute that there is a national security crisis on the border that warrants using the kind of presidential authority that in the past has been used for grave matters like the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.\n\nHere are six takeaways from Mr. Trump\u2019s action.\n\nTrump will go to almost any length to appease his base\n\nRepublicans in Congress, including Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, were fine with the spending deal that they reached with Democrats to keep the government open.\n\nBut more hard-line elements within the party scalded Mr. Trump with criticism, including the Fox host Laura Ingraham and the conservative commentator Ann Coulter. But as The New York Times reported early Friday, the president felt cornered into accepting the deal and agreed to it only with Mr. McConnell\u2019s promise to support an emergency declaration.",

    "text": "It should go without saying that our national health relies on a grown-up relationship between the president and the speaker of the House. But Donald Trump and Nancy Pelosi are more like the Wile E. Coyote and Road Runner of American politics, our Karen and Jack, our Alexis Carrington and Dominique Deveraux, our Ren and Stimpy. She has been speaker for roughly two months of his presidency, but it\u2019s as if they\u2019ve been on the Cartoon Network for 20 years. He tries to drop an anvil on her. She lures him over a cliff. We care about the nation\u2019s health, but we seem to enjoy the anvil business even more.\n\nLook at the visual highlight of the State of the Union address. It\u2019s only a few seconds long \u2014 Trump turning to absorb Pelosi\u2019s smirking spin on a routine stand-and-clap \u2014 but it proved more noteworthy than the hour-plus of speechifying. It comes at about eight minutes in. The president\u2019s on an alliterative high, talking about rejecting the \u201cpolitics of revenge, resistance and retribution.\u201d When he gets to the part about embracing \u201cthe boundless potential of cooperation, compromise and the common good,\u201d the room erupts in approval.\n\nBut something tells Trump to turn around. He rotates toward Pelosi, who has thus far been clapping tepidly, here and there, when not inspecting her paper copy of the speech the way people search certain restaurant menus for something they can eat. What Trump glimpses is stranger and more pointed than Pelosi\u2019s previous handwork. Now she is extending her arms all the way out, toward him, applauding him the way you might applaud a little kid who wants credit for behavior that warrants none or a dad proudly announcing that he has finally changed a single diaper.",

    "text": "That\u2019s not only bad for immigrants who, as a result of militarized borders are more likely to be kidnapped, violently assaulted and driven to cross via the lethal desert. It\u2019s also bad for Democrats, who are handing ammunition to the nativist right at a time when Republicans are on the back foot and polls show that Democratic voters are moving decidedly leftward on immigration and the border.\n\n[Sign up for Crossing the Border, a limited-run newsletter about life where the United States and Mexico meet.]\n\nVoters used to overwhelmingly favor less immigration, but opinions have changed fast amid an immigrant rights movement that took off in 2006 and partisan polarization driven by aggressive enforcement. In 1994, just 32 percent of Democrats and Democratic-leaning Americans and 30 percent of Republicans agreed that immigrants strengthened the country, according to the Pew Research Center. But by 2016, the share of Democrats who said so had skyrocketed to 78 percent. In 2006, 37 percent of Democrats said that immigration levels should be decreased, while only 20 percent said that it should be increased. In 2018, 40 percent said that it should be increased, with just 16 percent calling for restriction. The same trend has held on border politics: In 2010, 47 percent of Democrats said that they equally prioritized legalizing undocumented immigrants and \u201cbetter border security and stronger enforcement of immigration laws,\u201d while just 29 percent prioritized legalization alone. By 2018, the number prioritizing legalization alone skyrocketed to 51 percent.\n\nUnder President Trump, polarization has accelerated \u2014 and that\u2019s a good thing. The vanishing bipartisan consensus orchestrated mammoth deportations and militarized the border in the quixotic hope of placating the nativist right and winning it over to supporting immigration reform. This strategy only inflamed the right\u2019s paranoiac ravings and helped move the goal posts to new extremes. Which is why we find ourselves, in 2019, with the possibility of beginning a second government shutdown over the wall.\n\nSo, what should the Democrats pursue instead? A break with a failed bipartisan consensus.\n\nRepresentatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley and Rashida Tlaib, all Democrats who are new to the House, have drafted a letter urging opposition to any deal that increases Department of Homeland Security funding in any form. That\u2019s a good start.\n\nThe border must be demilitarized, which would include demolishing the already-existing wall and dramatically downsizing the Border Patrol. Criminal sanctions on illegal entry and re-entry must be repealed. Opportunities for legal immigration, particularly from Mexico and Central America, must be expanded. The right to asylum must be honored. And citizenship for those who reside here must be a stand-alone cause, unencumbered by compromises that are not only distasteful but also politically ineffectual \u2014 and that today would provoke opposition from the nativist right and the grass-roots left. If Democrats stick to the center on immigration, they will find themselves fighting on two fronts. A fight against Republicans, with the left at their back, will be far easier to win \u2014 and a more noble victory.\n\nSimple realism dictates that no legislation to grant citizenship to the millions of undocumented Americans who deserve it will be passed until the Republicans are defeated. There\u2019s no use trying to appease them. The bipartisan consensus supporting harsh immigration and border enforcement has fractured. Democratic elected officials need to catch up.\n\nDaniel Denvir (@danieldenvir) is a visiting fellow at the Watson Institute for International and Public Affairs at Brown University and the author of the forthcoming \u201cAll-American Nativism.\u201d He also hosts \u201cThe Dig,\u201d a podcast from Jacobin magazine.",

    "text": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump intends to sign the border security deal to avoid another partial government shutdown, according to two sources who have spoken directly with the President.\n\nTrump said Tuesday that he was \"not happy\" with the tentative deal reached by congressional negotiators late Monday night that falls far short of his original demands.\n\nOn Wednesday, he told reporters he would \"take a very serious look\" at the legislation, adding that he does not want the government to shut down again.\n\nCongress faces a deadline to get a deal passed and signed by Trump before Friday.\n\nThe agreement, which includes $1.375 billion for a border barrier, falls well short of the $5.7 billion Trump originally demanded for a wall. It even falls short of the $1.6 billion included in a Senate package last year.\n\nStill, the measure would avert another government shutdown. Polls showed Trump was largely blamed for the previous 35-day impasse.\n\n\"I don't want to see a shutdown, a shutdown would be a terrible thing,\" the President said during a Wednesday Oval Office meeting with Colombian President Ivan Duque. \"I don't want to see another one, there's no reason for it.\"\n\nEven as lawmakers haggled over details of their agreement, the White House had been planning behind the scenes to secure the funds for the wall unilaterally.\n\nThe White House says Trump is continuing to weigh his options to fund a border wall, which still include taking executive action to secure funding for a wall. It's not clear which combination of actions the President might use, and the topic has been under debate for weeks.\n\nNot all would require declaring a national emergency, and they are likely to be rolled out piece by piece, not necessarily all at once, once Trump signs off.\n\nIt's not clear which combination of actions the President might use. The estimates for how much each option could garner have also been under debate, and most White House aides believe any executive action will prompt legal challenges -- some will be easy and some more difficult legally, per aides familiar with the matter. The President has held nearly daily meetings with senior advisers and others to discuss his options.\n\nBased on CNN's latest reporting, the President's unilateral options include:\n\nAccessing Treasury forfeiture funds\n\nAn estimated $680 million\n\nWould not require the President to declare a national emergency.\n\nIncludes unobligated funds from participating agencies that can be used to support law enforcement activities.\n\nAfter the Office of Management and Budget reviews the order, Treasury and the Department of Homeland Security would both notify Congress then wait 15 days before the funds can be obligated.\n\nAcquisition of land is allowed under this option.\n\nUsing USC 284 to divert some Pentagon funds for counter-narcotics\n\nUp to an estimated $2 billion\n\nMay not require the President to declare a national emergency, according to a CRS legal report.\n\nDHS must exercise a waiver to transfer counter-drug funds to construct fencing to block drug smuggling.\n\nDHS asks Department of Defense to assist after identifying a location where a fence is needed to block drug smuggling corridor.\n\nUsing USC 2808 to gain access to military construction funds\n\nAn estimated $3.6 billion\n\nWould require the President to declare a national emergency.\n\nWould require the use of the military.\n\nThe President would declare border protection a Defense Department mission.\n\nUse Army Corps civil works funds using USC 2293\n\nAn estimated $3 billion\n\nWould require the President to declare a national emergency, according to a US government official.\n\nThe Secretary of the Army may stop or defer Army civil works projects and apply funds to help build civil defense projects essential for the national defense (Secretary of the Army makes the final determination if essential to national defense).",

    "text": "(CNN) Congressional negotiators say they have reached an agreement in principle to avert a partial government shutdown at the end of this week.\n\nThe four lead bipartisan negotiators, emerging from talks Monday night, declined to get into details on how the agreement was struck or the exact parameters of a deal, but when asked whether it included barrier funding and a resolution to the detention bed issue, Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby said: \"We got an agreement on all of it.\"\n\nShelby's comments follow those from a Democratic aide involved in the border security funding talks who said earlier Monday negotiators are \"very, very close\" to an agreement and they are now checking to see if the emerging proposal would get the votes it needs to pass the House.\n\nLawmakers are racing the clock in an effort to find the common ground necessary for an agreement on border security that will pass both chambers of Congress and be signed into law by the President before Friday at midnight to prevent another partial government shutdown.\n\nAbout 25% of funding for the federal government runs out at the end of the week and a group of bipartisan lawmakers have been meeting for weeks to negotiate over border security as part of the budget for the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nIn a sign that made it look like a shutdown was increasingly likely, talks broke down over the weekend , but four members of that group -- the top Democrat and Republican from both the House and Senate Appropriations committees -- kept meeting Monday to try and broker a deal.\n\nAsked what was different today than over the weekend, Rep. Kay Granger, the top House Republican on the conference committee, quipped, \"Maybe we got sleep.\"\n\n\"That's always sort of helpful in making a decision,\" she added.\n\nThe looming deadline comes on the heels of the longest shutdown in US government history, which began in December and ended in January after President Donald Trump signed legislation to temporarily reopen shuttered parts of the government for a three-week period to allow for border security negotiations.\n\nWhat the President will be willing to accept has remained a wild card hanging over the negotiations. Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill have long signaled that they could reach a deal if left to their own devices, but questions over what the President will accept have continued to inject uncertainty into the process.\n\nSpeaking in El Paso, Texas, on Monday night, Trump said he was made aware of the agreement but didn't listen to the details from advisers.\n\n\"They say that progress is being made. Just so you know. Just now, just now,\" he said. \"I said wait a minute, I gotta take care of my people from Texas. I got to go. I don't even want to hear about it. I don't want to hear about it.\"\n\nBack in Washington, White House officials have mulled one additional idea in recent days, depending on what congressional negotiators came up with: taking the deal that the committee comes to -- depending on what's in it -- but also using other federal funds to build additional barriers.\n\nA White House official says they are keeping their options open right now, including Trump using his executive powers to reallocate federal funds from elsewhere for the wall, but are looking at the agreement now.\n\nAs acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney noted on NBC Sunday, he has been \"combing through the law\" and trying to find additional funds. White House officials believe this is an option even if the President signs the deal to avoid another government shutdown.\n\nJust hours ago they were told the talks were stalled, but that wasn't a huge concern to White House officials, who for days have been continuing discussions about declaring a national emergency.\n\nSen. Patrick Leahy, a top Democratic negotiator, said the goal for the four main participants in the talks was to reach a deal Monday night, then proceed to drafting the final agreement on Tuesday.\n\n\"I think we both agree if we can wrap this up tonight, do it tonight, our goal will be to do it tomorrow,\" said Leahy, of Vermont, regarding his work with Shelby.\n\nAny agreement will need to now hold up in the House and Senate and finally the White House.\n\nThe Democratic aide said there is still \"a ton of work to do once they have an agreement reached\" to ready it for the floor.\n\nA Republican aide involved expressed some caution on the progress given the repeated breakdowns over the past few weeks, but acknowledged negotiators \"are clearly moving in the right direction.\"\n\nAnother GOP aide said, \"Hearing good things tonight.\"\n\nThe most significant sticking point in the shutdown fight so far had been over the President's request of upwards of $5 billion for a border wall. Democrats have made clear that is a non-starter and have refused to meet the President's demand, an impasse that triggered the initial shutdown.\n\nAnother sticking point has also emerged over the issue of detention beds for detained undocumented immigrants . Democrats view detention beds as central to a Trump administration immigration policy that is harsh and needlessly aggressive. Republicans view the detention beds as central to limiting the ability of detained undocumented immigrants from being released into the US as they await hearings.\n\nDemocrats entered negotiations pushing to reduce the number of detention beds funded in the measure to 35,520, while the White House and Republicans sought an increase to 52,000.\n\nThe full details of the tentative agreement struck on Monday evening have yet to be publicly released. But according to a Democratic source, the agreement in principle at this point would include $1.375 billion for physical barriers and a level of 40,520 for overall ICE beds, short of the 52,000 the administration requested and matching current funding levels.\n\nOn a potential cap on ICE detention beds, Trump told the crowd in El Paso, \"I will never sign a bill that forces the mass release of violent criminals into our country. And I will never abolish or in any way mistreat our great heroes from ICE and Border Patrol and law enforcement.\"\n\nRep. David Price, a North Carolina Democrat on the conference committee, said if an agreement was reached on Monday night, both chambers could likely get something to the President's desk before February 15 government funding deadline.\n\n\"I know the goal is to reach it tonight,\" Price said before the announcement of an agreement was made. \"I hope we're back on track now with a serious give and take and good faith negotiations.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments from Monday.",

    "text": "(CNN) President Donald Trump will sign a bill to avert another government shutdown , but also issue a national emergency declaration to build a wall on the US southern border, according to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, replacing lawmakers' most pressing problem with one that strikes at their power to spend money.\n\nFor his first two years in office, Trump enjoyed Republican control of Congress and was still unable to get what he wanted on border security, his signature campaign issue. The likelihood of that dropped even further when Democrats won control of the House of Representatives in the November elections.\n\nTrump's first reaction to that result was to fight Congress, shutting down parts of the government from December 22 until January 25. Now, it appears he'll go around it.\n\nRepublican and Democratic lawmakers reacted to McConnell's announcement with alarm.\n\n\"I think it's a mistake,\" said Sen. Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. \"The National Emergencies Act was contemplated to apply to natural disasters or catastrophic events such as the attacks on our country on 9/11. For the President to use it to re-purpose billions of dollars, that Congress has appropriated for other purposes that has previously signed into law, strikes me as undermining the appropriations process, the will of Congress and being of dubious constitutionality.\"\n\nBefore Thursday, McConnell made clear that he was also concerned of the prospect that the President would declare a national emergency to build a border wall. On January 10, in the middle of what became the longest US government shutdown ever, McConnell told The New York Times magazine , \"I hope he doesn't go down that path.\"\n\nAnd on January 29, during yet another round of negotiations over border security, McConnell told reporters, \"I am for whatever works -- which means avoiding a shutdown, and avoiding the President feeling he should declare a national emergency.\"\n\n\"Exactly how to do that, as you all know, has been quite challenging,\" he added.\n\nBut on Thursday, McConnell said that Trump supported the bill and he had \"indicated\" that he would support the President's national emergency declaration. That announcement paved the way for the Senate to overwhelmingly pass a bill that funds 25% of the federal government, including around $1.375 billion for barriers, which is much lower than Trump's push for $5 billion to fund the border wall. The House is expected to pass it Thursday night, sending it to the President for his signature.\n\nWhen asked by reporters about his latest call with Trump, McConnell said he \"urged\" the President to sign the bill. \"That was my focus,\" he said.\n\nIf the President proceeds with the declaration, it'll likely be challenged in court and by Democrats in Congress, as critics have argued that Trump cannot use the national emergency authority to free up taxpayer funds and build the border wall he has long promised to his political supporters.\n\nEven among members of his own party, support for the President was tepid at best. Veteran Republican senators raised various doubts about using his emergency powers to try to build the wall. Some said they wanted to wait and see exactly what Trump will declare and are skeptical he will do more than use existing executive authority.\n\n\"I do (support that decision) if that's what it takes to do it,\" said Sen. Jim Inhofe, the Republican chairman of the Armed Services committee. \"I just don't want it coming out of defense.\"\n\n\"But what I want doesn't seem to make that much difference,\" he added.\n\nOther rank-and-file Republicans, including Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington and Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota, said they were worried that it would set a new precedent for a Democratic president to set liberal policies without engaging Congress.\n\nIn an interview, Rounds asked, \"What if somebody else thinks that climate change is a national emergency -- then what will they do and how far will they go?\"\n\nSen. John Cornyn of Texas said an emergency declaration is \"not a very practical solution to the problem\" since the funding would get \"tied up\" if there's lawsuit.\n\nAccording to federal law, Congress can rescind a presidential emergency declaration by passing a joint resolution. In the likely event that such a bill would be vetoed by the President, Congress could then override it with a two-thirds majority in the Senate and the House.\n\nIf the House passed it, then the Senate would be required by law to vote on the measure within 18 days, leaving McConnell without a way to stop a vote on the floor.\n\nDemocratic leaders said the President's action would be a threat to the separation of powers. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerry Nadler said he would \"fully support\" a joint resolution to rescind the emergency declaration and intended to \"pursue all other available legal options.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said \"the President's fearmongering\" doesn't make it an emergency.\n\n\"He couldn't convince Mexico, the American people or their elected representatives to pay for his ineffective and expensive wall, so now he's trying an end-run around Congress in a desperate attempt to put taxpayers on the hook for it,\" they said in a statement. \"The Congress will defend our constitutional authorities.\"",

    "text": "Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump appears to be moving -- unhappily -- toward signing a bipartisan agreement that provides only a fraction of the money he demanded for a border wall. But in conversations with allies over the past days, he has griped that Republican negotiators were outplayed by their Democratic counterparts, securing a border funding number far smaller than Trump has spent the last two months demanding.\n\nAs a months-long government funding standoff appears to reach its conclusion, Trump has found his seat at the negotiating table diminished after his tactics failed to yield progress. For a candidate who campaigned as the consummate deal artist, it's an unpleasant reminder that grand bipartisan compromises have so far evaded him.\n\nThe President's own aides have worked behind the scenes to cast the outcome less as a concession and more as an opportunity. Trump himself has been only partly receptive to that characterization.\n\nWhite House aides were still reviewing the legislative text of the bill -- which stacked up to more than 1,000 pages -- on Thursday, looking for any potential \"landmines\" that might cause the President to reject it.\n\n\"Reviewing the funding bill with my team at the @WhiteHouse!\" Trump tweeted midday, after writing (and later deleting) a cryptic message reading only \"funding bill.\"\n\nTrump has signaled to advisers and allies this week he was inclined to sign it to avoid another government shutdown, and would use executive action to attempt securing additional border wall dollars.\n\n\"I know the President is still evaluating the bill the conference committee has produced. I think he's been very clear that he's not happy with it, seeing less than $1.4 billion in border wall funding I know was a disappointment to the President,\" Vice President Mike Pence told reporters on Thursday. Pence, who is attending national security conferences in Warsaw and Munich this week, said he'd spoken to the President regularly about the developments.\n\n\"I think the President's evaluating what's in the bill. He's also evaluating the authority he has and I know he'll be making a decision before the deadline,\" Pence said.\n\nIn public, Trump has remained gracious about the GOP effort.\n\n\"I want to thank all Republicans for the work you have done in dealing with the Radical Left on Border Security,\" he tweeted on Tuesday.\n\nBut privately, Trump has cast the GOP's dealmaking efforts as inadequate and wondered why he, an experienced dealmaker, wasn't consulted at more regular intervals as the two sides haggled over an agreement. The White House acted largely on the sidelines while congressional negotiators struck a deal.\n\nThat was intentional, according to people familiar with the process, who noted Trump's attempts at brokering an agreement between lawmakers proved futile during the record-length government shutdown that ushered in the new year.\n\nThis time, the two sides proceeded without direct involvement from the administration, though did keep Trump's aides updated as the talks progressed.\n\nWhat resulted was an agreement that falls short not only of the President's demands but of earlier efforts to strike a deal. The final dollar figure for the wall is lower than the $1.6 billion included in a December proposal that initially included Republican support but was rejected by the President.\n\nMeanwhile, lawmakers have been left with no public assurance from Trump that he will sign the bill.\n\n\"I pray\" Trump signs the bill, Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby told CNN Thursday. He said he spoke with Trump Wednesday night and the President was in \"good spirits.\" Shelby said he didn't ask directly if Trump would sign it, but indications are that he will.\n\nTo appease the President, aides and some Republican lawmakers have cast the smaller figure, around $1.375 billion, as a down payment that will eventually lead to new wall construction.\n\nInitially, Trump was distressed when he watched Sean Hannity and other Fox News hosts deride the plan, including as he watched recorded versions of prime-time programming during a late-night flight home on Monday from Texas, where he'd held a campaign rally.\n\nTrump spent much of the flight phoning allies to seek counsel and bemoan what he viewed as the lackluster negotiating efforts by Republicans. Hannity, who the President often calls late at night after his show ends, cut away from the rally in El Paso Monday night to dismiss the breakthrough as a \"garbage compromise.\"\n\n\"1.3 billion? That's not a -- not even a wall, a barrier?\" Hannity said. \"Any Republican that supports this garbage compromise, you will have to explain. Look at this crowd. Look at the country. Look at CBS News, even they say 72% of the American people want the heroin to stop, the cartels to stop, the gang members to stop, and those that wish us ill.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Sean Hannity slams 'garbage compromise' deal Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Sean Hannity slams 'garbage compromise' deal 02:21\n\nBut Hannity's tone had changed markedly by the next night.\n\n\"I'm not happy either,\" Hannity said Tuesday. \"Nobody should be happy. The President has every right to be angry.\"\n\nHannity said that while he had \"no insider information,\" he believed the President would declare a national emergency.\n\n\"And the President, I think I know him pretty well, telegraphed that very thing just today,\" Hannity added.\n\nThe difference in those 24 hours were a slew of phone calls from the White House to the President's allies in the media, framing the deal as a win for Trump by making two points: that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was taking a loss because she said the President would not get more than $1 for his wall, while pledging that Trump would take executive action to secure further funding for the wall beyond the $1 billion dollars included in the agreement.\n\nThe President's advisers placed the calls in the hopes Trump's media allies would adopt a more optimistic outlook -- and in turn dissuade the President from rejecting the deal and triggering another government shutdown.\n\nWhite House aides were relieved when the hosts of Fox & Friends cast the deal in a rosier light, followed by the positive remarks from Hannity, Laura Ingraham and Lou Dobbs later on.\n\nOn Thursday, however, some of those voices returned to their initial skepticism.\n\n\"So the president has his hand forced to sign a 1,159 page bill that we KNOW is filled with amnesty, PORK and wiggle room? Total SCAM! @realDonaldTrump wasn't elected for this,\" Ingraham wrote on Twitter. \"This bill must NOT be signed by @realDonaldTrump.\"\n\nWhile Trump has offered signals he will sign the plan, no aide is fully sure he won't reverse course, as he has on previous government funding agreements. Trump has also voiced fresh concern that no one has time to fully read the 1,000-page bill -- something in March he said he wouldn't abide.\n\n\"But I say to Congress: I will never sign another bill like this again. I'm not going to do it again. Nobody read it. It's only hours old,\" he said then, before signing a package he complained contained inadequate border security funding.\n\nThough aides are publicly framing the agreement as a win for the President, many are relieved that he's indicated he will sign it, feeling that they have run out of other options and have no leverage.\n\nOfficials have said they are waiting to read the full text of the bill before the President publicly endorses it, but they were briefed on major aspects of the agreement before a Cabinet meeting Tuesday.",

    "description": "It's the only thing that matters, and yet, Republicans -- even lead negotiators -- have little guarantee that President Donald Trump will sign any border deal they can pull together.",
    "text": "(CNN) It's the only thing that matters, and yet, Republicans -- even lead negotiators -- have little guarantee that President Donald Trump will sign any border deal they can pull together.\n\nThe signs are promising that a 17-person conference committee is making progress . After a private meeting with border officials Wednesday, Republican and Democratic lawmakers alike emerged with that faintest tinge of optimism that had all but evaporated from the Capitol last month during a 35-day shutdown.\n\nAides and members point to progress: Democrats and Republicans are trading proposals back and forth, negotiating in good faith and trying to find a commonsense middle ground that includes a three-pronged approach to border security: a mix of barriers, personnel and technology that both sides can agree on.\n\n\"What we are hearing right now is that they are talking. It's not like some of these negotiations where they all come together 24 hours before a deadline and say 'we've reached an impasse' when in fact they haven't even had any meaningful discussions,\" Republican Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina told CNN. \"I know that they are consulting with (the White House), but I don't know what level of depth they've gotten into.\"\n\nAfter more than two years in office, Trump's Republican colleagues in the House and Senate have resigned themselves to the fact that the President can be impulsive, easily swayed by the counsel of a few rabble-rousing members of the House Freedom Caucus or convinced by an unfavorable review on cable news from an immigration hardliner. It's why even as negotiations progress and appropriators -- known less for ideology than for their pragmatism on Capitol Hill -- remain upbeat about the potential for a deal, lawmakers are always accounting for the fact Trump is a wild card.\n\n\"I believe that if we get to an agreement, there is a good chance he will sign it. Now, will he sign it? I don't know,\" Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby, an Alabama Republican, told CNN.\n\nShelby told CNN he would meet with Trump -- whom he referred to as \"the big man\" -- at the White House Thursday morning to discuss the conference committee.\n\nFollowing the meeting, Shelby was visibly pleased and upbeat when he returned to the Capitol. He told CNN that he and the President did not discuss an overall figure for an emerging agreement but rather the substantive makeup of what they were discussing -- new barriers, new technology and new personnel. He indicated Trump was aware that three-pronged approach is what was being formulated by the conference committee and that he thought Trump was ready to sign an agreement like that and keep the government open.\n\n\"I am pleased,\" Shelby said. \"We had a positive meeting. The President was urging me to try to conclude these negotiations. This is the most positive meeting I've had in a long time. So, we're not there yet, we're seriously negotiating.\"\n\nOne Republican senator who asked to speak on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal GOP thinking, said there's really one big question that worries everyone.\n\n\"I think the question hanging over everybody's head is whatever deal they do -- and I think they do a deal -- will it be acceptable to the President?\" the senator told CNN.\n\nSouth Dakota's John Thune, who as the majority whip is the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, said he'd just prefer not to entertain that hypothetical.\n\n\"I just haven't thought about that scenario,\" said Thune.\n\nThe fear comes after the President blindsided Republicans in December by refusing to sign a stop-gap funding measure to fund the government even after it had sailed through the Senate. In the weeks that followed, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican refused to take up any legislation the President hadn't endorsed. In another test of trust last year, the White House torpedoed a bipartisan immigration deal that some of the President's closest allies on Capitol Hill -- including South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham -- had worked on.\n\nWhile nothing can stop Trump from tweeting, this time congressional negotiators have largely tried to silo themselves off from too much influence from leaders.\n\nThat's not to say that there aren't sticking points: there are still details to be worked on not only how much money will be devoted to border barriers, but also how many detention beds to fund at the border and where to add staffing. Congressional negotiators had hoped to come to an agreement by Friday to allow enough time for the legislative process before the February 15 deadline, but that deadline could slip. Still, there's no denying there's ultimately just one opinion that matters, and that is the President's.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steny Hoyer told reporters Wednesday he hopes the President would sign any agreement reached by the conference committee.\n\n\"Am I sure of that? No. Why? Because he's changed his mind,\" Hoyer said, pointing to the past examples of the President backing away from bipartisan agreements.\n\nLawmakers hope that the bruising shutdown battle would be enough to encourage Trump to sign any proposal they send him.\n\nReminded that hasn't always deterred the President, one Republican member countered \"that was then\" before 800,000 federal workers were furloughed or working without pay, and the President was forced to reopen the government a month later without any money for his border wall.\n\nTrump is still holding onto the option of declaring a national emergency, a step that Republican leaders have warned him could divide their party and force a public rebuke of the President on the Senate floor.\n\nSen. Mitt Romney, a freshman Republican from Utah, said he hoped his party could \"reach a legislative solution\" rather than depend on Trump to take executive action on a border wall.\n\n\"It's been conveyed to him pretty clearly,\" one Republican said requesting anonymity to discuss the ongoing conference discussions. \"The message has been pretty clear that there are lots of issues with Republican senators on this.\"\n\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.",

    "text": "Washington (CNN) Border security talks hit an impasse over the weekend, as Democrats pushed back against another facet of the Trump administration's agenda to crack down on immigration: aggressive detention efforts by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nThe sticking point: Democrats argue that by allowing ICE to up the number of detention beds from 40,520 to 52,000, as the administration wants, the agency will have the capacity to pursue a larger swath of undocumented immigrants, including those without criminal records. They want to go down to 35,520 for the remainder of fiscal year 2019.\n\nBut Republicans view the number of detention beds as central to limiting the ability of detained undocumented immigrants to be released into the US as they await hearings.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is expected to hold a meeting in the Oval Office on Monday afternoon to discuss wall funding as well as a response to Democrats who are demanding a limit on the detention of illegal immigrants. Republican lawmakers are not expected to attend the meeting. Earlier today, Trump aide Stephen Miller led a briefing call along with administration insiders denouncing the Democrats' demands, according to a source close to the White House.\n\nWhat are detention beds?\n\nICE, the Department of Homeland Security's enforcement arm, is tasked with, among other things, detaining and deporting undocumented immigrants residing in the United States. To do so, the agency contracts with county jails and private companies, which operate the facilities where many of the beds are.\n\nBeds are just that -- beds for undocumented immigrants in detention. To that end, the number of beds is representative of how many undocumented immigrants, whether they have criminal convictions or not, can be detained. Costs per bed include the expense of keeping each person in detention, including payments for guards, health care, building maintenance and administrative overhead, ICE says.\n\nNot every detention bed is alike. The cost can vary significantly depending on who is being detained. According to ICE's fiscal year 2018 budget, the daily rate for an adult bed is $133.99. Family beds -- a bed in a family detention center that's suitable for children -- cost around $319 day on average.\n\nIn a call with reporters Monday, acting ICE Deputy Director Matt Albence cast any cap as a threat to security. \"It'll be extremely damaging to the public safety of this country,\" Albence said. \"If we are forced to live within a cap based on interior arrests, we'll immediately be forced to release criminal aliens that are currently sitting in our custody.\"\n\n48,000 in custody\n\nDetention facilities are key to ICE's operations: As of January 1, more than 48,000 individuals were in ICE custody, surpassing the 40,520 beds for which it's received funding. The influx of individuals in ICE custody is in line with Trump's agenda to prioritize enforcement in the interior of the country, not just at the border.\n\nIn fiscal year 2018, for example, ICE held an average of more than 42,000 people in custody. The previous record high since ICE began tracking the data in 2001 was just over 38,000 in 2017.\n\nAccording to the agency, the majority of those arrested by ICE had criminal convictions (many of which are traffic offenses), followed by pending criminal charges, or previously issued final orders of removal.\n\nSome of those booked are also people who had crossed the border illegally. According to ICE statistics , \"book-ins to detention resulting from (Customs and Border Protection) arrests increased by 32%\" in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017.\n\nSome context\n\nTrump has repeatedly criticized the practice of releasing undocumented immigrants as they wait their immigration court hearings, which are oftentimes scheduled years down the line due to a massive backlog. (That backlog increased during the recent partial government shutdown.)\n\nThe White House and Republicans see the addition of detention beds as a way to prevent that. But there are still limitations: Children and families, who now make up the majority of apprehensions, can't be held for more than 20 days as a result of the decades-old settlement agreement Flores v. Reno . (The administration has tried to amend the agreement.)\n\nEven with more detention beds, the administration would be limited in how long it can detain people.\n\nWhere the beds are is the key for Democrats\n\nDemocrats are seeking to cap the number of detention beds at 35,520 for the remainder of fiscal year 2019 and cap the number that can be used to detain individuals who were already in the US at 16,500 in an attempt to return to the level of interior detentions at the end of the Obama administration.\n\n\"A cap on ICE detention beds will force the Trump administration to prioritize deportation for criminals and people who pose real security threats, not law-abiding immigrants who are contributing to our country,\" said Democratic Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard of California, the chair of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee and a member of the House-Senate Conference Committee on Homeland Security.\n\nBut the Trump administration has stood firm on its ask for 52,000 detention beds. During the last shutdown, the White House sent a letter to Congress including the request, citing an uptick in border apprehensions. Nearly 48,000 people were apprehended at the southern border last month, compared with nearly 26,000 in January 2018, according to data from Customs and Border Protection.\n\nThe National Sheriffs' Association and the Major County Sheriffs of America denounced the cap in a letter to House Appropriations Chairwoman Nita Lowey, D-New York, and the committee's top Republican, Kay Granger of Texas. Local law enforcement has a vested interest in ICE's detention capacity, given that the agency works with county jails across the country to detain undocumented immigrants.\n\n\"Any legislation that reduces ICE's detention capacity would hinder its ability to perform its national security and public safety missions, but also impact local law enforcement's ability to protect the communities they serve,\" the letter states. \"In order to meet the cap being tentatively proposed by Congress, ICE would be compelled to release thousands of aliens from custody.\"\n\nWhat's next\n\nThe House and Senate are scheduled to come back on Monday afternoon, but all eyes will be on what, if anything, the 17 conference committee members have to say publicly. The top four members of the House and Senate panels are expected to meet at some point to make a final push toward a deal, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN\n\nHouse Democrats might also move forward with a stopgap funding bill of some sort as a backstop if talks stall.\n\nTrump has a campaign rally in El Paso, Texas, on Monday night.",

    "description": "Donald Trump strode into the House chamber Tuesday night off balance in every way. His dangling red tie was not centered, his left hand fell limp at his side while the right actively pressed the flesh of adoring GOP lawmakers. Even his attempt at a smile look\u2026",
    "text": "Juliana Silva is a strategic communications adviser at Clarity Media Group, a global communications coaching firm based in New York. Bill McGowan is the founder and CEO of Clarity Media Group. He is also the author of \"Pitch Perfect: How to Say It Right the First Time, Every Time.\" Follow him on Twitter @BillMcGowan22 . The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN) Donald Trump strode into the House chamber Tuesday night off balance in every way. His dangling red tie was not centered, his left hand fell limp at his side while the right actively pressed the flesh of adoring GOP lawmakers. Even his attempt at a smile looked crooked and pained.\n\nThe optics were a metaphor for a State of the Union speech that was unbalanced and out of whack, a speech that felt like three different speeches mashed together: one that urged bipartisan cooperation, another that waved a flaming torch in the faces of Democrats, and a third that tried vainly to summon Peggy Noonan-style patriotic poetry in the last five minutes.\n\nPlain and simple, the address was a mess. But even though it's likely to be forgettable, the speech featured a number of optical moments that made a visual impact.\n\nThe first was a moment of suspense that came when Trump turned to encounter new nemesis Nancy Pelosi. Much had been made of what would happen when he came into her House for the first time since she scored her takedown over the partial government shutdown. In handing Madam Speaker a copy of his speech, Trump shook her hand before shaking Vice President Mike Pence's, ensuring he would not be accused of snubbing her.\n\nSitting behind Trump the entire night, nobody could ever accuse Pelosi of being a good poker player. She grimaced, she rolled her eyes, she muttered under her breath every time Trump made a claim not meeting with her approval, especially his assertion that America's strong economy could only be stopped by \"ridiculous partisan investigations.\"\n\nThe optical contrast within the chamber was striking. The GOP side was overwhelmingly white, male and old, clad in dark pinstripes. The Democrats across the aisle were younger, more visibly diverse, and in the case of the newly elected women, noticeably dressed in white . The combination of those women seated directly in front of the President, and Pelosi, also dressed in white, sitting behind him, created the impression of Trump being surrounded by the subpoena-wielding lawmakers who could pose a threat to his presidency -- women whose outfits evoked historical suffragists and female solidarity.\n\nThis was the very same contingent that stole part of the show when Trump acknowledged that 58% of all new jobs were occupied by women. When the congresswomen erupted in wild, self-congratulatory applause and high-fives, Trump seemed startled at the unintended consequences of his remarks, not unlike his surprise over being laughed at by delegates at the United Nations in September.\n\nJUST WATCHED Comics mock Trump's State of the Union address Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Comics mock Trump's State of the Union address 01:16\n\nEven diehard Republican pundits couldn't sugarcoat their appraisal of Trump's oratory skills. Stiff, wooden and painfully halting in his delivery, the President may have taken the \"low energy\" mantle away from Jeb Bush. Teleprompter reading has never been his strong suit, and Tuesday's delivery isn't likely to change that perception. He repeatedly stepped on his own applause lines, such as in committing to eradicate HIV/AIDS in 10 years. When he did get the room to stand and cheer, he strangely stepped back from the podium, looked left (ironically) at the GOP side of the room and shifted into bobblehead mode, nodding incessantly at the approval being showered on him.\n\nThere were several lines that also flopped outright. The section in which he criticized the investigations directed at him, claimed that if not for him, we would already be at war with North Korea and his intent to pull troops out of Syria and Afghanistan landed with a thud.\n\nAnother declaration that didn't exactly bring down the house was what we might call Trump's Gordon Gekko moment. In signaling that he still refuses to give up on building a wall along the southern border, Trump's claim that \"walls work. Walls save lives,\" was eerily reminiscent of Gekko's twisted creed of the 1980s, \"Greed ... is good. ... Greed works.\"\n\nTrump is by no means the only President to deliver a State of the Union having been weakened and damaged politically. Both Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton delivered State of the Union speeches during critical breaking points in their presidencies: Nixon embroiled in Watergate in 1974, Clinton beleaguered by the Monica Lewinsky revelations in 1998.\n\nUnder enormous pressure, Clinton crushed his, a speech widely considered one of the greatest political speeches ever. Nixon, declaring that one year of Watergate investigations was enough, was gone from office less than a year later.\n\nStay up to date... Sign up for our new newsletter. Join us on Twitter and Facebook\n\nPrecisely where on that spectrum of oratory effectiveness Trump's speech falls is still to be determined. But the memorable moments from Trump's second State of the Union will likely not be saved on his own personal highlights reel.",

    "text": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Nick Kwek toured the border dividing the US state of Arizona and Mexico's Sonora\n\nUS congressional talks over a border security deal have stalled, raising the chances of another government shutdown.\n\nNegotiators were hoping for a deal by Monday to give Congress time to pass legislation by Friday, when the federal funding agreement runs out.\n\nThey remain divided on how many undocumented immigrants can be detained and funding for President Trump's promised border wall with Mexico.\n\nThe previous shutdown, lasting 35 days, was the longest in US history.\n\nHundreds of thousands of workers were furloughed while others in essential services, such as hospital care, air traffic control and law enforcement, worked without pay.\n\nThe cost to the US economy was estimated at $11bn (\u00a38.5bn).\n\nIt was unclear how the negotiators would try to reach a deal, but a meeting has been scheduled for later on Monday, congressional aides said.\n\nWhat is the latest impasse about?\n\nThe 17 Republican and Democratic negotiators from the Senate and the House have been holding talks to reach a border security agreement that can be accepted by Congress.\n\nThe latest impasse seems to be centred on a Democratic demand to limit the number of undocumented migrants already in the US who can be detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\nDemocrats planned to cap the number of beds at detention centres reserved for those cases at 16,500.\n\nBy doing that, they hoped to force ICE to focus on detaining irregular migrants with criminal records instead of those who have overstayed their visas and, Democrats say, are productive and offer no threat.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Other presidents got money for a border barrier - why not Trump?\n\nThey were also looking at between $1.3bn and $2bn in funding for Mr Trump's proposed border wall, a long way off the $5.7bn the president has been demanding.\n\nIn a series of tweets on Monday, President Trump said that Democrats needed to \"loosen up\", adding that their latest demand relating to the detention of migrants was \"crazy\".\n\nThe president had earlier said the Democrats were \"behaving, all of a sudden, irrationally\".\n\nLead Republican negotiator Sen Richard Shelby told Fox News: \"I'll say 50-50 we get a deal... The spectre of a shutdown is always out there.\"\n\nHowever, one of the Democratic negotiators, Jon Tester, said there was still hope that a deal could be reached in time. Also speaking to Fox News, he said: \"Negotiations seldom go smooth all the way through.\"\n\nAs wall discussions labour on, Mr Trump plans on sending over 3,700 active troops to the US-Mexico border to help agents with security efforts this month. With over 2,000 troops already at the border, the new deployment would top November's election-time numbers of 5,900.\n\nMeanwhile, pushing back against the Trump administration's call for border states to help with security, California's Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom says he will recall hundreds of the state's national guard from the border.\n\nGov Newsom's move follows his Democratic colleague, Gov Michelle Grisham of New Mexico, who pulled her state's troops from the border last week.\n\nBoth governors have cited the withdrawal as a retaliation against Mr Trump's \"fear-mongering\".\n\nWhy is there a risk of another shutdown?\n\nOn 25 January, President Trump agreed to a three-week spending deal to end the shutdown and allow Congress to reach an agreement.\n\nThat funding ends at midnight on Friday. Another short-term deal could prevent a new shutdown, according to the New York Times.\n\nMr Trump - who has suggested the talks are a \"waste of time\" - made building a wall on the border with Mexico one of his key promises in the 2016 campaign.\n\nThe president has backed away from his calls to make Mexico pay for a concrete wall but during his State of the Union speech last Tuesday - delayed because of the previous shutdown - he insisted on a \"smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier\".\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Just why has the US government partially shut down?\n\nHe has previously threatened to declare a national emergency and fund the wall without Congress. But this idea is disliked even by some fellow Republicans and Democrats are likely to challenge it in courts.\n\nMr Trump said on Saturday the wall would \"get built one way or the other!\" He is set to hold a rally in the border city of El Paso, in Texas, later on Monday to gather support for his wall.\n\nAhead of his visit, local officials denounced the president's remarks that a fence built there more than a decade ago reduced criminality.\n\nWhat would happen in a shutdown?\n\nFederal agencies including the departments of Homeland Security, State, Agriculture and Commerce could lose access to money and begin to close down again, affecting about 800,000 federal employees, who would go unpaid.\n\nDuring a shutdown, essential services continue to operate, with workers being required to show up.

    "title": "NASA \u201cstill working toward\u201d 2020 launch of massive SLS rocket",
    "description": "Multiple concerns remain: cost, schedule, management, delayed upper stage.",
    "text": "NASA has continued to make progress with the development of its large Space Launch System (SLS) rocket as work continued on its critical core stage throughout the partial government shutdown, and the agency is nearing critical hardware tests. However, it now seems all but certain that NASA will miss its latest launch date for the first flight of the rocket, June 2020.\n\nMultiple sources have told Ars that while NASA is still targeting sometime later in 2020 for a test launch of the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft, known as Exploration Mission-1, this flight is likely to slip into 2021.\n\nThis week, in response to a query about potential delays, a spokeswoman for the agency's exploration program, Kathryn Hambleton, said the agency is not ready to discuss a new schedule yet. \"NASA is still assessing impacts as a result of the shutdown, but we are still working toward a launch in 2020,\" she told Ars.\n\nHardware moving\n\nThe core stage of the rocket, consisting of a large, liquid hydrogen fuel tank, a smaller but still considerable liquid oxygen tank, and four main engines, is coming together. In January, the agency installed the large liquid hydrogen tank onto a test stand at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama for a \"structural test.\" This tank, identical to one that will be used during a mission, will be subjected to the same stresses and loads it will endure during liftoff and flight.\n\nFollowing this step, the agency will perform a similar structural test of the liquid oxygen fuel tank before what is known as a \"green run\" test. For this exercise, NASA will assemble the two large tanks and then integrate them with the rocket's four main RS-25 engines. Then, at a test stand in southern Mississippi, the rocket will fire its engines through a standard launch of the rocket.\n\nNASA/Steven Seipel\n\nNASA\n\nNASA\n\nNASA\n\nNASA\n\nNASA\n\nNASA has yet to formally set a date for this \"green run\" test, but whenever it does occur will be a key indicator for when we will see the first actual launch of the SLS rocket. If the green run test is conducted late in 2019, there would still be a chance for a 2020 launch. However, the agency and its prime contractor for the core stage, Boeing, are on a tight timeline that has little margin for technical problems that might occur during the structural tests of the tank or the green run tests. Historically, during this integration and test process with other large rocket programs, major problems have often occurred.\n\nIt is not clear how deeply the shutdown affected the SLS timeline, even though core stage work did proceed. \"The shutdown impacted at least day for day,\" one source said of the schedule. \"But I am sure it was more than that.\"\n\nNASA originally planned to launch the SLS rocket on its maiden flight in November 2017, so the rocket will now be at least three years later than originally anticipated. The program's budget is more than $2 billion a year, so these delays have cost the agency considerably.\n\nUpper stage concerns\n\nThis week, NASA also confirmed that it has ordered three Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stages from United Launch Alliance. Originally, NASA had planned to use this placeholder upper stage for its SLS rocket for a single flight. But now it will almost certainly use the ICPS stage for at least three flights, if not several more. This raises questions about the viability of the agency's plan to have Boeing build a more powerful second stage, known as the Exploration Upper Stage.\n\nHambleton told Ars, \"NASA has placed orders for three ICPS\u2019 to use on SLS Block 1 for the first three flights, which currently include the first test flight of SLS and Orion (Exploration Mission-1), the first crewed flight (Exploration Mission-2), and the Europa Clipper mission.\"\n\nThere is some flexibility to this, however. As Ars has previously reported, NASA is seriously considering using the Falcon Heavy rocket with a Star 48 kick stage for the Europa Clipper mission. That could push the agency toward using the ICPS for a third exploration mission, which presently is scheduled to begin construction of a Lunar Gateway near the Moon.\n\nMeanwhile, work by Boeing and NASA on the Exploration Upper Stage has slowed. This is partly because the agency is looking at alternative designs to bring Boeing's projected cost of the stage down. Ars has also learned that NASA is looking at potential scenarios in which it constructs the Gateway with the initial Block 1 configuration of the SLS rocket with the ICPS upper stage because the more powerful upper stage will not be ready in time.\n\nPublicly, at least, NASA has not changed its posture on the more powerful upper stage. In an interview late in 2018, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine acknowledged that the agency is focused on core stage development now rather than the Exploration Upper Stage. \"We have closer alligators to the canoe right now, and that would include the core stage.\" But he said NASA remains committed to the Exploration Upper Stage, calling it a \"critical component.\"\n\nPriorities\n\nIn his State of the Union speech on Tuesday night, President Trump mentioned the forthcoming 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 Moon landings, and he also gave a nod to the commercial crew program, which may launch humans from Florida late this year. However, Trump did not mention his own return-to-the-Moon plans or the rocket NASA says it needs to carry this out.\n\n\"It is somewhat surprising that Trump did not use the occasion tonight to point to his own initiative with at least a phrase if not an entire sentence,\" Marcia Smith noted on her website, Space Policy Online. \"The omission may portend a constrained FY2020 budget request for NASA\u2019s human spaceflight program.\" An outline of the president's budget is expected March 11.\n\nHowever, if NASA is to bring the SLS to the launch pad in late 2020, it will probably need more money for the program, not less. A report by NASA's inspector general critical of Boeing's management of the SLS project, published last October, warned of a funding crunch. The report found that NASA would probably need an additional $1 billion on top of its existing funds to complete the rocket by next year.",

    "description": "\"The workload is large, but I believe we can handle it.\"",
    "text": "Welcome to Edition 1.35 of the Rocket Report! The leader of Russia's space program, Dmitry Rogozin, has promised his president that the country can double its launch total this year. And if you believe that, well, we've got a trampoline to sell you that will allow your astronauts to reach orbit.\n\nAs always, we welcome reader submissions, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.\n\nABL scales up vehicle performance. ABL Space Systems said that it will offer a more powerful variant of its RS1 rocket\u2014up from 900 to 1,200kg to LEO\u2014to find its niche in the crowded smallsat-launcher market. A launch will cost $12 million. Company executives told SpaceNews that the increase in performance comes after a year and a half of work to refine the design of the vehicle and better understand what it would take to produce the rocket.\n\nSomething of a trend? ... Other industry executives have come to similar conclusions of late. Whereas Rocket Lab and a handful of other providers have gone really small with their rockets, there seems to be an additional sweet spot in the market in the range of about one ton of lift capacity. With Firefly and Relativity Space also targeting this market segment, this appears to represent a new lane in the smallsat-launcher race. (submitted by Ken the Bin)\n\nSecond Iranian space launch fails. For the second time in the last month, an Iranian space launch appears to have failed. The two-stage, liquid-fueled rocket based on missile technology the Iranians obtained from the North Koreans, named Safir, attempted to place a satellite called Dousti into space this week. Iran says that it wants to put satellites into space, not develop ICBM technology. US officials are not convinced of this.\n\nSatellite imagery helps ... The imagery suggests that the rocket flew for a while before failing. \"The scorch marks and lack of apparent crash adjacent to the pad suggest it made it at least 10 seconds, if not longer into flight,\" Michael Elleman, a physicist and senior fellow for missile defense at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, told NPR. \"Whether the first or second stage failed, we cannot judge without additional information.\"\n\nSign up for the Rocket Report First Name Last Name Email Leave this field empty if you're human:\n\nArianeGroup to partner with UK launch site. ArianeGroup will work the Shetland Space Centre in defining a \"concept of operations and assessing the range of missions\" for the spaceport project in a three-month study, the Shetland News reports. \"We are flattered that yet another major industry player supports Shetland and Unst in particular as the optimal location to promote small-satellite launch and support activity within the UK and Europe,\" the space center's CEO, Frank Strang, said.\n\nAspires to launch smallsats ... At 60 degrees north latitude, Shetland is the United Kingdom's most-northerly island. ArianeGroup oversees the development of the Ariane and Vega rockets. An ArianeGroup official said the company is \"bringing our space infrastructure expertise\" to the venture, which aspires to launch small satellites. As with all spaceports, we'll remain somewhat skeptical until there's an anchor tenant with a viable launch vehicle.\n\nSpaceflight signs LSA with Vector. Spaceflight announced Wednesday that it has signed a Launch Services Agreement with Vector for a 2019 launch, with multiple price options for future launches, on the Vector-R launch vehicle. Spaceflight will integrate smaller payloads for launch on the rocket as part of its rideshare services.\n\nGoing small ... \"This unique LSA demonstrates our belief in Vector's potential and commitment to providing customers the most variety in launch vehicle access,\" Melissa Wuerl, VP of business development at Spaceflight, said in a news release. This is an interesting agreement, because it means even the smaller end of rocket-launch providers is looking at putting together rideshare deals, which in this case may mean 10 to 20 CubeSats. It's worth noting, as well, that rocket companies view rideshares as both an opportunity and a threat. (submitted by Ken the Bin)\n\nVector now targeting late summer for orbital launch. Last year came and went without Vector delivering on a promise for an orbital rocket launch, and now the company has a new schedule. A suborbital launch of the Block 1 version of Vector-R is scheduled for May, followed by an orbital launch in August, SpaceNews reports.\n\nShutdown blamed? ... The schedule has slipped \"because of the facts that we find on the ground plus the government shutdown,\" Vector CEO Jim Cantrell said. Certainly the shutdown may have played a small role, but it can't account for the lion's share of an eight-month delay. Four orbital launches are planned for 2019, Cantrell said, and those launches have been sold. We hope they happen.\n\nHawaiian spaceport faces more opposition. A proposal to build a smallsat launch site on the Big Island is being met with concern by residents, Hawaii News Now reports. The Alaska Aerospace Corporation wants to build Pacific Spaceport Complex-Hawaii in Keaau. Critics have many concerns, including noise and possible air and water pollution.\n\nNo rockets, please ... \"We want to tell them 'no rockets.' This is just uncalled for. I lived my whole entire life with my families in our Hawaiian Homes community with toxic facilities that have very little checks and balances,\" said Terri Napeahi, an organizer with Keaukaha Action Network. There are already widespread concerns in Hawaii about the ongoing development of Mauna Kea as a facility for telescopes, especially with the proposed Thirty Meter Telescope, so further opposition to a rocket launch site is to be expected.\n\nRogozin promises to launch 45 rockets this year. In a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Roscosmos chief Dmitry Rogozin said the country will more than double its 2018 output. \"I must note that, in 2018, we had 22 launches; in 2019, Mr. President, 45 launches are planned\u2014more than double,\" he said, according to Parabolic Arc. \"The workload is large, but I believe we can handle it.\"\n\nGood luck with that ... Let's see, it's February 6 and Russia has launched <checks notes> zero rockets this year. The first mission is planned for NET February 21. To say we have no confidence in this prediction would be overstating it. This is more hollow bluster from Rogozin, and frankly we wonder how long Putin is going to swallow it. We'll be impressed if Russia matches its launch total from 2018. (submitted by BH and Ken the Bin)\n\nFalcon 9 to launch private lunar lander. SpaceIL's Beresheet lander is about the size and shape of a family dinner table, roughly six feet in diameter and four feet high, weighing (on Earth) about 350 pounds. This doesn't include the nearly 1,000 pounds of fuel it carries, The Conversation reports. It is scheduled to launch as a rideshare passenger on a Falcon 9 rocket later this month.\n\nGo XPrize! ... SpaceIL is one of the holdovers from the Google Lunar XPrize competition that ended without a winner. But the company has pressed ahead, and it will now attempt to soft land its spacecraft on the Moon and communicate with it. This would be an important first step toward the much-discussed commercialization of the Moon, but the lander is expected to survive for only a few days on the lunar surface. (submitted by fleisher)\n\nNASA selects ULA for asteroid-mission launch. NASA chose United Launch Alliance's Atlas V vehicle to launch the Lucy mission, which will be the first spacecraft to visit Jupiter's swarm of Trojan asteroids. \"This mission has a once-in-a-lifetime planetary launch window, and Atlas V's world-leading schedule certainty, coupled with our reliability and performance, provided the optimal vehicle for this mission,\" ULA chief Tory Bruno said in a news release.\n\nLaunch in just a few years ... The Lucy mission is scheduled to launch in October 2021 from Space Launch Complex-41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. Without knowing the proprietary bid details or whether SpaceX competed for the mission, it is impossible to say why ULA won the launch. While price certainly matters, there is no question that ULA has delivered over and over again for NASA. So that may indeed explain the company's contract win here. (submitted by Ken the Bin)\n\nCommercial crew flights slip again. In an announcement that surprised almost no one, NASA acknowledged that its commercial crew demonstration missions would slip a bit later into 2019. NASA said that the initial uncrewed test flight by SpaceX's Crew Dragon spacecraft, previously scheduled for no earlier than February 23, was now scheduled for March 2. A second test flight, with NASA astronauts Bob Behnken and Doug Hurley, is now scheduled for July, SpaceNews reports.\n\nNeeds extra time ... Boeing's first uncrewed test flight of its CST-100 Starliner vehicle, previously scheduled for March, is now expected no earlier than April. A crewed test flight, with NASA astronauts Mike Fincke and Nicole Mann, and Boeing astronaut Chris Ferguson, is scheduled for no earlier than August. We don't have confidence on most of these estimates, but it is interesting that SpaceX's dates lack the \"no earlier than\" notation that accompanies Boeing's estimates. Perhaps that means SpaceX's projected launch dates are a bit more grounded in reality. Or not. (submitted by Unrulycow and Ken the Bin)\n\nFrench auditor raises concerns about Ariane 6. France's independent state auditor, the Cour des comptes, has raised concerns about the viability of Europe's new rocket, the Ariane 6 launcher, Ars reports. \"This new launcher does not constitute a sustainable response in order to be competitive in a commercial market in stagnation,\" the auditor's report states. The Ariane 6 rocket design is too \"cautious,\" according to the report, relying on mostly traditional technologies. SpaceX is praised for its move toward reusable launch vehicles.\n\nMay not change much ... Overall, this is a critical report, but it seems unlikely to effect much of a change. Previously, European leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron, have stated that they want the continent to maintain its own independent access to space. So the Ariane 6 is likely to fly for a long time, whether it is commercially viable on its own or, as this report suggests may happen, requires subsidies to break even. (submitted by paulfjeld)\n\nSpaceX test fires its Raptor engine. The rocket company successfully test fired its Mars rocket engine at 65 percent for two seconds, Ars reports. Founder Elon Musk said the test was successful, although some greenish hues in the flame indicated that some of the copper lining on the engine had burned off. The SpaceX team worked through Super Bowl weekend to make the test happen, another indication of how urgent the company's development of its next-generation rocket and spacecraft has become. It performed an additional test firing on Wednesday.\n\nA critical engine ... Musk and SpaceX have a lot riding on this engine, as it will power both the Super Heavy rocket during launch and the Starship spacecraft in space. Engineers can do plenty of analysis on a rocket motor prior to putting it on a test stand, but there is no substitute for lighting the candle and seeing what happens. Nothing blew up, so this is a good first step.\n\nSLS launch may slip into 2021. Although NASA has continued to make progress with the development of its large Space Launch System, it now seems all but certain that NASA will miss its latest launch date for the first flight of the rocket, June 2020. Multiple sources told Ars that, while NASA is still targeting sometime later in 2020 for a test launch of the SLS rocket and Orion spacecraft (known as Exploration Mission-1), this flight is likely to slip into 2021.\n\nNo word on a new schedule ... \"NASA is still assessing impacts as a result of the shutdown, but we are still working toward a launch in 2020,\" an agency spokeswoman said to Ars. In reality, we're hearing from engineers and suppliers that internal schedules have almost entirely ruled out the possibility of a launch in 2020 and that more delays would almost certainly happen if problems occur during the critical tank and green run tests.\n\nNext three launches\n\nFeb. 19: Falcon 9 | PSN 6/SpaceIL Lunar Lander | Cape Canaveral, Florida | 01:58 UTC\n\nFeb. 21: Soyuz | EgyptSat-A | Baikonur, Kazakhstan | 16:47 UTC\n\nFeb. 22: Soyuz | OneWeb pilot program | Kourou, French Guiana | 21:37 UTC",

    "description": "The top four Democratic and Republican negotiators in the U.S. Congress on border security funding were scheduled to meet later on Monday in an attempt to reach a deal that would avert another government shutdown by a Friday deadline.",
    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. congressional negotiators on Monday reached a tentative deal to try to avert another partial government shutdown on Saturday, but congressional aides said it did not contain the $5.7 billion President Donald Trump wants for a border wall.\n\n\u201cWe reached an agreement in principle\u201d on funding border security programs through Sept. 30, Republican Senator Richard Shelby told reporters.\n\n\u201cOur staffs are going to be working feverishly to put all the particulars together,\u201d Shelby said. Neither he nor three other senior lawmakers flanking him provided any details of the tentative pact.\n\nBut it was far from clear if the Republican president would embrace the agreement. His December demand for $5.7 billion this year to help pay for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border - rejected by congressional Democrats - triggered a 35-day partial government shutdown that ended last month without him getting wall funding.\n\nA congressional aide, who asked not to be identified, said the outline of the deal included $1.37 billion for erecting new fencing along the southern border. That is about the same amount Congress allocated last year and far below what Trump has demanded.\n\nThe aide said none of the money would be for a \u201cwall,\u201d which Trump has been touting since he launched his campaign for president in 2016. Democrats say the wall would be costly and ineffective.\n\nTwo other congressional sources said only currently deployed designs could be used for constructing 55 miles (90 km) of additional barriers. Those designs, which include \u201csteel bollard\u201d fencing, have been in use since before Trump became president.\n\nShortly after the deal was reached in the U.S. Capitol, Trump held a rally in the border city of El Paso, Texas, to argue for the wall he says can protect Americans from violent criminals, drugs and a \u201ctremendous onslaught\u201d of migrant caravans.\n\nTrump said he heard about progress in the talks just before he took the stage, but he too did not discuss details. \u201cJust so you know - we\u2019re building the wall anyway,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe progress has been made - maybe not.\u201d\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke, the former Democratic congressman from Texas considering a 2020 White House run, held a counter-rally just 200 yards away and accused Trump of stoking \u201cfalse fear\u201d about immigrants and telling \u201clies\u201d about O\u2019Rourke\u2019s hometown of El Paso.\n\nThe U.S. and Mexico border fence is seen in Tijuana, Mexico, January 27, 2019. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton\n\nBut a vocal group of conservatives influential with Trump has urged him to remain steadfast in his demand for the border wall money. In comments about the tentative congressional deal reached on Monday, Fox News commentator Sean Hannity told his viewers: \u201cAny Republican that supports this garbage compromise, you will have to explain.\u201d\n\nDETENTION BEDS\n\nUnder Monday\u2019s agreement, which must be fleshed out by congressional staff experts, Democrats gave up on a demand they floated on Friday night to lower the cap on immigrant detention beds in the interior of the United States.\n\nDemocrats had complained the Trump administration was increasing detention capacity as a way of speeding up deportations of illegal immigrants, some of whom were seeking asylum under U.S. law.\n\nBut an overall cap - on borders and in the interior - would remain at 40,520 beds. The aide said that despite that cap, the number had actually grown to 49,057 and that under the deal, it would be brought down to the legal cap.\n\nBut one of the other aides said the deal would give Trump the flexibility to increase the number to 52,000 if necessary.\n\nDemocratic Representative Nita Lowey said on Monday night: \u201cI hope by Wednesday we\u2019ll have a finished product.\u201d Lowey said she had been in touch with House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who she said \u201chas confidence I have made the right decision.\u201d\n\nTrump agreed to reopen the government last month for three weeks to allow congressional negotiators time to find a compromise on government funding for the rest of the fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30, to avert another shutdown.\n\nThe handful of lawmakers leading the negotiations met privately for about two hours on Monday.

    "title": "U.S. Congress advances border security bill without Trump border wall",
    "description": "The U.S. Congress on Thursday aimed to end a dispute over border security with legislation that would ignore President Donald Trump's request for $5.7 billion (\u00a34.45 billion) to help build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border but avoid a partial government shutdo\u2026",
    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump vowed on Thursday to declare a national emergency in an attempt to fund his U.S.-Mexico border wall without congressional approval, a step likely to plunge him into a battle with Congress over constitutional powers.\n\nConceding defeat in his earlier demand that Congress provide him with $5.7 billion in wall money, Trump agreed to sign a government-funding bill that lacks money for his wall, but prevents another damaging government shutdown.\n\nThe bill, passed overwhelmingly by both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives on Thursday, contains money for fencing and other forms of border security. But it ignores the wall, which Trump in his 2016 campaign promised Mexico would pay for, arguing it is needed to check illegal immigration and drugs.\n\nThe bill was expected to go to the White House on Friday for the president\u2019s signature before he flies to his private Mar-a-Lago golf club in Florida for a holiday weekend break.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump will sign the government funding bill, and as he has stated before, he will also take other executive action - including a national emergency,\u201d White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said.\n\nThe top Democrat in Congress denounced the president\u2019s move. Asked by reporters if she would file a legal challenge to an emergency declaration, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said: \u201cI may, that\u2019s an option.\u201d\n\nTop Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer accused Trump of a \u201cgross abuse of the power of the presidency.\u201d\n\nRepublican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would support Trump on the emergency. Earlier this month, McConnell had cautioned Trump that declaring an emergency could divide Senate Republicans, the Washington Post reported.\n\nAn emergency declaration could infringe on Congress\u2019 authority to make major decisions about taxpayer funds, a fundamental check and balance spelled out in the Constitution.\n\nFor weeks, as the president\u2019s wall-funding demand to Congress went nowhere, even after a historic 35-day partial government shutdown, the White House explored whether an emergency declaration could be invoked to redirect taxpayer funds committed by Congress for other purposes toward the wall.\n\n\u2018A MISTAKE\u2019\n\nThe national emergency strategy, expected to be declared by Trump on Friday, was already dividing Republicans.\n\nSenator Susan Collins, a Republican moderate, said in a statement: \u201cDeclaring a national emergency for this purpose would be a mistake on the part of the president.\u201d\n\nBut Representative Mark Meadows, chairman of a right-wing Republican faction in the House, said: \u201cAt this point, President Trump must look at taking executive action - and I will stand with him to protect our sovereign borders.\u201d\n\nFILE PHOTO: U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a campaign rally at El Paso County Coliseum in El Paso, Texas, U.S., February 11, 2019. REUTERS/Leah Millis\n\nCongressional aides said House Democrats would take various steps to try to block Trump\u2019s emergency, possibly including a lawsuit. The short-term result of that could be a court injunction blocking any diversion of funds while judges weigh the matter, possibly leading to a Supreme Court decision.\n\nA senior White House official said the administration had found nearly $7 billion to reallocate to the wall, including $600 million from a Treasury Department forfeiture fund, $2.5 billion from a Defense Department drug interdiction fund and $3.5 billion from a military construction budget.\n\nThe funds would cover just part of the estimated $23 billion cost of the wall promised by Trump along the 2,000-mile (3,200-km) border with Mexico.\n\nA source said lawyers from the White House and other agencies had vetted the figures and believed they would withstand a legal challenge.\n\nCONGRESSIONAL PASSAGE\n\nThe Republican-led Senate passed the government funding bill by a vote of 83-16 and the Democratic-led House by a vote of 300-128, with 86 House Republicans voting in favor. The measure would provide more than $300 billion to fund the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies through Sept. 30, the end of the current fiscal year.\n\nIt also includes $1.37 billion in new money to help build 55 miles (88.5 km) of new physical border barriers. That is the same level of funding Congress appropriated for border security measures last year, including barriers, but not concrete walls.\n\nFunding for those agencies was due to expire on Friday, which would trigger another partial federal shutdown on Saturday morning if Trump unexpectedly refuses to sign the bill.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell listens to U.S. President Donald Trump as the President holds a meeting with Republican House and Senate leadership in the Roosevelt Room at the White House in Washington, D.C., U.S. Sept. 5, 2018. REUTERS/Leah Millis\n\nSome of Trump\u2019s fellow Republicans have warned him that declaring a national emergency could set a dangerous precedent, opening the door for a future Democratic president to circumvent Congress and declare emergencies on perhaps climate change, gun control or healthcare insurance.\n\nPelosi said: \u201cIf the president can declare an emergency on something that he has created as an emergency - an illusion that he wants to convey - just think of what a president with different values can present to the American people.\u201d\n\nDemocratic Senator Ron Wyden said: \u201cI will pull out all the stops to stop this horrendous, bizarre idea. As people get a chance to sort through what the implications really are, we will have strong bipartisan support for opposing this. ... We are the appropriators, not the president.\u201d",

REUTERS/Mary F. Calvert\n\nA group of 17 Republican and Democratic members of the Senate and House of Representatives are trying to beat a Feb. 15 deadline for passing legislation to fund U.S. border security operations over the next eight months.\n\nTrump is insisting on $5.7 billion to build a wall - a demand that led to the recent 35-day partial federal government shutdown that ended last month. Leading Democrats have said there will be no money for a wall, despite the president\u2019s declaration during his State of the Union address on Tuesday that \u201cI will get it built.\u201d\n\nOne of the 17 negotiators, Democratic Senator Dick Durbin, left the briefing by Customs and Border Protection agents telling reporters that lawmakers demanded a list of priorities for securing the U.S.-Mexico border from illegal drugs and undocumented immigrants.\n\n\u201cWhat they said over again was technology,\u201d Durbin said. \u201cThey don\u2019t rule out barriers, they don\u2019t rule out fences. But that isn\u2019t the first priority.\u201d\n\nOther members backed up Durbin\u2019s assessment of the border officials\u2019 position.\n\n\u201cTechnology\u201d refers to devices such as huge scanners that can look inside trucks and cars, sensors, drones and other high-tech tools that could be quickly dispatched.\n\nSenator Richard Shelby, a senior Republican negotiator, told reporters that the administration\u2019s border security experts advised providing money for a mix of additional law enforcement agents, physical barriers and high-tech devices.\n\nShelby also said the lawmakers were briefed on \u201cterrorists\u201d who were coming across the southern border. While he said they were originating in the Middle East, he did not provide figures on the number of people detected and did not know whether they were apprehended.\n\nFor Congress to be able to pass legislation funding the Department of Homeland Security and a range of other federal agencies by a self-imposed Feb. 15 deadline, the negotiators aimed to strike a deal and write a bill by this Friday or Saturday.\n\nFailure could result in another partial government closure, following the shutdown that began last Dec. 22, when Trump refused to sign a funding bill that did not contain the money he wanted for wall construction to fulfill an often-repeated campaign promise. The shutdown, which Trump initially said he would take responsibility for before shifting blame to Democrats, idled some 800,000 government employees.\n\nLawmakers noted there is the possibility of passing another short-term funding bill to give more time to negotiate border security.\n\nWhile Trump repeatedly has described illegal immigration as \u201can urgent national crisis,\u201d Durbin said the focus at Wednesday\u2019s briefing was on \u201cthe most serious drug epidemic in the history of the United States of America\u201d with undetected opioids coming mainly through U.S. ports of entry.\n\nLate on Tuesday, Democratic Representative Pete Aguilar, another border security negotiator, told Reuters in a telephone interview that a \u201crange of options\u201d were being weighed.\n\nHe said there was nothing in Trump\u2019s State of the Union speech, which focused on building a wall, that he thought would help the negotiators.\n\n\u201cBut our job is to tune out all the noise and to try to get to a compromise,\u201d Aguilar said.",

REUTERS/Jose Luis Gonzalez/File Photo\n\nThe group of states, including California and New York, has charged the president and top officials in his administration with taking away taxpayer funds for their communities to fulfill a promise from his 2016 campaign to curb illegal immigration and the flow of drugs.\n\nTrump\u2019s remarks to reporters in the Oval Office suggested he was not concerned or surprised by the states\u2019 legal challenge.\n\n\u201cI think, in the end, we\u2019re going to be very successful with the lawsuit,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s an open-and-closed case.\u201d\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union on Tuesday filed its own lawsuit in a U.S. District Court in California, alleging that \u201cTrump disregarded the will of Congress with his emergency declaration.\u201d\n\nLegal experts have said challenges to Trump\u2019s emergency declaration, which critics have called unconstitutional, face an uphill and probably losing battle in a showdown likely to be decided by the conservative-majority U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nTrump declared the national emergency under a 1976 law after Congress declined to give him the $5.7 billion he wanted to build parts of the barrier this year.\n\nThe president\u2019s demand for wall funding triggered a historic 35-day government shutdown that ended in January. Democrats and Republicans later agreed on a deal to avoid another shutdown with $1.4 billion allocated toward border fencing. Trump agreed to sign that and then declared a national emergency, redirecting an additional $6.7 billion beyond what lawmakers authorized for the project.\n\nCalifornia, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Virginia and Michigan joined forces for the lawsuit.\n\nThe states said Trump\u2019s order would cause them to lose millions of dollars in federal funding for National Guard units dealing with counter-drug activities and that redirection of funds from authorized military construction projects would damage their economies.\n\nTexas landowners and an environmental group also filed suit against the move.\n\nTrump predicted the legal challenges when he made the announcement in the White House Rose Garden last week, and he defended his right to make the declaration on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe need strong borders. We have to stop drugs and crime and criminals and human trafficking. And we have to stop all of those things that a strong wall will stop,\u201d he said.\n\nHouse of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the country\u2019s top Democrat, has called a wall immoral. The issue is likely to be a flashpoint in the 2020 presidential campaign, just as it was when Trump, a Republican, ran for president in 2016.\n\nThe ACLU suit, filed on behalf of the Sierra Club and the Southern Border Communities Coalition, said that in addition to diverting taxpayer money from other federal projects, Trump\u2019s barrier would affect \u201cecologically sensitive habitats\u201d and disturb wilderness areas along the border.",

This notion the Fed has been probably trying to shift itself away from trying to rearm itself with ammunition to fight the next downturn, that was really the one big change in Fed strategy which is now obviously embraced by investors.\u201d\n\nKEITH LERNER, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST, SUNTRUST ADVISORY SERVICES, ATLANTA\n\n\u201cThe big takeaway is he\u2019s reaffirming the patient approach. The Fed is not rushing to increase rates here. The U.S. economy seems fine, though they did see some weakness specifically on the global economy. They\u2019re watching the financial markets.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe way the market received the message last time is consistent with his current view. There has been volatility around his past testimony, and this gave him another time to restate his message.\u201d\n\nJON HILL, INTEREST RATE STRATEGIST, BMO CAPITAL MARKETS, NEW YORK (via email)\n\n\u201cAs Powell\u2019s testimony gets underway, his comments at first glance appear to reiterate the characterization of the economy that he presented following the January FOMC. This makes intuitive sense, given ongoing mixed signals from the economic data and persistent downside risks globally, but largely does not represent new information for the market. The description of the economy as solid but slowing is consistent with short rates approaching, if not at, neutral. That being said, any Q&A certainly could still spark price action as 5s/30s has steepened to a 12-month high.\u201d\n\nERIK NELSON, CURRENCY STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO SECURITIES, NEW YORK:\n\n\u201cI am not seeing a lot of new in Powell\u2019s comments. They were pretty much as advertised and pretty much what we saw back in January and we\u2019re seeing limited reaction in the FX market, which is I think consistent with that. Powell wasn\u2019t more dovish than what we saw in January, but he\u2019s certainly less hawkish than he was last year. The thing is, the market has already priced in this seismic shift from the Fed toward a more neutral or more data-dependent stance.\u201d\n\nCHRIS ZACCARELLI, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, INDEPENDENT ADVISOR ALLIANCE, CHARLOTTE, NC\n\n\u201cThe statement itself was designed by Powell to be pretty neutral. I don\u2019t think he wanted to make any market moves.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was interesting was that he continues to use the word patient and he\u2019s also using the word transparency. Those are the two key words. He\u2019s indicating the Fed is on hold. I don\u2019t think the Fed is done with this rate hiking cycle.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most important thing to the market is that you\u2019ve an independent Fed that\u2019s going to do the right thing whatever pressure they face from the White House or from Congress ... The Fed should only care about the economy.\u201d\n\nWILLIE DELWICHE, INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, BAIRD, MILWAUKEE\n\n\u201cThe prepared statement is not meaningfully different then what has been said previously.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe question will be how Powell responds to questions from Senators, whether they push him on details for what exactly changed between December and now and what that means going forward.\u201d\n\nOMAIR SHARIF, SENIOR U.S. ECONOMIST, SOCIETE GENERALE, NEW YORK\n\n\u201cThere is nothing here to suggest the Fed will move rates before mid-year at least. He explained why the Fed paused in January. As far as the forward-looking language, the Fed will be data dependent. He hasn\u2019t tipped the Fed\u2019s hands. Maybe the Q&A, there will be more coming out. It could be made he was a little more optimistic than earlier.\n\n\u201cWe were looking for where he stands if things come in line with the Fed\u2019s projections, say 2.0 percent to 2.5 percent growth, are we done with hiking rates like Williams, Daly and Kaplan? Another camp that has emerged is with Mester, Harker and Rosengren, maybe we could do another hike this year. It is not clear where Powell is here.\u201d",

    "text": "EL PASO, Texas (Reuters) - Potential White House hopeful Beto O\u2019Rourke accused Donald Trump of fear-mongering on Monday and the Republican president mocked the Democrat as a \u201cyoung man who lost\u201d in dueling rallies that could preview the tenor of the 2020 election campaign.\n\nO\u2019Rourke, who narrowly lost his 2018 bid for a U.S. Senate seat, accused Trump of stoking \u201cfalse fear\u201d about immigrants and telling \u201clies\u201d about his hometown El Paso, which Trump said was a dangerous place before it had a border fence.\n\n\u201cWe stand for America and we stand against a wall,\u201d O\u2019Rourke told a crowd of several thousand supporters, many waving \u201cBeto 2020\u201d signs and wearing \u201cImmigrants Make America Great\u201d baseball caps. \u201cWalls do not save lives, they end lives.\u201d\n\nTwo hundred yards away in El Paso County Coliseum, Trump told his supporters that O\u2019Rourke had \u201clittle going for himself, although he\u2019s got a great first name.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are all challenged by a young man who lost an election to (Republican Senator) Ted Cruz,\u201d said Trump.\n\nHe said that O\u2019Rourke\u2019s rally was smaller than his, and that was a bad sign: \u201cThat may be the end of his presidential bid.\u201d\n\nReuters could not verify Trump\u2019s claim that 35,000 people attended his rally, with about 10,000 inside. The city\u2019s fire department allowed only the capacity 6,500 inside, the El Paso Times reported. Police estimated between 10,000 and 15,000 attended the O\u2019Rourke march and rally, the newspaper said.\n\nAs the two men spoke, U.S. congressional negotiators said they had reached a tentative deal to try to avert another partial government shutdown. Aides said it did not contain the $5.7 billion Trump wanted for his wall that triggered the shutdown last month.\n\nTrump made clear on Monday he would not drop the demand for a border wall that delights his followers, first made in his campaign in the 2016 election. Giant banners at his rally read \u201cFinish The Wall.\u201d\n\nBeto O'Rourke, the Democratic former Texas congressman, addresses supporters before an anti-Trump march in El Paso, Texas, U.S., February 11, 2019. REUTERS/Loren Elliott\n\nNational polls show the wall is not popular with the majority of voters. A Reuters/IPSOS survey found 43 percent of the U.S. public supported additional border fencing.\n\nTrump said he had heard about a possible deal in Washington before he took the stage, but added: \u201cJust so you know - we\u2019re building the wall anyway. Maybe progress has been made - maybe not.\u201d\n\n\u201cBUILD THE WALL\u201d\n\nIt was Trump\u2019s first direct clash with a potential 2020 rival, albeit on separate stages.\n\nO\u2019Rourke relished the prime-time national platform, sometimes breaking into Spanish, in what sounded like a campaign speech. He decried the Trump administration\u2019s separation of immigrant children from their parents at the border.\n\nHe said Dreamers - undocumented people brought to the United States by their parents when they were children - should be given citizenship, and their parents a pathway to citizenship.\n\n\u201cWith a president who describes Mexican immigrants as rapists and criminals, we have a chance to tell him and the country that immigrants commit crime at a lower rate than Americans who are born in this country,\u201d he said to shouts of \u201cBeto, Beto.\u201d\n\nTrump was pressing his case on immigration in the Democratic bastion of El Paso county, where the population is over 80 percent Hispanic.\n\n\u201cI will never sign a bill that forces the mass release of violent criminals into our country,\u201d he said, referring to a Democratic proposal in the Washington talks to lower the cap on detentions of criminal aliens by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\nSlideshow (19 Images)\n\nUnder Monday\u2019s tentative agreement, the cap would likely stay around the same as in previous years, a congressional aide said.\n\nAlthough O\u2019Rourke\u2019s full-throated denunciation of the president sounded like he planned to run against Trump, the two-time congressman declined to discuss a potential bid when asked by reporters on a conference call on Monday.\n\nO\u2019Rourke told Oprah Winfrey last week he would make a final decision about running for president by the end of the month.",

    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A coalition of 16 U.S. states led by California sued President Donald Trump and top members of his administration on Monday to block his decision to declare a national emergency to obtain funds for building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nThe lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California came after Trump invoked emergency powers on Friday to help build the wall that was his signature 2016 campaign promise.\n\nTrump\u2019s order would allow him to spend on the wall money that Congress appropriated for other purposes. Congress declined to fulfill his request for $5.7 billion to help build the wall this year..\n\n\u201cToday, on Presidents Day, we take President Trump to court to block his misuse of presidential power,\u201d California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re suing President Trump to stop him from unilaterally robbing taxpayer funds lawfully set aside by Congress for the people of our states. For most of us, the office of the presidency is not a place for theater,\u201d added Becerra, a Democrat.\n\nThe White House declined to comment on the filing.\n\nIn a budget deal passed by Congress to avert a second government shutdown, nearly $1.4 billion was allocated toward border fencing. Trump\u2019s emergency order would give him an additional $6.7 billion beyond what lawmakers authorized.\n\nThree Texas landowners and an environmental group filed the first lawsuit against Trump\u2019s move on Friday, saying it violated the Constitution and would infringe on their property rights.\n\nThe legal challenges could slow Trump\u2019s efforts to build the wall, which he says is needed to curb illegal immigration and drug trafficking. The lawsuits could end up at the conservative-leaning U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nColorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Virginia, and Michigan joined California in the lawsuit.\n\nThe states said Trump\u2019s order would cause them to lose millions of dollars in federal funding for national guard units dealing with counter-drug activities and redirection of funds from authorized military construction projects would damage their economies.\n\nA view shows a new section of the border fence in El Paso, Texas, U.S., as seen from Ciudad Juarez, Mexico February 15, 2019. REUTERS/Jose Luis Gonzalez\n\nIn television interviews on Sunday and Monday, Becerra said the lawsuit would use Trump\u2019s own words against him as evidence that there was no national emergency to declare.\n\nTrump said on Friday he did not need to make the emergency declaration but wanted to speed the process of building the wall. That comment could undercut the government\u2019s legal argument.\n\n\u201cBy the president\u2019s own admission, an emergency declaration is not necessary,\u201d the states said in the lawsuit. \u201cThe federal government\u2019s own data prove there is no national emergency at the southern border that warrants construction of a wall.\u201d",

    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican senators on Wednesday urged the top U.S. trade negotiator to counsel President Donald Trump against formally terminating the North American Free Trade Agreement as a way to pressure Congress to act quickly to approve a replacement deal.\n\nU.S. Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-TX) walks to meetings in the U.S. Capitol as deadlines for a federal government shutdown loom in Washington, U.S. December 21, 2018. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nSenator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, told reporters it would be \u201cimmeasurably harder if the president decided to withdraw from NAFTA and then tried to jam Congress.\u201d\n\nCornyn said U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer told senators that it was not his decision and he would pass their concerns onto Trump. Lighthizer declined to comment after meeting with senators for more than 90 minutes.\n\nSenator Charles Grassley, who chairs the Finance Committee that overseas trade issues, said after the meeting that the issue of withdrawing from NAFTA was discussed \u201cand we all said that that would be a bad thing to do.\u201d\n\nAsked why he opposed a withdrawal, Grassley added: \u201cI think it is very unrealistic in any environment to think you\u2019re ever going to get Canada and Mexico back to the bargaining table.\u201d\n\nTrump told reporters on Dec. 1 he planned to give formal notice \u201cwithin a relatively short period of time\u201d and set a six-month deadline for ratification.\n\nBut more than two months later, Trump has not acted. A report on the economic impacts of the new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement has been delayed by the 35-day partial government shutdown and is now not expected until April.\n\nSeveral Republican senators also said they oppose any effort to impose up to 25 percent tariffs on imported cars and trucks on national security grounds. The Commerce Department must deliver the results of its investigation to the White House by Feb. 17.\n\n\u201cIt was made very clear in there that tariffs on autos don\u2019t have much to do with national security,\u201d Grassley said.\n\nSenators also said the White House must get rid of tariffs on imported Canadian and Mexican aluminum and steel if they want to win approval of the trade deal in the U.S. Senate.\n\nSenator Lamar Alexander, a Tennessee Republican, said the metal tariffs are hurting automakers. \u201cThey are making it harder to build cars in Tennessee,\u201d he said Wednesday. \u201cYou can\u2019t build more cars and have more jobs in the United States if you have the highest priced steel.\u201d\n\nAdministration officials told Reuters previously that the auto tariff investigation was a tool to try to win trade concessions from the European Union and Japan. Trump has vowed not to impose new auto tariffs as long as progress is being made.",

    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. consumer prices were unchanged for a third straight month in January, leading to the smallest annual increase in inflation in more than 1-1/2 years, which could allow the Federal Reserve to hold interest rates steady for a while.\n\nA Shell gas station is shown in Encinitas, California January 25, 2016. REUTERS/Mike Blake\n\nThe Labor Department\u2019s report on Wednesday supported the Fed\u2019s recent description of price pressures being \u201cmuted.\u201d In a policy statement last month, the U.S. central bank kept rates unchanged, pledged to be \u201cpatient\u201d before tightening monetary policy further and discarded promises of \u201cfurther gradual increases\u201d in borrowing costs.\n\n\u201cInflation still appears to be well in check,\u201d said Jim Baird, chief investment officer at Plante Moran Financial Advisors in Kalamazoo, Michigan. \u201cThat should be enough for the Fed to take time to evaluate the gradual effects of its prior rate hikes and move more slowly and thoughtfully in administering rate policy in the months ahead.\u201d\n\nThe Consumer Price Index last month was held down by cheaper gasoline, which offset increases in the cost of food, rent, healthcare, recreation, apparel, motor vehicles and household furnishings. In the 12 months through January, the CPI rose 1.6 percent, the smallest gain since June 2017. The CPI increased 1.9 percent on a year-on-year basis in December.\n\nExcluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI gained 0.2 percent, rising by the same margin for a fifth straight month. In the 12 months through January, the so-called core CPI rose 2.2 percent for a third straight month.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast the CPI edging up 0.1 percent in January and the core CPI rising 0.2 percent.\n\nWhile the steady increases in core inflation resulted in the biggest three-month annualized gain in 10 months, economists said they did not believe it signaled a material shift in underlying inflation trends.\n\n\u201cThe Fed will be focused more on longer time frames,\u201d said Eric Winograd, senior economist at AllianceBernstein in New York. \u201cThe quarter-on-quarter annualized figure has moved both higher and lower without signaling any meaningful change in the year-on-year rate before.\u201d\n\nThe dollar rose against a basket of currencies as traders focused on the three-month rise in the core CPI. Prices of U.S. Treasuries fell. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher amid optimism that the United States and China could strike a deal during trade talks in Beijing.\n\nLITTLE UPSIDE RISK\n\nDespite the increases in the core CPI, underlying inflation remains moderate. The Fed, which has a 2 percent inflation target, tracks a different measure, the core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, for monetary policy.\n\nThe core PCE price index increased 1.9 percent on a year-on-year basis in November after rising 1.8 percent in October. It hit 2 percent in March 2018 for the first time since April 2012. PCE price data for December will be released on March 1.\n\nIt was delayed by a five-week partial shutdown of the federal government that ended on Jan. 25.\n\nInflation is remaining moderate despite a tightening labor market, in part because of slowing economic growth in China and Europe, which is helping to lower oil prices.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t see a ton of upside risk to inflation over the next several months,\u201d said Ryan Sweet, a senior economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics in West Chester, Pennsylvania. \u201cThe unemployment rate could fall even further without stoking significant inflation, since the slope of the Phillips curve remains flat.\u201d\n\nThe Phillips curve describes the relationship between inflation and unemployment. It holds that as unemployment declines, inflation should rise. In the current environment, the lack of a strong inflation impulse suggests there is no danger of the labor market overheating.\n\nIn January, gasoline prices fell 5.5 percent after dropping 5.8 percent in December. Food prices increased 0.2 percent, rising for a third straight month. There were increases in the prices of poultry, eggs, fish and beef. But consumers paid less for fruits, vegetables, cereals and dairy products.\n\nA woman shops in the Health & Beauty section of a Whole Foods in Upper St. Clair, Pennsylvania, U.S., February 15, 2018.

It is not whether to support or oppose President Trump,\u201d Collins declared on the Senate floor.\n\n\u201cRather, it is this: Do we want the executive branch, now or in the future, to hold the power that the founders deliberately entrusted to Congress?\u201d\n\nThe resolution, identical to one already approved in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives, is also sponsored by two other senators: Republican Lisa Murkowski and Democrat Jeanne Shaheen. At its present level of support among senators, the measure would need the backing of at least one other Republican to win final Senate approval.\n\nEven with that, however, it might ultimately be only a symbolic gesture of defiance because Trump has vowed to veto the resolution if it arrives on his desk, an action that would likely throw the fight over his emergency into the courts.\n\nTrump declared a national emergency on Feb. 15 after Congress declined to give him the $5.7 billion this year for his wall. The president said emergency powers would empower him to divert money from other accounts already approved by Congress, including military construction projects, to his wall.\n\nAnother Senate Republican, Lamar Alexander, argued Thursday that the president might avoid the clash with Congress if he would take the wall money from Pentagon accounts supporting counter-drug activities, instead of military construction.\n\nDemocrats argue that there is no actual border emergency and even if there were, Trump would still be overreaching.\n\n\u201cThe emergency law that President Trump invoked allows the military to redirect funds only if an emergency \u2018requires use of the armed forces,\u2019\u201d House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler said at a hearing on Trump\u2019s emergency. \u201cThis law is supposed to be used for actions such as building airfields or barracks to help our troops fight wars overseas,\u201d he said.\n\nThe battle in Congress is the latest chapter in a long-running war between Trump and Democrats over border security and immigration policy. A coalition of 16 U.S. states led by California has sued Trump and top members of his administration to block his emergency declaration.\n\nMoody\u2019s Investors Service said on Thursday that Trump\u2019s emergency declaration to build a border wall with Mexico means the U.S. territory of Guam could lose $750 million in military construction funds. This would be a \u201ccredit negative\u201d because the U.S. military presence is one of the island\u2019s dominant economic forces, the credit rating agency said in a statement.",

    "description": "The U.S. House of Representatives votes on Tuesday on a resolution to terminate President Donald Trump\u2019s declaration of a national emergency to build a wall on the border with Mexico.",
    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In a stinging rebuke to President Donald Trump, the House of Representatives on Tuesday brushed aside veto threats and passed legislation to terminate the emergency he declared at the U.S.-Mexico border in order to build a wall there.\n\nBy a vote of 245-182, the House passed the resolution, setting up a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate where the resolution\u2019s chances were slimmer, but seemed to be improving.\n\nWhile passage was a victory for Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the tally was short of what she would likely need to override a possible veto by Republican Trump. Only 13 Republicans supported the move to stop the president\u2019s declaration.\n\nDuring floor debate, Democratic Representative Joaquin Castro, the main sponsor of the controversial legislation, said, \u201cThere is no emergency at the border,\u201d adding, \u201cBorder crossings are at a four-decades low.\u201d\n\nDemocrats and some Republicans worry that with the emergency declaration unilaterally funding his border wall without lawmakers\u2019 approval, Trump was presenting a dangerous challenge to the constitutional balance of powers between Congress and the executive branch of government.\n\nHours before the House vote, Republican Senator John Barrasso, a member of the Senate\u2019s leadership, told MSNBC in an interview that the legislation \u201cmay actually pass the Senate.\u201d\n\nFollowing a closed meeting of Republican senators and Vice President Mike Pence, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refused to predict the outcome, including whether senators ultimately could override a Trump veto.\n\nMcConnell said Republican senators and Pence held a \u201crobust, vigorous discussion\u201d and that he had not \u201creached a total conclusion\u201d over whether Trump\u2019s emergency proclamation was legal.\n\nMeanwhile, the White House formally notified Congress, as expected, that if the measure passes Congress, Trump\u2019s advisers would recommend that he veto it in order to maintain the power he activated on Feb. 15 as a way of circumventing Congress.\n\nTrump argues he has the power to proclaim a national emergency to unilaterally direct existing money for building a border wall that Congress has refused to fully fund.\n\n\u201cThe current situation at the southern border presents a humanitarian and security crisis that threatens core national security interests and constitutes a national emergency,\u201d the White House statement said.\n\nA Trump veto would be the first of his presidency and the first since Republicans lost majority control of the House in last November\u2019s congressional elections.\n\nU.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), flanked by Representative Joaquin Castro (D-TX) (L) and House Democrats hold a news conference about their proposed resolution to terminate U.S. President Trump's Emergency Declaration on the southern border with Mexico, at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, U.S. February 25, 2019. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nOverriding such a veto in Congress would require two-thirds majorities in both chambers, making it highly unlikely, said lawmakers.\n\nThe battle in Congress is the latest chapter in a long-running war between Trump and Democrats over border security, immigration policy and the \u201cgreat, great wall\u201d that Trump has pledged to build since becoming a presidential candidate.\n\nHe originally promised that Mexico would pay for it, but after Mexico refused, he asked U.S. taxpayers to foot the bill for a project Democrats say is unneeded and will not be effective.\n\nIn his first two years in office, Trump\u2019s Republicans controlled both chambers of Congress, which under the U.S. Constitution holds the national purse strings.\n\nDuring that time they failed to appropriate all the money Trump was seeking to build a wall. This year, with Democrats in control of the House, Congress refused Trump\u2019s demand for $5.7 billion in wall funding. Instead, he got $1.37 billion for border barriers this fiscal year.\n\nAngry over that decision, Trump declared the emergency and vowed to divert funds toward the wall from accounts already committed by Congress for other purposes.\n\nOn a separate track from Congress, the future of Trump\u2019s emergency declaration is also likely to be litigated in the courts.\n\nA coalition of 16 U.S. states led by California has already sued Trump and top members of his administration to block his emergency declaration.\n\nWriting on Twitter on Monday, Trump, who says the wall is needed to stop illegal immigration and drugs, warned Republicans not to \u201cfall into the Democrats \u2018trap\u2019 of Open Borders and Crime!\u201d\n\nRepublican Representative Justin Amash was the lone Republican co-sponsoring the resolution in the House.\n\n\u201cThe same congressional Republicans who joined me in blasting Pres. Obama\u2019s executive overreach now cry out for a king to usurp legislative powers,\u201d Amash wrote on Twitter.\n\nThe White House was working to limit Republican support for the measure, especially in the Senate.\n\nSlideshow (7 Images)\n\nNevertheless, Republican Senator Thom Tillis, in an opinion article published in the Washington Post, said he backed Trump on border security, but would vote for the resolution because he \u201ccannot justify providing the executive with more ways to bypass Congress.\u201d\n\nRepublican Senator Lisa Murkowski on Tuesday told reporters she would back the resolution. Previously, her Republican colleague, Susan Collins had said she likely would support the measure, too. For it to pass the Senate, at least one more Republican vote would be needed, assuming all Democrats and two independents back it.",

    "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilding tumbled to a more than two-year low in December as construction of both single and multi-family housing declined, the latest indication that the economy had lost momentum in the fourth quarter.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Development and construction continues on a large scale housing project of over 600 homes in Oceanside, California, U.S., June 25, 2018. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo\n\nBut there was some good news on the economy, with other data on Tuesday showing a rebound in consumer confidence in February after three straight monthly declines. Still, the economy\u2019s outlook continues to be overshadowed by fears of a slowdown in global growth, fading fiscal stimulus, trade tensions and uncertainty over Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union.\n\nThese risks were again highlighted by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell when he reaffirmed before lawmakers on Tuesday the U.S. central bank\u2019s \u201cpatient\u201d stance towards raising interest rates further this year.\n\n\u201cRegardless, the economy is moderating ... which means the Fed should be able to maintain its cautious approach to monetary policy,\u201d said Joel Naroff, chief economist at Naroff Economic Advisors in Holland, Pennsylvania.\n\nHousing starts dropped 11.2 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.078 million units in December, the weakest reading since September 2016. Data for November was revised down to show starts at a 1.214 million unit rate instead of the previously reported pace of 1.256 million units.\n\nOther details of the report were also downbeat, suggesting the housing market could remain sluggish for a while despite an easing in mortgage rates. Housing completions hit a more than one-year low in December, and while building permits rose, they were driven by the volatile multi-family housing segment.\n\nEconomists polled by Reuters had forecast that housing starts would slip to a pace of 1.250 million units last month.\n\nThe release of the December housing starts and building permits report was delayed by a 35-day partial shutdown of the federal government that ended on Jan. 25. No date has been set for the release of January\u2019s report.\n\nThe Commerce Department said while delays in data collection could make it more difficult to determine the exact start and completion dates of construction, \u201cprocessing and data quality were monitored and no significant issues were identified.\u201d\n\nThe report joined weak December retail sales and business spending plans on equipment in suggesting that economic growth cooled down significantly at the tail end of 2018. It also implied that residential investment likely contracted in the fourth quarter, extending a decline that began in early 2018.\n\nAs a result, the Atlanta Fed trimmed its fourth-quarter gross domestic product estimate by one-tenth of a percentage point to a 1.8 percent annualized rate. The economy grew at a 3.4 percent pace in the third quarter.\n\nA second report from the Conference Board on Tuesday showed its consumer confidence index increased 9.7 points to a reading of 131.4 in February after being held back by financial market volatility and the government shutdown.\n\nDespite the rebound in confidence, the Conference Board said it expected the pace of economic growth to moderate in 2019.\n\nThe U.S. dollar fell to a three-week low against a basket of major currencies. U.S. Treasury prices rose, while stocks on Wall Street were little changed in volatile trade.\n\nSOFT PATCH\n\nThe housing market hit a soft patch last year amid higher mortgage rates as well as land and labor shortages, which led to tight inventories and more expensive homes.\n\nBut there are some glimmers of hope. A third report from S&P/Case-Shiller on Tuesday showed house prices in the 20-metro area increased 4.2 percent from a year ago in December, the smallest gain since November 2014, after rising 4.6 percent in November.\n\nSlowing house price inflation was also corroborated by a fourth report from the Federal Housing Finance Agency showing house prices rose 0.3 percent on a monthly basis in December after advancing 0.4 percent in November.\n\nModerating house prices together with declining mortgage rates and steadily rising wages could make home buying more affordable, though economists expect the housing market weakness to persist at least through the first half of 2019.\n\n\u201cWe do expect the housing data to pick up at some point in response to the recent decline in mortgage rates, but it likely will take some time before we start to see firming across many of the relevant figures,\u201d said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.\n\nA survey last week showed homebuilder confidence increased in February, but builders continued to say costs were being kept high by land and labor shortages, and tariffs on lumber and other key building materials.\n\nPermits for future home construction rose 0.3 percent to a rate of 1.326 million units in December. Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, dropped 6.7 percent to a rate of 758,000 units in December, the lowest level since August 2016.\n\nIt was the fourth straight monthly decline in single-family homebuilding. Single-family starts dropped in the Northeast, Midwest and West, but rose in the South.\n\nPermits to build single-family homes fell 2.2 percent in December to a pace of 829,000 units. Starts for the multi-family housing segment dropped 20.4 percent to a rate of 320,000 units in December. Permits for the construction of multi-family homes rose 4.9 percent to a pace of 497,000 units.\n\nHousing completions fell 2.7 percent to 1.097 million units, the fewest since September 2017. Realtors estimate that housing starts and completion rates need to be in a range of 1.5 million to 1.6 million units per month to plug the inventory gap.",

REUTERS/Thomas White/Illustration\n\nLast year, the dollar outperformed on higher rates and a robust economy. But it had already started turning down before the Fed\u2019s policy U-turn last week on worries that the U.S.-China trade war was putting downward pressure on growth.\n\nThe poll of 70 currency strategists taken Jan 31-Feb 6 showed the U.S. dollar is forecast to give up most of 2018\u2019s gains against major currencies over the coming year.\n\nNearly 80 percent of strategists who answered an additional question said the dollar rally has already stalled, up sharply from over 60 percent one month ago.\n\nReuters poll: Has the U.S. dollar rally stalled? - tmsnrt.rs/2t5ZKoh\n\nThe remaining respondents who expect the dollar\u2019s ascent to continue said better U.S. economic performance versus its peers and a reassessment on rates by the Fed will drive the greenback further.\n\nBut Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the case for rate increases had weakened in recent weeks, citing \u201ccross-currents\u201d such as slowing growth overseas and the longest federal government shutdown in history that just ended.\n\nThat clearly indicates the Fed will adopt a cautious approach this year following four rate increases in 2018, a view held by a majority of economists in a separate Reuters poll.\n\n\u201cIt seems that the 2018 playbook of the dollar strength \u2013 U.S. growth outperformance, continued Fed rate hikes, and tighter liquidity conditions from the balance sheet \u2013 is reversing,\u201d noted strategists at Morgan Stanley.\n\n\u201cForward-looking U.S. data such as business and consumer confidence suggest a slowing domestic economy, and the shift in Fed rhetoric suggests that rates will be lower and the balance sheet larger than previously thought. This is a recipe for dollar weakness.\u201d\n\nThe latest poll once again predicted most major currencies will strengthen against the dollar in the year ahead.\n\nBut any significant gains for other currencies will likely be limited. A synchronized global economic slowdown is already under way, keeping major central banks on the sidelines.\n\n\u201cThis is probably as good as it is likely to get for the dollar,\u201d said Lee Hardman, currency strategist at MUFG, adding: \u201cthe Fed has become more dovish than we had anticipated more quickly and has increased the risks that the dollar may weaken more notably.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the other side of the coin is the story outside of the U.S. - the fundamentals are still weak and it is difficult to find currencies to stop the dollar at this point in time.\u201d\n\nSpeculators increased their bets in favor of the greenback to the highest since December 2015 in the last week of 2018 - the most recent data - according to data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, suggesting a long-dollar position is a crowded trade.\n\nBut all is not well on the other side of that trade.\n\nEuro zone growth has also slowed sharply and is likely to restrain the European Central Bank - which only just stopped buying billions of euros worth of bonds each month - from lifting interest rates off the floor any time soon.\n\n\u201cMaybe we will see a recovery in euro zone growth this year, but economic data is just not supportive of that. Right now, it is difficult to be bullish on the euro,\u201d said Jane Foley, senior FX strategist at Rabobank.\n\nThe euro was at best forecast to claw back its around 5 percent losses against the dollar since the start of last year. The single currency was forecast to trade around $1.20 in a year from about $1.14 on Wednesday.\n\n\u201cWhen everything else is looking a bit bearish, why sell the dollar?\u201d asked Foley. \u201cIf you are going to sell the dollar, then you\u2019ve got to buy something else - what will you buy in an environment where global growth is slowing and the outlook for other currencies is potentially worse.\u201d\n\nSterling\u2019s path will largely be dependent on how Britain\u2019s departure from the European Union pans out.\n\nBut it is clear the main beneficiaries are beaten-down emerging market currencies. Most have bounced back smartly this year as a decisively dovish Fed has provided the impetus.\n\n\u201cCurrencies in emerging markets are undervalued and should benefit from a shift in the Fed\u2019s rhetoric,\u201d said Petr Krpata, chief EMEA FX and interest rate strategist at ING.\n\nCurrencies usually sensitive to commodity prices may also do well.\n\n\u201cNo longer does it appear that central banks will be trying to put the brakes on,\u201d said Greg Anderson, global head of foreign exchange strategy at BMO Capital Markets in New York. \u201cIt is a double positive for commodity-linked currencies.\u201d",

Now, \u201cit\u2019s up to Sean Hannity and Ann Coulter to decide if the president will sign it\u201d, Kimmel said. Trump seemed unmoved by the deal, instead leading a rally of his supporters in El Paso, Texas, in a modified chant of \u201cfinish the wall\u201d.\n\nHold up, Kimmel said. \u201cHow do you finish a wall you haven\u2019t even started building yet?\u201d\n\nSeveral weeks ago, Kimmel continued, he joked that the president should just lie and say he is building the wall because supporters would believe him; they\u2019re not going to check its progress in person.\n\nAs it turns out, \u201cthat\u2019s exactly what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s skipped from \u2018build the wall\u2019 to \u2018finish the wall\u2019. That\u2019s how Orwellian this has become,\u201d Kimmel said.\n\n\u201cWe are one delusional rally away from: \u2018Now that we\u2019ve finished the wall, let\u2019s paint the wall!\u2019\u201d\n\nTrevor Noah: \u2018He\u2019d prefer to just get them riled up\u2019\n\nOn The Daily Show, Trevor Noah also contextualized the El Paso rally, in which Trump pandered to his Texas supporters and said he wasn\u2019t interested in reading the budget agreement reached by a bipartisan committee.\n\nThat the president spurned a proposal to the keep the government open for a rally is not surprising, Noah said, but still \u201ca pretty insane admission. President Trump is saying instead of getting informed and then passing that information on to his audience, he\u2019d prefer to just get them riled up.\u201d\n\nAlso on brand: remixing his chants based on fictional developments. At the El Paso rally, Trump modified his now-standard \u201cbuild the wall\u201d chant to \u201cfinish the wall\u201d.\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019re doing \u2018finish the wall\u2019?\u201d Noah mused. \u201cI don\u2019t know how much actual work they\u2019re doing on the border, but I guess in Trump\u2019s chant world, they\u2019re making a lot of progress.\u201d\n\nNoah offered some context: although no new miles of wall have been built under Trump, there has been upgrading of fencing into taller fencing.\n\nIn other words: \u201cHe\u2019s solved the problem of smugglers who are determined to sneak drugs into America but are too lazy to buy a somewhat taller ladder.\u201d\n\nIn sum, the El Paso Trump rally was a Trump rally, although we learned one new thing: \u201cIn addition to words, the president seems to struggle with numbers too,\u201d Noah said in reference to the president\u2019s claim that he\u2019s 1-1 in elections and soon to be 2-0.\n\n\u201cUh, that\u2019s not how math works,\u201d Noah said, \u201cbut at least now we know how Trump successfully negotiated negative $200m for his wall.\u201d\n\nStephen Colbert: \u2018Deal, arted\u2019\n\nOn The Late Show, Stephen Colbert was \u201cfeeling very TBD\u201d about the bipartisan budget deal from Congress, which may or may not keep the government open at the end of the week.\n\n\u201cI will be conditionally impressed at some later date,\u201d he said.\n\nThe new budget deal allocates $1.375bn for border security \u2013 less than the $1.6bn offered in a deal rejected by Trump in December, kicking off the longest government shutdown in American history \u2013 and represents some \u201cA+ negotiating\u201d by the president, Colbert observed. \u201cDeal, arted.\u201d\n\nNaturally, the agreement has been trashed by conservative talking heads \u2013 Laura Ingraham called it \u201cpathetic\u201d and Sean Hannity said it\u2019s \u201ca garbage compromise\u201d \u2013 and on Tuesday, \u201cTrump agreed with those people who tell him what he agrees with\u201d, Colbert said. But though the president said he\u2019s not happy with the deal, he didn\u2019t rule out signing it. Instead, Trump proposed funding a physical wall by diverting funds from \u201cfar less important areas\u201d: in practice, areas such as disaster relief for California and Puerto Rico.\n\nIn translation: \u201cTrump\u2019s plan is to divert funds from actual disasters in order to prevent fictional ones,\u201d Colbert said.",

    "text": "The Michelin-starred mastermind behind a 31-restaurant empire gained a new level of recognition with his relief efforts in disaster-hit zones such as Puerto Rico\n\nA nonstop stream of people of different ages, races and genders gawked, high-fived or chatted excitedly to chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s as he attempted to pose for pictures in the last shreds of daylight earlier this week in Washington, DC.\n\nOne woman didn\u2019t know his name but did know he was the man she had seen on television feeding federal workers during the government shutdown. A heap of praise spilled from her mouth and she asked if she could simply shake Andr\u00e9s\u2019s hand.\n\nAnother person asked if Andr\u00e9s would run for president. Some shouted \u201cthank you,\u201d others \u201cgreat job!\u201d and one young man simply muttered \u201clegend\u201d as he walked by.\n\nAndr\u00e9s practically owned the block where he stood \u2013 within walking distance were five of the 31 restaurants in his empire \u2013 but these days his fame is more about the hundreds of ham and cheese sandwiches he puts together in disaster zones than the sea urchin set in a droplet of clarified ham stock in his two-Michelin-starred restaurant, minibar.\n\nIt\u2019s the humanitarian work that has landed Andr\u00e9s a nomination for the Nobel peace prize. In 2010, Andr\u00e9s founded the not-for-profit World Central Kitchen, which works to ensure people in crisis zones are being fed.\n\n\u201cEven in a rich country like America, we can be very bad at managing a tragedy like Katrina or Maria,\u201d Andr\u00e9s told the Guardian in an interview at his office, referring to some of the US\u2019s worst hurricanes. Every surface is so cluttered with trinkets that a sword gifted to him by the people of La Mancha, Spain, rests on top of the couch.\n\nHe continued: \u201cI think we are always in this crazy battle about what\u2019s the right price to keep people safe.\u201d\n\nAndr\u00e9s is from Asturias in northern Spain, a region famous for its dairy produce and apple cider. He moved to the US in 1991 after training under his close friend, the founder of El Bulli, Ferran Adri\u00e0.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s gives a tour to the speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, of the resource center at the World Central Kitchen for furloughed federal workers on 22 January in Washington DC. Photograph: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nIn the next two decades, he collected accolade after accolade for cooking, became a television star chef in both his native and adopted country and was credited with helping popularize tapas in the US.\n\nWith a network of respected restaurants in DC, Andr\u00e9s found he had an indirect audience with politicians. He would use his platform to advocate for immigrant rights, not only as an immigrant himself, but also as a chef who knew how, from farm to table, immigrants are often involved with every step of a meal.\n\nThese days, he walks the halls of Congress, preaching the message to \u201cbuild longer tables, shorter walls\u201d, but his relationship with the current decision-makers in the White House is weaker than it was under presidents George W Bush and Barack Obama.\n\nIn 2015, Andr\u00e9s pulled out of a plan to open one of his restaurants in Trump\u2019s hotel in Washington because of the president\u2019s hateful rhetoric towards immigrants on the campaign trail. The Trump Organization sued Andr\u00e9s, who sued them back. It ended in a settlement with both parties saying they resolved their differences \u201cas friends\u201d.\n\nAndr\u00e9s said Trump\u2019s rhetoric around immigration was smart as a tactic: \u201cHe understands there is a very simple way to unify those people that feel alone, that feel forgotten and where you find an enemy it is easier to understand your lack of success.\u201d\n\nThis \u201cus versus them\u201d mentality has always plagued society, Andr\u00e9s noted. It just so happens that at this moment, it is being led by one of the most powerful people in the world. \u201cHe [Trump] is not bringing out the best in all of us, he is bringing out the worst in some of us,\u201d Andr\u00e9s said.\n\nAndr\u00e9s said anti-immigrant sentiment, in Europe and the US, is rife with illogic. From a purely practical standpoint, Andr\u00e9s said people should understand that helping the poor and addressing the root causes of immigration would enrich everyone. \u201cThe delusion of comfort of our lives is only temporary,\u201d he said.\n\nHe has seen firsthand, over and over again, how quickly people\u2019s lives can be upended, during his personal travels and in his work with World Central Kitchen.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s helps prepare food at a World Central Kitchen facility in Haiti in 2014. Photograph: Marvin Joseph/The Washington Post/Getty Images\n\nThe aid group was born out of Andr\u00e9s\u2019s trip to Haiti after the 2010 earthquake that left between 46,000 and 85,000 people dead. He had witnessed poverty in favelas in Rio de Janeiro and in slums in Nairobi, but the way cheaply constructed buildings had left Haiti in rubble had a profound impact on him.\n\nWorld Central Kitchen helped get food and water to Haitians and supported long-term projects to improve school kitchens and conduct food safety training. For the next few years, they quietly did work in Brazil, Peru and Cambodia.\n\nThen, Hurricane Maria happened.\n\nIt\u2019s not often that a ham and cheese sandwich instills hope into millions of people, but in the days after Hurricane Maria, when apocalyptic scenes greeted Puerto Rico\u2019s 3.5 million residents, a pile of sandwiches with a hearty dose of mayonnaise did just that.\n\nThe federal government was slow to respond to the September 2017 hurricane that knocked out the US island territory\u2019s power grid, and aid agencies struggled to overcome bureaucratic red tape and gas shortages to get desperately needed supplies across the island.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ducks perch on the branch of a tree next to a home destroyed by Hurricane Maria in Toa Baja, Puerto Rico. Photograph: Ram\u00f3n Espinosa/AP\n\nThen, suddenly, news of World Central Kitchen\u2019s meal operation emerged on social media.\n\nAndr\u00e9s and his team had mobilized chefs, fought to obtain food and hunted down a functioning kitchen on the island. For two weeks in October, they made 120,000 to 150,000 meals a day. By late June 2018, World Central Kitchen had cooked more than 3.6m meals in Puerto Rico.\n\n\u201cI took it like it was my problem, it was my mission,\u201d Andr\u00e9s said. \u201cNobody named me \u2013 nobody told me \u2018you are the food tsar\u2019 and maybe sometimes I sound crazy when I mention this, but I wouldn\u2019t mind if they told me: \u2018you are the food tsar.\u2019\u201d\n\nAndr\u00e9s is very critical of the bureaucracy that slowed aid efforts and last year published a book, We Fed an Island, a pointed critique of the response to Maria.\n\nNow if there is a crisis in the news, there is probably a swift group chat on Andr\u00e9s\u2019s phone about how to get food there. In 2018, they served more than 3m meals in Puerto Rico, California, Hawaii, Guatemala, Indonesia, North Carolina, Florida and Mexico after various catastrophes.\n\nIt\u2019s not just about preparing a bowl of rice and beans or handing out bottled water, but about finding people who need help, and creating an infrastructure to get them food and supplies, he explained.\n\nIt\u2019s about finding what went wrong in the first place and how they can help a population so the next time a hurricane rolls around, its entire local food economy won\u2019t be decimated.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest damaged Puerto Rican national flag spray painted with the words \u201cTogether as One\u201d hangs from the facade of a business, in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Photograph: Ram\u00f3n Espinosa/AP\n\nIn Puerto Rico, World Central Kitchen no longer serves thousands of meals a day, but has provided grants to local farmers in an effort to steer the island from its import-heavy food economy.\n\nPeople stop Andr\u00e9s on the street for this work, but also for the way he has called out the president and other people in power in Puerto Rico and during the shutdown for failing to address the impact their actions had on people\u2019s livelihoods.\n\nMost of that commentary happens on Twitter. In September, Trump challenged reports that the death toll in Puerto Rico was thousands more than estimated. \u201cThat People die is a fact! That they died on your watch is a fact!\u201d Andr\u00e9s responded.\n\nBut for all that criticism, his anger was most apparent when describing his own work in Puerto Rico. Andr\u00e9s fiddled with the sword from La Mancha, slowly sliding the weapon in and out its sheath, while his voice got louder and louder.\n\nTrump awarded himself a \u201c10 out of 10\u201d in Puerto Rico and, in response, Andr\u00e9s wrote in his book that his own work was a five. In an interview with CBS, Andr\u00e9s said he failed in Puerto Rico by not opening his restaurant in Trump\u2019s DC hotel, where he could have, maybe, grabbed the ear of the president or his accomplices, and wished he had fed more meals.\n\nHe faults himself for not having the right connections with this administration, for not calling up Ivanka Trump, the president\u2019s daughter, whom he knows. He is most angry when explaining how when there is an emergency at a restaurant, the boss takes charge and adapts.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like I went there complaining and screaming,\u201d Andr\u00e9s said. \u201cI screamed and complained once I saw the lack of readiness, the lack of preparedness, the lack of listening and the lack of adapting to the situation.\u201d",

    "title": "The trade war with China is top strand in the White House soap | Larry Elliott",
    "description": "Donald Trump may be a ham actor but he\u2019s got the whole world on tenterhooks now Art is supposed to hold a mirror up to society but in the case of Donald Trump the opposite is the case. Current events in the White House increasingly mirror the soap opera of th\u2026",
    "text": "Art is supposed to hold a mirror up to society butfor Donald Trump the opposite is the case. Current events in the White House increasingly mirror the soap opera of the West Wing only with a rightwing nationalist rather than a social democratic globalist at the helm.\n\nAs with the TV series, there are a number of interwoven plots. Is Trump involved in an attempt to smear the world\u2019s richest man, Jeff Bezos? Will the probing by the special counsel Robert Mueller lead to the president\u2019s impeachment? Will the president\u2019s battle with Congress over a wall along the border with Mexico lead to a second shutdown of the government?\n\nBut the main story line this week is whether Trump is getting ready to do a deal with China over trade. Last week, hopes of an agreement before a 90-day truce runs out on 1 March were fading. That episode ended with the president announcing that he had no plans to meet China\u2019s president Xi Jinping before the deadline.\n\nBut all good soaps have a twist and as talks between middle-ranking Chinese and American officials began in Beijing, the White House let it be known that Trump and Xi might indeed meet \u201cvery soon\u201d. Wall Street, which wants the trade war to be over as quickly as possible, loved that.\n\nThe financial markets are getting ahead of themselves. A clearer idea of whether Trump wants a peace deal will come later in the week when the US trade representative Robert Lighthizer and the treasury secretary Steve Mnuchin join the talks. Here too, though, there is an element of drama, because Lighthizer is a hawk and Mnuchin a dove.\n\nTrump will eventually have to decide which of the two men to listen to \u2013 but probably not for a while yet. His instincts are those of a protectionist and his belief is that China has been playing fast and loose with trade rules for too long. Mnuchin\u2019s argument that trade wars are bad for shares is less compelling now that the Federal Reserve has removed the threat of further increases in interest rates.\n\nAnd, let\u2019s face, Trump is an actor \u2013 a ham actor, admittedly \u2013 who simply adores the limelight. This one is going to run a bit longer, with some cliffhangers along the way.\n\nA switch in time\n\nE.ON has become the first of the big six energy suppliers to raise its tariffs after the regulator, Ofgem, raised the price cap. It won\u2019t take long for the other five to follow suit. Anybody who is on a default tariff can expect to see their bill increase by 10% from April \u2013 five times the current rate of inflation.\n\nIn one sense, Ofgem\u2019s new tariff is to domestic energy users what university fees are to students: a ceiling rather than a cap. There is a tendency among the major energy players to charge the maximum allowed. In that respect, the big six operate in classic oligopoly fashion: they don\u2019t compete on price.\n\nYet the university comparison is not entirely accurate because there are now a total of around 60 suppliers in the energy market and those outside of the big six have won a 25% share of the market by wooing consumers with lower prices.\n\nSign up to the daily Business Today email or follow Guardian Business on Twitter at @BusinessDesk\n\nE.ON and the other members of the big six are clearly not too bothered about that process continuing, as it now inevitably will. In truth, they are more interested in diversifying out of energy supply and developing other parts of their businesses.\n\nTo be sure, some of the new, smaller suppliers go bust and every household pays a small supplement on their bill to pay for that. But the costs are much smaller than the potential benefits of switching, which is why so many of us are shopping around.\n\nCounting on the counter-cyclical\n\nWonder of wonders, the incurably pessimistic financial blog site Zero Hedge has found something to be cheerful about: the prediction by Nobel prize winning economist Paul Krugman of a US recession within two years. Given his self-confessed dodgy track record, markets might see Krugman\u2019s crystal-ball gazing as a reason to buy, Zero Hedge suggests. Well, perhaps. It\u2019s a question of which is the bigger counter-cyclical indicator: Krugman saying there will be a recession or Zero Hedge saying there won\u2019t be.",

    "text": "The Belgian prime minister has appealed to employers and trade unions to resume their negotiations over working conditions after a general strike forced the cancellation of flights across the country for the first time in its history, as well as a shutdown of schools and blockades at factories.\n\nAs Belgium ground to a halt in the face of the 24-hour national strike, the fifth in the last 25 years, Charles Michel said there was no alternative but to resume talks.\n\n\u201cTrade unions and employers must return to the negotiating table,\u201d he said. \u201cThe strike does not solve anything. I want to thank all those who work today.\u201d\n\nThe unions directing the action are calling for wage increases, an improved work-life balance, better pensions and earlier retirement ages.\n\nBelgian airports were forced to cancel nearly all services after the country\u2019s air traffic control body, Skeyes, shut airspace over the country for 24 hours from 10pm on Tuesday because of staff shortages.\n\nThe move caused flight disruption across Europe with Brussels airport, the country\u2019s busiest hub, warning that the strike would affect about 60,000 people.\n\n\n\nElsewhere on Wednesday, dock workers were not loading or unloading ships in the port of Antwerp.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Workers use shopping trolleys to block the entrance to a Carrefour supermarket in Brussels. Photograph: Geert Vanden Wijngaert/AP\n\nKathleen Van De Vijver, a spokesman for the prisons service, said it had suffered a \u201cmajor impact\u201d with nearly two-thirds of guards off work, forcing authorities to restrict prisoners to their cells.\n\nBrussels\u2019 metro, tram and bus provider ran just a handful of lines and the national rail operator, SNCB, said about half its train services were running.\n\nCompanies picketed included Mercedes, Peugeot and Volvo, where the major factory in Ghent said it would not produce a single car as only 30 of its 6,000 staff had arrived for work.\n\nIn Antwerp, one-third of primary schools were closed and across the country many libraries, museums and sports institutions were shut.\n\nBart Bijnens of the ABVV union described the action as a \u201cgreat success\u201d as it highlighted workers\u2019 anger at a planned government cap on wage increases to 0.8% over the next two years.\n\nPaul Buekenhout from the Christian trade union criticised the quality of work and conditions on offer in Belgium\u2019s airports, \u201cboth in the handling and in the airlines and the cleaning\u201d.\n\nFouad Bougrine, of the liberal union, the ACLVB, said: \u201cPeople do not like to drag luggage up until they are 67 years old. They also want to spend time with their grandchildren, for example \u2013 they are really angry.\u201d\n\nMichel has insisted the wage cap proposed by the central council of the economy does not take into account the indexing of salaries to the costs of living, which would see an \u201ceffective salary increase of 4.6%\u201d by 2020.\n\nIn comments that were angrily denounced by strikers, the prime minister of Flanders, in the north of Belgium, attacked the unions for spreading \u201cuntruthful populism\u201d.\n\nGeert Bourgeois said: \u201cDo I want to say with all these figures that there is no problem? Of course not. Every poor person is too much for me and we have to keep working on a warm and social Flanders.

    "description": "Several organizations are suing the federal government on behalf of 36 people whose visa waivers were denied or delayed On their first date in April 2015, Fereshteh Abbasi and Chris Gibson couldn\u2019t settle on a place to get drinks. Unable to think of a place, \u2026",
    "text": "Several organizations are suing the federal government on behalf of 36 people whose visa waivers were denied or delayed\n\nOn their first date in April 2015, Fereshteh Abbasi and Chris Gibson couldn\u2019t settle on a place to get drinks. Unable to think of a place, they started walking around their neighborhood in Philadelphia.\n\n\u201cI was thinking he was so charming, friendly and sweet,\u201d Abbasi said. They finally settled on a German bar.\n\nThough they were indecisive on where to go for that first date, when it came to the decision to get married, the couple was set. Gibson proposed in June 2016, and they got married that August.\n\nOn 27 January 2017, Donald Trump attempted to fulfill his campaign promise to implement \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States\u201d and unrolled the first version of a travel ban that mainly targeted Muslim-majority countries.\n\nHow the US government created a fake university to snare immigrant students Read more\n\nFor Abbasi, who is from Iran, \u201cthat was the worst night of my life,\u201d she said. That month, she moved to Grenada since her husband attended medical school there. \u201cI was just sitting in front of the TV, crying and wondering what\u2019s going to happen to us and if I could ever return to the United States.\u201d\n\nAbbasi is still unsure if she can move back to the United States with her husband, who is a US citizen. She has yet to get a decision on the waiver she applied for in July 2017. Though it\u2019s been over two years since the travel ban started, thousands of people from countries under the ban have been in a seemingly indefinite waiting period.\n\nAlthough there are harsh restrictions on travelers from countries under the ban, which was upheld by the supreme court in June, people can apply for waivers to enter the country. The ban states that close family to US citizens, such as spouses, are appropriate waiver recipients. But many argue the waiver system is a sham because so few people are getting waivers.\n\nThe number of people affected by delays is unclear. The only data made public shows that as of last April, 579 waivers were granted from 33,176 applicants. The state department did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Newsha Tavakoli is from Atlanta, but her husband, Mohammad Esnaashari, is from Iran. They are waiting for a visa to come to the US. Photograph: The Guardian\n\nBefore the travel ban, it would take about two years for a spouse or fiance of a US citizen to get a visa. A visa would typically be granted about six months after an interview.\n\nNewsha Tavakoli of Atlanta said her husband in Iran, Mohammad Esnaashari, had his interview in July. He\u2019s been receiving the same \u201cadministrative processing\u201d email for months.\n\n\u201cNinety percent of my thoughts every day is, \u2018How can I get out of this situation\u2019,\u201d Tavakoli said. \u201cIt\u2019s like I\u2019m stuck in this situation, and there\u2019s not much I can do about it.\u201d\n\nTavakoli and Abbasi said they have connected with more than 600 couples in the same situation on the Iranian social media platform Telegram. A group on the platform share updates and strategies on getting through the process, though no one seems to have the answers, including immigration lawyers.\n\nTaha Bahadori of Seattle said his lawyer told him and his wife, Sama Ghoba, that he couldn\u2019t take on their case because there is no information about what guarantees a visa waiver.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Taha Bahadori and his wife, Sama Ghoba, were told by an immigration lawyer that there is no information about what guarantees a visa waiver. Photograph: The Guardian\n\n\u201cThere are a lot of questions the state department has not answered,\u201d said Shabnam Lofti, an immigration lawyer based in Wisconsin. \u201cIt makes it difficult for attorneys to provide counsel when we\u2019re in the dark.\u201d\n\nLofti said a few of her clients have divorced or broken up because the wait time put such a strain on their relationships.\n\nArya Salem of Virginia said he feels guilty for putting his wife, Roxana Ranjbaran, through the stress and anxiety of entering the United States. To make up for it, he travels to meets her in countries where both US and Iranian citizens are welcomed, like Turkey.\n\nLofti and several not-for-profit organizations are suing the federal government on behalf of 36 people whose visa waivers were denied or delayed. A judge in the US district court of northern California agreed to let the case move forward, denying the government\u2019s request to dismiss the case.\n\n\u201cPeople don\u2019t realize that their fellow Americans are impacted by this,\u201d said Brian Swank of New Jersey whose fiancee, Mehraneh Rayatidamavandi, lives in Iran. \u201cAmerican families are being torn apart.\u201d\n\nSwank said the physical separation from his fiancee has caused them both anxiety and depression, but they try to Facetime multiple times a day.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not giving up on our dreams. We\u2019re not questioning whether we should be together,\u201d Swank said. \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018how can we make it through this?\u2019\u201d\n\n",

    "text": "Top story: \u2018Long extension if they don\u2019t vote for deal\u2019\n\nHello \u2013 Warren Murray presenting the news sifted and unbleached.\n\nTheresa May\u2019s Brexit strategy may have been accidentally revealed after her chief negotiator, Olly Robbins, was overheard in a Brussels bar suggesting that MPs will be given a last-minute choice between voting for her deal or accepting a long extension to article 50. According to ITV, Robbins said the government had \u201cgot to make them believe that the week beginning end of March \u2026 extension is possible, but if they don\u2019t vote for the deal then the extension is a long one\u201d.\n\nThe tactic appears to be aimed at the European Research Group (ERG) faction of hard-Brexit Tories, who fear the EU exit could end up being cancelled altogether if MPs accept a delay or extension of the article 50 process. The leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom, refused to deny on Tuesday morning that the Commons could be denied a \u201cmeaningful vote\u201d until after the next scheduled European council meeting, which is due to be held on 21 March. In the Commons, May has appealed to MPs for more time to sort out the Irish border backstop. If she does seek to delay until late March, May is likely to face a fierce backlash from MPs who believe every day of uncertainty increases the risks to jobs and businesses.\n\nMidweek catch-up\n\n> Britain\u2019s foreign secretary has condemned an attack on the BBC cameraman Ron Skeans at Donald Trump\u2019s rally in El Paso. Trump was seen asking Skeans \u201cAre you alright?\u201d as the assailant was removed. Trump supporters regularly threaten the media.\n\n> Trump meanwhile has grumbled that he is not \u201cthrilled\u201d with a deal struck to avoid another government shutdown. It provides $1.4bn for border barriers including 55 miles of fencing, built on existing designs such as metal slats, in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas.\n\n> Gambling adverts are to be banned from websites and computer games that are popular with children. Bookmakers will also be required to stop using celebrities or other people who appear to be under 25 in their promotions.\n\n> The Mexican cartel boss Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n has been found guilty of 10 counts of drug trafficking following a dramatic three-month trial in New York. Guzm\u00e1n is to be sentenced on 25 June and is expected to receive life without parole.\n\n> The Tate Modern has won a court case against residents of neighbouring luxury apartments who didn\u2019t like patrons of the gallery being able to see in their windows.\n\n\u2018It was hell\u2019 \u2013 Thursday will mark one year since 17 people were shot and killed at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida. Vigils, moments of silence and an interfaith service are among events planned to commemorate the victims of America\u2019s deadliest ever high school shooting. Students and their families will gather in the city\u2019s largest park to remember their friends, and a clean-up will be held on the favourite beach of one of the victims, 14-year-old Alyssa Alhadeff. For Anthony Borges, 15, who survived terrible gunshot injuries but has been left debilitated, the priority is healing, trying to shake off the nightmares and maybe one day get back on the soccer pitch. \u201cI feel free, you know? On the pitch all the stress, all the problems. They\u2019re gone.\u201d\n\nTrouble for Trudeau \u2013 A minister in Justin Trudeau\u2019s Canadian government has resigned amid allegations the prime minister\u2019s office pressured her to avoid prosecuting a major engineering firm.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jody Wilson-Raybould resigned from Justin Trudeau\u2019s ministry after being demoted from the justice portfolio. Photograph: Adrian Wyld/AFP/Getty Images\n\nJody Wilson-Raybould was demoted last month from the office of justice minister. The Globe and Mail reported that people in Trudeau\u2019s office had tried to pressure Wilson-Raybould to help construction company SNC-Lavalin Group Inc avoid a corruption trial. Canada\u2019s independent ethics commissioner is investigating the affair. Opinion polls show Trudeau\u2019s Liberals have a slender lead over the official opposition Conservatives ahead of an election set for this October.\n\nFrackers knocked back \u2013 The shale gas firm Cuadrilla has lost its bid for approval to frack at a second site in Lancashire. James Brokenshire, the communities secretary, said he turned down the appeal for planning permission in the Fylde area because of traffic impact around the Roseacre Wood site. Cuadrilla recently admitted commercial fracking in the UK is impossible under the government\u2019s seismicity rules, after work was repeatedly paused at its existing Preston New Road site after triggering minor earthquakes. The government has said it has no plans to review the regulations.\n\nDrive away a great deal \u2013 The government of Papua New Guinea is missing nearly 300 imported cars provided for officials to use during the Apec regional summit. PNG police said nine were stolen, others were damaged or stripped of parts, and some disappeared into the jungle highlands. The government of the impoverished country notoriously imported 40 luxury Maserati Quattroporte sedans and three super-luxury Bentley Flying Spurs for the summit and says it at least knows where they are \u2013 \u201clocked away in the old wharf shed down on the main wharf\u201d.\n\nToday in Focus podcast: What does Corbyn really think about Brexit?\n\nBrexit has become a divisive issue for Jeremy Corbyn and the Labour party.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the Labour party.

Since mid-January an organisation called Britain\u2019s Future has spent \u00a3125,000 on Facebook ads demanding a hard or no-deal Brexit. So who or what is Britain\u2019s Future? Sorry, I have no idea \u2013 it has no published address and releases no information about who founded it, who controls it and who has been paying for these advertisements.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest People\u2019s Vote campaigners record a social media message. Photograph: Gary Calton/The Observer\n\n\u201cThe anti-Brexit campaigns People\u2019s Vote and Best for Britain have also been spending heavily on Facebook ads. At least we know who is involved in these remain campaigns and where they are based, but both refuse to reveal their full sources of funding. So why won\u2019t the government act? Partly because, regardless of the corrosive impacts on public life, it wants to keep the system as it is. The current rules favour the parties with the most money to spend, which tends to mean the parties that appeal to the rich. But mostly, I think, it\u2019s because, like other governments, it has become institutionally incapable of responding to our emergencies. It won\u2019t rescue democracy because it can\u2019t. The system in which it is embedded seems destined to escalate rather than dampen disasters.\u201d\n\nSport\n\nOle Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r said Manchester United cannot afford to feel sorry for themselves after Paris Saint-Germain inflicted a first defeat of his caretaker tenure on a night when Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 showed off his repertoire of speed and skill. Joe Root says he stands by what he said to Shannon Gabriel and felt obliged to uphold his responsibilities after the West Indies fast bowler was charged for using abusive language following England\u2019s consolation win in the third Test.

    "description": "The president\u2019s El Paso rally should have been a tricky affair, with the wall, the shutdown, a counter-rally by local Democrat star Beto O\u2019Rourke. But it was a night of wild surprises At the end of Trump rallies, order breaks down and people are tired. To tho\u2026",
    "text": "At the end of Trump rallies, order breaks down and people are tired. To those seeking to shock, injure, annoy or make a point, it\u2019s go time. In El Paso, on the US\u2019s southern border, at Trump\u2019s first campaign-style rally of 2019, two people unfurled the flag of the Soviet Union.\n\nThis happened inside the El Paso County Coliseum. I was outside in the parking lot, with about seven thousand others, shivering in the frigid desert night. Inside, Trump was winding down his speech and people were leaving. Suddenly there was a commotion at the exit. A pair of young people wearing black were hurrying out of the building, holding the large Soviet flag, being chased by a pack \u2013 a posse \u2013 of cowboys. I have seen some curious things at Trump rallies, but none stranger than the sight of four cowboys running after two people carrying a giant red USSR flag, hammer and sickle and all, through a parking lot in El Paso.\n\nWhen I say cowboy I mean cowboy. Though we were deep in Texas, only a few in Trump\u2019s audience were wearing cowboy hats, or adhered in any way to our mental picture of a cowboy. But these four young men did. They were clean-shaven and short-haired, they wore cowboy hats and cowboy boots and snug unfaded Levis. They ran after the Soviet flag-bearers, trying to grab it and in that way \u2013 I presume \u2013 sap it of its awesome power. But the communist sympathisers were fast and crafty. They weaved through the crowd with alacrity, while the cowboys moved awkwardly, their cowboy boots a bit too stiff and their pants a bit too snug.\n\nA swarm of rally attendees followed the melee with their blue-lit phones. Soon a trio of police officers entered the picture. Two of them slowed the cowboys, allowing the communists to leave the parking lot. \u201cUSA! USA!\u201d the cowboys chanted to the disappearing flag-bearers, and much of the crowd joined in.\n\nIt was a spectacle at the end of a long night, and it briefly enlivened the crowd outside \u2013 who showed up too late to get a spot inside the warm Coliseum and thus had to watch Trump\u2019s speech on a giant screen in the cold. It was one of so many unexpected happenings that day in Texas, but at least cowboys v communists we can understand.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Into the Coliseum \u2026 Donald Trump and Beto O\u2019Rourke go head to head in El Paso. Composite: Getty\n\nThis was 11 February 2019. A week before, Trump had given his State of the Union address, in which he made his case for the wall and painted a dubious picture of El Paso as a lawless city, which had become safe and prosperous after a wall had been constructed in 2009, separating it from Mexico. Many El Pasoans, including Mayor Dee Margo, objected to this characterisation, citing statistics that disproved Trump\u2019s statements, but Trump did not correct himself and did not back down.\n\nInstead, he took his case to El Paso, a city that shares a vast symbiotic metropolitan area with Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez in Mexico and bills itself as the largest binational urban area in the world. El Paso\u2019s population is 80% Hispanic, and is considered a Democratic stronghold. The city\u2019s most famous politician is Beto O\u2019Rourke, the former congressman who unsuccessfully ran for Senate against Ted Cruz \u2013but in the process gained a national following and has been considered a viable candidate for president. O\u2019Rourke is young \u2013 46 \u2013 and eloquent, and has the kind of charisma that brings to mind JFK and RFK and Obama. With his thick salt-and-pepper hair and lanky athleticism, he looks like he\u2019s fallen from a bough of the Kennedy tree. He had decided to hold a counter-rally directly coinciding with Trump\u2019s speech.\n\nHow to explain the Trump supporters who held signs that read \u2018Finish the Wall\u2019, when Trump has not begun con\u00adstruc\u00adtion?\n\nIt was Trump\u2019s first rally since he was soundly defeated in the game of shutdown chicken he played with Nancy Pelosi in December and January. Holding a rally head-to-head with O\u2019Rourke, in O\u2019Rourke\u2019s backyard, after insulting the city of El Paso on national television, seemed like a very bad idea in every possible way. But Trump has always done the wrong thing and has usually been rewarded for it. So that we can explain.\n\nBut how to explain that about half of Trump\u2019s audience that night in El Paso were people of colour, most of them Latino? How to explain the fact that Trump attracted 15,000 supporters to his rally, while O\u2019Rourke garnered only 4,000 people to his event, held in his hometown, on the same evening? How to explain the thousands of Trump supporters who held signs \u2013 given to them when they entered the Coliseum \u2013 that read \u201cFinish the Wall\u201d, when Trump has not yet begun any construction on said wall? And how to explain the Trump campaign\u2019s decision to follow his speech with the Rolling Stones\u2019s \u201cYou Can\u2019t Always Get What You Want?\u201d\n\nEl Paso is a bustling city surrounded by desert, everywhere touched by white dust and bright sun. In the morning, I watched the area around the Coliseum, as early arrivals to the rally parked their cars. Their licence plates read Arizona, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, even Florida. One giant RV arrived bearing every flag made to celebrate Trump, Pence and the making great of America again. These fans, who started lining up at 9am for a rally scheduled to begin at 7pm, were the kinds of people we assume Trump attracts: that is, white people.\n\nThe Coliseum, less than a mile from the Mexico border, is near a working-class neighbourhood of small ranch houses, and many of them had opened their driveways and yards to attendees\u2019 cars, generally charging $10 for parking. As the day went on, I stood at the corner of Paisano and Shelter, where the rally-goers had to pass on their way to get in line outside the Coliseum, and the crowds arriving defied all expectations. There were Latino families. There were African Americans. There were biracial couples. Young South Asians and Pacific Islanders. About half of the people rushing to get in the long line that stretched far down Paisano were people of colour. A good third of them were under 30.\n\nAs I watched the line grow, I met two T-shirt vendors who had parked their carts, full of Trump hats, hoodies and pins, in the path of the attendees. Angel Gaudet and Skaheen Thompson, both from South Carolina, have been following Trump to his rallies since his 2016 campaign. Gaudet and Thompson don\u2019t work together, but have seen each other on the trail and consider themselves friendly competitors. And since Trump announced his candidacy, business has been good. Selling Trump gear \u2013 especially MAGA hats, which they say are by far the bestselling item \u2013 they can make as much as $2,300 in one day.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Trump supporters gather to attend his rally in El Paso, Texas. Photograph: Paul Ratje/AFP/Getty Images\n\nOver the past few years, they have become Trump supporters, but have nuanced views about him and his policies. \u201cI like that he makes it happen,\u201d Gaudet said. She is white, wore a pink hoodie and her hair was dyed green. She spoke with a drowsy, raspy drawl. \u201cHis mouth, his overall attitude, is fucked up,\u201d she continued, \u201chow he talks about people or to people sometimes. Sometimes I guess he gets caught up like anybody else. But overall he\u2019s like, \u2018If you ain\u2019t for us, then we ain\u2019t for you. Get the fuck on.\u2019 You know what I mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cI love that,\u201d said Thompson. \u201cHe\u2019s for America 100%. It\u2019s America or no way. I love that.\u201d Thompson is an African American man in his early 20s. He was wearing a camouflage shirt under black overalls, with a large pin on his chest depicting a cartoon boy \u2013 a mashup of Calvin from Calvin and Hobbes and Trump himself \u2013 urinating on the CNN logo.\n\nPeople continued to walk past us en route to the rally. Mothers and daughters in University of Texas-El Paso sweatshirts. A man wearing an Uncle Sam costume. Groups of young men and groups of young women, and couples holding hands and dressed up as if the rally were a night on the town. A middle-aged blond woman rushed by in a head-to\u2011toe suede outfit, fringes flying as she crossed the street, the lights of the Coliseum beckoning.\n\n\u201cI really think Trump can help put order in this world,\u201d Gaudet said. \u201cBecause right now it\u2019s just a mess. And I think he can do that because of his attitude. He just, he don\u2019t give a damn if the next person gets mad or not. As far as becoming a president and putting shit in order, I think he could be that dude to put shit in order.\u201d\n\nA man walked by wearing a sleeveless denim jacket with a rendering of a grim reaper on the back. The staff of the reaper\u2019s scythe was an AK-47, the blade an American flag. He stopped briefly to inspect the merchandise. I asked Gaudet and Thompson how, as self-employed entrepreneurs, they got their healthcare.\n\n\u201cRight now I don\u2019t even have healthcare,\u201d Thompson said.\n\n\u201cI go to the emergency room,\u201d Gaudet said, laughing.\n\n\u201cI just go to the emergency room,\u201d Thompson agreed.\n\nI asked if they would support higher taxes for millionaires if it meant that people like them would get free healthcare. Gaudet didn\u2019t hesitate. \u201cNo, because one day we might be the millionaires.\u201d\n\n***\n\nJust down the way from Gaudet and Thompson, a woman with long grey hair was standing alone holding a sign featuring a photo of Trump digitally manipulated so that he was wearing a giant sombrero. The words \u201cEl Mam\u00f3n\u201d \u2013 the closest English equivalent would be \u201ccocksucker\u201d \u2013 were printed in large letters below. She stood at the stoplight and was getting periodic honks and thumbs-up from cars passing by. Meanwhile most of those walking to the rally had to pass her, and she\u2019d gotten a long look at the strength and diversity of the audience, and she was surprised.\n\n\u201cI really am,\u201d she said. \u201cBut you know what? My sister, she\u2019s a Trump supporter. It got to the point where we don\u2019t talk to each other no more. I mean, you can\u2019t have a conversation.\u201d\n\nThis sister, she said, works for US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). And in the last few years, her sister has taken a harder line on all immigrants, who she considers a drain on the social safety net, taking benefits they are not entitled to.\n\n\u201cShe even has a thing against our mom! Our mom was born across the border, but she came over here and she got her citizenship. And Mom gets social security and they took some away from her, so my sister starts telling my mom, \u2018You see. That money they took away, they\u2019re giving it to these people coming over illegally.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe looked at the traffic coming down the road. I asked if her sister always had these feelings about her mother. \u201cNo, ever since Trump. Then she starts throwing it in our face, you know? For this past Thanksgiving, we didn\u2019t have Thanksgiving together. Isn\u2019t that sad?\u201d\n\nI asked the woman if I could have her name, but she declined. \u201cI work for the sheriff\u2019s office,\u201d she said.\n\n***\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Trump rally in El Paso in February 2019. Photograph: Joe Raedle/Getty Images\n\nThe woman with the El Mam\u00f3n sign was one of a very few visible protesters. Those opposed to Trump were assembling next to Bowie High School, about a mile away, with the intention of marching from there to the park, across the street from the Coliseum, where O\u2019Rourke was holding his counter-rally. The plan, though, left the Trump supporters largely unopposed by protesters, a rare state of affairs when a Trump rally happens.\n\nIn any case, there was a recording being broadcast into the Coliseum parking lot, advising Trump supporters on what to do if a protest were to break out during the rally. \u201cWhile we all have a right to free speech,\u201d a woman\u2019s voice said, with a chilling mixture of bright cheer and implied menace, \u201cthis is a private event, paid for and hosted by Donald J Trump for President, Inc. And you came to hear the president.\n\n\u201cSome individuals,\u201d she continued, \u201cmight try to disrupt our patriotic event. The president needs your help in maintaining a peaceful atmosphere at all times. If a protest starts near you, please do not, in any way, try to harm a protester. Please notify a law enforcement officer of the location of the protester by holding a rally sign over your head and chanting, \u2018Trump, Trump, Trump\u2019. Encourage those around you to do the same until officers can remove the protester from the rally.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re glad you\u2019re here for this special occasion with President Donald Trump. Thanks for helping us to make America great again.\u201d\n\nWhen her announcement was finished, the loudspeaker played Lynryd Skynryd\u2019s \u201cFree Bird.\u201d\n\n***\n\nThe incongruity of the music played at Trump rallies is one of the distinct pleasures of attending these events. There is a high likelihood that there is a prankster hiding inside the Trump campaign machinery, and this prankster has been put in charge of the playlist. At the first Trump rally I attended, in August 2016, the song played immediately after Trump finished his speech was Elton\u2019s John\u2019s \u201cTiny Dancer\u201d. Trump had recently made the size of his hands (and presumably, his feet) a campaign issue, so the choice of \u201cTiny Dancer\u201d could not have been accidental in a day that had otherwise been planned down to the minute. I had admired that DJ greatly and am sure that she or he is still on the job, for the musical choices played before and after Trump rallies still makes no conceivable sense unless it\u2019s understood as a wry commentary. Never is there simple country music, or music by anyone who actually supports Trump. Instead, the music is meant to make us think.\n\nThis day in El Paso, as the attendees filed into the Coliseum, a 30-minute mix of songs, instructions and archival recordings played in a loop, the juxtapositions evidence of the same prankster\u2019s wit. There was a lot of Queen and again, Elton John. \u201cFree Bird\u201d was followed closely by the Village People\u2019s \u201cMacho Man\u201d. Shortly thereafter there was a recording of a newscast from the night of the 2016 election, wherein the newscaster counted the electoral votes and declared Trump the winner. This itself was strange enough, coming two years after the election. Stranger still, that this recording was followed by the Rolling Stones\u2019 \u201cSympathy for the Devil\u201d.\n\n***\n\nIn El Paso, nothing was more unexpected than the startling diversity of the crowd that came out\n\nAnother crucial benefit of going to these rallies is that nothing is as you would expect. Everything is richer, stranger, full of relentless complexity. In August 2017 I went to a rally in Phoenix where the anti-Trump protesters equalled the Trump fans, and among these protesters were 24 members of the John Brown Gun Club, an armed progressive militia who that day were carrying loaded AR-15s. That was surprising.\n\nToday in El Paso, nothing was more unexpected than the startling diversity of the crowd that came out. Two men were sitting in front of the Salvation Army depot, watching the proceedings as they would a parade. Mando Ramirez, 68, was from the farming town of Fabens, Texas, his face showing the deep tan-lines of a life spent in the sun. Daniel Gonzalez, born and raised in El Paso, was a college student with soft features and an easy smile. The two men had just met. They both considered themselves politically independent.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s practising the democratic process,\u201d Gonzalez said about Trump. Gonzalez had considered attending the rally just to hear what Trump had to say. He appreciated Trump\u2019s willingness to try novel policies, even with the wall \u2013 not that Gonzalez thought the wall was a solution. \u201cWe do need some policy for it, but walls are not gonna stop anything. We\u2019re gonna build tunnels, build ladders, airplanes, trampolines. It doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf anybody\u2019s gonna run against Trump, they better bring something to the game,\u201d Ramirez said. He felt there were two primary issues for 2020. One was the economy. \u201cThe other,\u201d he said, \u201cis keeping our country strong against Korea and them assholes, people like that. I like that about Trump. No matter what a president does, somebody\u2019s always gonna disagree. We needed somebody like Trump. We were getting weaker and weaker.\u201d\n\nI asked Ramirez if he felt Trump had done all he\u2019d promised. \u201cYeah, I mean, he can\u2019t do everything,\u201d he said.\n\n***\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Illustration: S\u00e9bastien Thibault\n\nBeto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s rally was scheduled to start at seven o\u2019clock. First there would be the march. At about four o\u2019clock, O\u2019Rourke was standing near a grandstand, talking to a few people. He was surrounded by cameras. A few minutes later, he walked across the park holding the hands of two young children, backlit by the golden light of a setting sun. A half-dozen aides and cameras preceded him, capturing the moment.\n\nNearby, a woman was holding a box of plastic battery-powered candles, and offered me one. She said her name was Tracy Sias. She\u2019d driven all the way from Tucson to be at the O\u2019Rourke rally. \u201cI came here to give him\u201d \u2013 she gestured toward Trump\u2019s rally \u2013 \u201cand all of them, the finger. Simple as that.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019d asked her best friend to come with her, but her friend said that if she came, she\u2019d be on the other side of the street, at the Trump rally.\n\n\u201cMy jaw dropped!\u201d Sias said. She was loud and funny and cursed like a sailor. \u201cShe\u2019s my BFF, my friend since the womb. Our mothers were pregnant at the same time.\u201d She and her friend had grown up in Massachusetts. \u201cI\u2019m an original Masshole,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been friends for ever, 50-odd years. She knitted me a pink pussy hat last year for the women\u2019s march!\u201d But then something had changed. Her friend had recently moved to South Padre Island.\n\n\u201cLiving down there with all those rednecks? It\u2019s right outside Brownsville, you know, right on the border. Now she wants to build a wall, or lock \u2019em out, or whatever shit they say. She gets so angry!\u201d\n\nThere were two button badges on her jacket. One was a pro-gun rights badge \u2013 \u201cI like guns,\u201d she said. \u201cI got no problem with guns\u201d \u2013 and the other was a Build the Wall badge. \u201cI got this for my BFF as a joke,\u201d Sias said. \u201cI took a picture and told her, \u2018I love you. Even though you\u2019re an asshole.\u2019\u201d\n\n***\n\nIt was getting bitterly cold, so I ran back to my car to get another coat. In the neighbourhood where I had parked, an African American Trump merchandise vendor was wheeling his cart through the narrow streets, going home.\n\n\u201cFuck Trump!\u201d a man yelled.\n\nIt was unclear where the voice was coming from.\n\n\u201cFuck Trump!\u201d the man yelled again.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t have to tell me!\u201d the vendor yelled back, and kept going.\n\nThe voice was coming from a large man standing in his front yard. He was about six foot two and sturdily built. He wore a black tank top featuring a photo of a woman in a white tank top. The upper row of his teeth were capped in silver. Though he\u2019d been yelling \u201cFuck Trump\u201d seconds ago, when we began talking he was softly spoken and ended most of his sentences with the word \u201csir\u201d.\n\nThe man\u2019s name was Adrian Saenz and he\u2019d been born and raised in El Paso. He was a truck driver, primarily delivering furniture in El Paso and across the border in Mexico. He lived in the neighbourhood near the Coliseum and had seen no difference in safety before and after the walls had gone up.\n\nTrump Jr has the same arrogant charisma as his father. He worked the crowd masterfully\n\n\u201cEl Paso\u2019s always been a safe city, sir,\u201d he said. But he didn\u2019t think a wall would have any effect on illegal immigration. \u201cHonestly, sir, in this neighbourhood, there\u2019s about three, four houses full of illegal aliens. And I\u2019m talking about full. And that wall ain\u2019t doing shit. If you were to be here on a daily basis and just stand at the border, you would see people jumping that wall like nothing.\n\n\u201cYou could go downtown, sir, and those small businesses that are selling candy and stuff, you open up a little tunnel and people cross all day there. I mean, the statements that he\u2019s making are just to his advantage, sir.\u201d\n\nBut he didn\u2019t consider Trump a racist.\n\n\u201cBeing Mexican, I was born here, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s racist. A lot of people want to jump on that real quick, but he has hired a lot of Mexicans, sir. Most of the people that built his projects are Mexican. In Manhattan, a lot of Latinos were hired. I mean, he\u2019s a smart man. His dad loaned him a million dollars, and he became a billionaire. You know what I mean?\n\n\u201cHonestly, the thing I like about Trump \u2026 I mean, I hate him. It\u2019s like a yes and a no, you know what I mean? I wouldn\u2019t mind if he was president again, because he doesn\u2019t give a damn, because we need someone in office who puts down their foot. The only thing I don\u2019t like is that asylum stuff. My family paid for people to come over the border legally.\u201d Saenz objected to members of the caravan, for example, who might get asylum simply by showing up at the border. \u201cFrom one Latino to another Latino, everyone just wants to get a bite of the pie. But there\u2019s a right way to do it. They shouldn\u2019t get benefits by coming that way.\u201d\n\nAs we were talking, a loud roar came from the direction of the Coliseum. Senator Ted Cruz had just been introduced.\n\n***\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Trump Jr at the El Paso rally. Photograph: Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThat Cruz would garner a rousing ovation from thousands of people shivering outside on a cold El Paso night defied all presumptions. But the crowd cheered loudly for him, and as I walked back to the Coliseum parking lot, I heard his disembodied voice introduce an idea that is, perhaps, one of the more diabolically brilliant pieces of political propaganda conjured in some time. Trump needs to be re-elected, Cruz said, because he \u201cneeds time to finish the wall\u201d.\n\nThis was the first time this idea was introduced, the idea that the wall did not need to be begun. It did not need to be built. It needed to be finished. When I got to the Coliseum parking lot Cruz was speaking on the big screen, and all around him Trump fans were holding signs they\u2019d been given when they entered the building. These signs read \u201cFinish the Wall\u201d. The layers were dizzying. On the campaign trail in 2016, Trump had promised to build a wall and compel Mexico to pay for it. He\u2019d built five samples of the proposed wall in the San Diego desert. And yet in two years of Republican rule of Congress, Trump had not begun building the wall. After the Democrats took the House of Representatives in 2018, Trump decided it was the time to build the wall, and shut down the government for 35 days, hoping that the closure of the federal government would convince Pelosi and the House to give him $5.7 bn dollars to build the wall. This did not happen. To date, no new wall construction has begun anywhere along the southern border. And yet, a few days after this El Paso rally, Trump would have to make a decision whether he would again shut down the government, or else accept a compromise brokered by congressional leaders. The number being floated was $1.3 bn, which the Democrats were willing to give in exchange for various concessions.\n\nAnd though this deal was not done, and again, no wall construction had begun anywhere, the Trump campaign tonight had introduced the idea of finishing the wall they had not begun constructing. And conveniently, in the hazy world of Trump\u2019s facts and numbers, the $1.3 bn he was likely to get from Congress appeared to be enough to finish the project. The missing $4.4 bn no longer mattered. It did not matter, either, that none of the wall that he\u2019d promised had been erected. Or that Mexico would not pay for it. Or that any wall that did get built would not look like the concrete curtain he had originally envisioned. Now, Trump\u2019s audience was happily participating in a real-time revision of reality, one in which the wall was just \u2026 about \u2026 done.\n\nTed Cruz finished his brief speech and introduced Donald Trump \u2013 the crowd roared at those two words \u2013 Jr. There was momentary deflation but then real enthusiasm as Trump Jr appeared to Neil Young\u2019s \u201cRockin\u2019 in the Free World\u201d, a song most assuredly not authorised to be played at a Trump rally. Now sporting a beard, Trump Jr mentioned that he had just been in Texas a week before, on a hunting trip with friends. The crowd loved it. He denigrated socialism and the crowd loved it. His stage presence and comfort behind the microphone were remarkable, and portend trouble for those opposed to all that Trumpism represents, for it\u2019s obvious that Trump Jr could run for office in Texas, and many other states, and win. He would trounce Cruz or John Cornyn in a primary. He is young, he shoots guns, kills animals, and has the same arrogant charisma as his father. He worked the crowd masterfully and, unlike his father, he is concise and disciplined on stage. Those worried about a Trump dynasty continuing with Ivanka should look beyond her to Donald Trump Jr. He has said and tweeted countless xenophobic and plainly ignorant things but, unlike his sister, he leans into controversy, not away from it. He has fire in his belly and seems to be enjoying his notoriety more every day.\n\nIn his short speech, he mentioned that America was good, that the American flag was good, that freedom was good and that guns were good. He gloated about the comparative size of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s rally \u2013 which he said was tiny \u2013 and ceded the microphone to his father.\n\n***\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest O\u2019Rourke takes selfies with supporters at the El Paso rally. Photograph: Christ Chavez/Getty Images\n\nA few hundred feet away, at the O\u2019Rourke event, people were still streaming in to the fenced-off park. A stage had been set up and a band had just finished playing. O\u2019Rourke took the microphone wearing a light-blue button-down, his shirtsleeves rolled up to the elbow. The audience was diverse in every way. There were college students, families, ageing hippies, and overall a very high women-to-men ratio. They held placards that read \u201cEl Paso Is Safe/Trump Is Not\u201d and \u201cWe Shall Overcome His Combover\u201d.\n\nThere was scattered talk about whether or not the giant inflatable chicken with the face and hair of Trump would make an appearance, but it was nowhere to be seen. In the middle of the audience, two young people in black hoodies held up a paper mache facsimile of Trump, dangling by the neck from a rope.\n\nThough O\u2019Rourke spoke beautifully, the verdict of the night had already been made, and he had lost\n\nWhen O\u2019Rourke spoke, he was eloquent and passionate about American immigration and the unique ways that El Paso has historically coexisted with Mexico. There was no teleprompter visible, no notes, no podium even, and yet he strung together sentences startling in their lyricism. He noted the little known but remarkable fact that the border cities of the US, San Diego and El Paso among them, are among the safest large cities in the country \u2013 safer than interior cities such as Chicago, Detroit and St Louis. \u201cEl Paso,\u201d he said, \u201chas been the safest city in the United States of America, not in spite of the fact that we are a city of immigrants, but because we are a city of immigrants.\u201d\n\nPeriodically he translated his own speech into Spanish, and though he spoke beautifully to a rapt audience, and though his case was utterly convincing, the verdict of the night had already been made, and O\u2019Rourke had lost. Across the street, Trump had come to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s backyard and had attracted a crowd at least four times larger. And when O\u2019Rourke was finished, and his audience had left the field, Trump was still going strong at the Coliseum.\n\n***\n\nI ran from the O\u2019Rourke event back to the Trump rally, and before I got to the Coliseum parking lot, I caught Trump saying \u201cRemember, it\u2019s America first!\u201d to huge applause. The cheering lasted as long as it took me to get from the far end of the parking lot to up close to the screen, after which another \u201cUSA! USA!\u201d chant had broken out.\n\n\u201cOur agenda is not a partisan agenda,\u201d he continued, \u201calthough some people say that it is. It\u2019s a mainstream, common-sense agenda of the American people.\u201d I could see him on the giant screen, with about 5,000 people surrounding it. Most were wearing red MAGA hats, giving the scene an eerie Minion-like aura. It was cultish and a bit ominous from afar, but as I got closer, the scene grew far more casual. There were food trucks, and the lines to get burritos and churros were long. People milled about, checked their phones and looked for friends.\n\nThere is virtually nothing Trump won\u2019t say, so when he\u2019s off-script, there\u2019s no way to stop watching once you begin\n\nFor a while I stood near a Latino family of seven. There were two men in their late 30s, their wives, three kids between them, and a grandmother. They watched the bright screen bearing Trump\u2019s face and leaned into each other. As people left around them, they became an island in the parking lot, refusing to budge. One of the men had a habit of repeating the last word of key Trump phrases, or yelling his approval when Trump asked for it. When Trump said child smuggling was immoral, he said: \u201cHell yeah!\u201d When Trump said sanctuary cities were immoral, he yelled: \u201cRight on!\u201d\n\nThe man cheered when Trump mentioned a new Rasmussen poll had declared that his approval rating was 52%. \u201cFifty-two percent!\u201d Trump said. \u201cExplain that,\u201d he continued. \u201cHow do you get that when you don\u2019t get good press?\u201d He said 93% of the stories written about him were negative. \u201cNo matter what we do, they figure out a way to make it bad.\u201d\n\nHis speech was, like all his speeches, mesmerising. There is virtually nothing he won\u2019t say, so when he\u2019s off-script, there\u2019s no way to stop watching once you begin. He touted the fact that he\u2019d not only freed prisoners from North Korea, but that he\u2019d brought back remains. \u201cRemains are coming back. Remains!\u201d He did not say whose remains had come back. He went into great detail about third-term abortions, and told the audience that Democrats advocated the killing of babies after their birth. At that, the crowd booed louder than at anything all night. He praised law enforcement officers, in particular those working for ICE, and then said that hi-tech tools were fine in the fight against illegal immigration, but \u201cthere\u2019s nothing better than a German shepherd\u201d.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The US-Mexico border fence seen from Playas de Tijuana, Baja California Photograph: Guillermo Arias/AFP/Getty Images\n\nAnd as ludicrous as these fragments seem out of context, watching the speech with what truly was an everyday and diverse group of people, I had the distinct impression that Trump could easily be re-elected. Recent polls had found that fully 58% of the American electorate had vowed to vote for anyone but Trump, but even with all the insanities of his speech, and the unending chaos of his first two years in office, he laid out a compelling case that night for having achieved actual results that actually mattered to his fans, both the passive and the devout. He mentioned that unemployment for Hispanic workers was at a historic low, and this is true. He mentioned that unemployment for African American workers was at an all-time low, too, and this is also true. We in the media have long seen Trump as a racist buffoon and a threat to every core democratic principle, but his supporters see him as a man who gets things done, who speaks candidly, and who has engineered an economic boom that is the envy of the world. Almost invariably, his fans acknowledge his crude way with words, and his difficulty telling the strict truth, but they consider these minor sins dwarfed by the impact of a thriving economy, the winding down of two unnecessary wars, and a tough-minded stance against China, North Korea and illegal immigration. To his supporters, even the casual ones, he has a lot to run on. And even those who are agnostic about Trump, at least here in El Paso, were conceding his successes.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel that he gets credit for what actually works,\u201d Eddie Avila said. Avila was 22, and had come to the rally \u201cjust to scout it out\u201d. He\u2019d put on a sweater to cover his Mexican national soccer team jersey. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to get jumped,\u201d he said.\n\nAvila didn\u2019t vote for Trump, and didn\u2019t vote for Hillary Clinton, either. But he\u2019d been impressed with some of Trump\u2019s progress. I asked for an example.\n\n\u201cMoney. Work,\u201d Avila said. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing what he\u2019s done to improve employment in the United States. I was working for Toys R Us and unfortunately the company closed. Not because of Trump or anything. I was stressing out, but it didn\u2019t take me long to find a job.\u201d He was now a supervisor at Barnes and Noble.\n\nThen again, Avila said, \u201cHe just wants to do some weird stuff. This whole wall-building is just a waste of time. Half my family comes from Mexico, and it\u2019s not going to stop anything. The guys who have been doing this\u201d \u2013 meaning those who transport people and goods illegally over the border \u2013 \u201chave been doing this before Trump was born.\u201d\n\nI asked Avila if he was surprised at both the large turnout at the rally, and the diversity of the audience.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in shock,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were not expecting it.\u201d On the other hand, he said, \u201chalf the people here, they don\u2019t know what the hell is going on. They\u2019re just here because Trump is here.\u201d\n\n***\n\nThere comes a point in Trump rallies when only the most diehard fans stay engaged, and usually this comes when Trump begins to read from pieces of paper. In this case, at a little after 8pm, he began thanking the local politicians who had come to the rally, from Texas governor Greg Abbott to the state\u2019s secretary of agriculture. By the time he got to the local members of Congress, there was a flood heading for their cars.\n\nThe cowboys v communists moment happened, and by the time Trump finished speaking, the crowd outside was down to about a thousand people. I joined the current of humanity leaving the Coliseum, and as we all crossed Paisano, I talked with two Kenyan men. They were dressed in sports jackets and were rushing through the cold night, police lights flashing in their faces. They said they were medical students, and supported Trump \u201cfrom the start\u201d. I asked why. \u201cBecause he\u2019s strong!\u201d one of the men said. I asked them if they thought Trump was a racist. After all, he\u2019d reportedly lamented that so many immigrants were trying to come to the US from \u201cshithole countries\u201d, and included African nations within that group. \u201cHe\u2019s not a racist,\u201d one of the men said. \u201cHe\u2019s a businessman!\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk to him,\u201d the other Kenyan said, referring to me. \u201cHe\u2019s from the liberal media.\u201d And they laughed and picked up their pace.\n\n***\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Anti-Trump marchers in El Paso, near Trump\u2019s rally. Photograph: Paul Ratje/AFP/Getty Images\n\nBack at the corner of Paisano and Shelter, where hours before I\u2019d met the T-shirt vendors and the woman holding the El Mam\u00f3n sign, the first real confrontation between Trump supporters and detractors was taking place. An African American man in short dreadlocks was holding a large, handmade \u201cBeto 2020\u201d sign. This provoked much consternation from the passing Trump fans. \u201cGood luck with that!\u201d they yelled. \u201cTrump! Trump! Trump!\u201d someone yelled, seemingly obeying the recorded directive from before the rally. Some simply held up their \u201cFinish the Wall\u201d signs, and kept walking. There was a phalanx of police officers in riot gear, standing between the protesters and the rallygoers, accompanied by an armoured vehicle. A woman\u2019s voice from inside the vehicle came through a loudspeaker and plaintively and constantly asked for order. \u201cKeep it moving. Keep it civil!\u201d she implored.\n\n\u201cLock up Trump!\u201d a protester yelled.\n\n\u201cLosers!\u201d a Trump rallygoer yelled. \u201cTrump won. Get over it!\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not throw anything,\u201d the police voice said.\n\n\u201cLatinas for Trump!\u201d a woman in red sang as she walked by, holding up a Trump placard.\n\n\u201cNo respect for racists!\u201d a protester yelled.\n\n\u201cYou need to leave this corner now,\u201d the police voice said, now sounding more worried. \u201cThat is a lawful order.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can I be a racist if I\u2019m Latino?\u201d he asked her. \u201cI\u2019ve got a brother in the army! I\u2019m supporting my president!\u201d\n\nThere were only about 40 people standing on the corner \u2013 as anti-Trump protests go, it was small and ineffective. And not all of the people on the corner were against Trump. A third of the assembled were actually Trump supporters embedded with the protesters, hassling them, and a third were curious observers and oddballs. One man was standing against a fence, listlessly saying \u201cHey hey, ho ho, Donald Trump has got to go,\u201d at a volume only he and someone standing next to him might hear. Another man was insisting that everyone should subscribe to PewDiePie\u2019s YouTube channel.\n\n\u201cCrowd needs to disperse. Leave this corner now,\u201d the police voice said.\n\n\u201cWe all need to go home and subscribe to PewDiePie!\u201d the man said.\n\nAmong the protesters were five women dressed in black who were calling out Latinos emerging from the Trump rally.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re supporting a man and a system that oppresses you!\u201d one of the protesters said to a young man with the name Rios on the back of his sweatsuit top.\n\n\u201cHow can I be a racist if I\u2019m Latino?\u201d he asked her. \u201cI\u2019ve got a brother in the army! I\u2019m supporting my president!\u201d he yelled, his voice breaking.\n\nHe was with three friends, all young men, and for a while they and the women protesting yelled at each other and no minds were changed. Nearby, though, a man and a woman were engaged in a heated but not uncivil debate. He was white, about 30, wearing a baseball cap with sunglasses resting on the peak. She was Latina, a bit older than him, shorter but not backing down \u2013 her name was Pearl Crain. Their discussion was so reasonable and substantive that a crowd of about 12 people had formed around them. One of the protesters nearby was so disarmed by the man, a veteran who called himself \u201cJustin from Tucson\u201d, that he invited Justin from Tucson to come out for tacos.\n\n\u201cHe just went to a Trump rally and now he\u2019s going for tacos,\u201d Crain said with a laugh.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not incongruous at all,\u201d Justin from Tucson said. \u201cNot only do I love Mexican people and any kind of Latin American culture, but I have a lot of friends from all kinds of ethnicities.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen how can you go to that rally?\u201d Crain asked.\n\n\u201cWhy am I at the rally? Because I really do believe that Trump is the president for the people.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the president for you. For white people,\u201d a man in the scrum said.\n\nJustin turned quickly on him. \u201cYou\u2019re making a lot of accusations, brother. Are you judging me by the colour of my skin, or by the content of my character?\u201d he asked, quoting Martin Luther King. The man backed off.\n\n\u201cI know he makes stuff up. I know he exaggerates,\u201d Justin from Tucson said. \u201cWhat president hasn\u2019t?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis one\u2019s a liar. A cheat,\u201d Crain said.\n\n\u201cPewDiePie does not support violence!\u201d the oddball yelled from somewhere in the dark.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re giving you a lawful order. Leave this corner now,\u201d the police voice pleaded.\n\n\u201cMy encouragement to people who think we\u2019re all a bunch of deplorables,\u201d Justin from Tucson said to Pearl, \u201cis to reach out and have conversations. Good night.\u201d And he was gone, following the last of the Trump supporters going to their cars.\n\nCrain got ready to go, too. And just when the night seemed to have ended on a somewhat graceful note, a man coming from the rally ran toward the few remaining protesters, with his fingers in the shape of a pistol.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got a gun!\u201d the man yelled, pretending to shoot the man holding the Beto 2020 sign. The man with the finger-gun was white, about 60, wearing a MAGA hat and ironed jeans. He looked like a dentist from a television commercial. Then he jogged down the street, backwards, giving the finger to everyone on the corner, as we all stood speechless in the dark\n\n\u2022 Dave Eggers\u2019s new novel, The Parade, will be published on 21 March by Hamish Hamilton.

    "text": "Top story: Legal battle looms over \u2018desperate\u2019 measure\n\nGood morning, it\u2019s Warren Murray getting you off to a running start.\n\nDonald Trump is moving to declare a national emergency in an attempt to build his wall on the border with Mexico. Democrats are drawing constitutional battle lines over what they have called a \u201cdesperate\u201d abuse of presidential powers.\n\nOvernight the US Congress passed a spending bill to avert another government shutdown \u2013 it includes $1.375bn for 55 miles of new border fencing, far less than the $5.7bn Trump sought for a concrete or steel wall. The bill will go before Trump today. \u201cPresident Trump will sign the government funding bill,\u201d said a White House statement, \u201cand as he has stated before, he will also take other executive action \u2013 including a national emergency.\u201d That could involve trying to mobilise the military to build the wall.\n\nNancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House, has said she will consider a legal challenge to the emergency declaration, and there are questions over whether, and how, it could ultimately be used to build the wall.\n\n\u2018They don\u2019t compromise, they never have\u2019 \u2013 Theresa May has been defeated in the Commons by hardline Brexiters of the European Research Group (ERG), who refused to vote to endorse her EU negotiating strategy. Remain-minded Tories were furious after the vote and said the PM should sideline the ERG by seeking agreement across the House rather than trying to please Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s grouping. A cabinet source said: \u201cOnce again the ERG have made life hell for the prime minister and put their own fantasies in the way of pragmatic politics.\u201d The ERG sided against May because, it said, she was trying to take a no-deal Brexit off the table. The rebellion marks the end of a temporary truce over Brexit among Conservative MPs, who had voted last month to endorse May\u2019s strategy to try and obtain concessions on the Irish border backstop.\n\n\u2018Beginning of great changes\u2019 \u2013 The school climate strike comes to the UK today.

At the turn of the 20th century, when many were acquired (Puerto Rico, the Philippines, Guam, American Samoa, Hawaii, Wake), their status was clear. They were, as Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson unabashedly called them, colonies.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A true map of the United States and its territories would look more like this. Illustration: Guardian Design\n\nThat forthright imperialism didn\u2019t last. Within a decade or two, the c-word became taboo. \u201cThe word colony must not be used to express the relationship which exists between our government and its dependent peoples,\u201d an official admonished in 1914. Better to stick with a gentler term, used for them all: territories. Today\u2019s typical mental map is a union of states bounded by the Atlantic, the Pacific, Mexico and Canada \u2013 possibly with the addition of Alaska and Hawaii.

    "title": "Trump's national emergency declaration is a 'slap in the face to military families'",
    "description": "Carlos Barria/Reuters President Donald Trump's national-emergency declaration will allow him to tap military construction funds to pay for a border wall. Lawmakers have pledged to fight Trump's declaration in court. But Trump's move to siphon money away from \u2026",
    "text": "Trump Declares National Emergency in \u2018Slap in the Face to Military Families\u2019\n\nPresident Donald Trump\u2019s plan to declare a national emergency will divert $3.6 billion earmarked for U.S. military construction projects\u2014possibly hospitals and infrastructure improvements\u2014to fund a portion of his long-promised wall along the southern border, a move that experts say is an affront to military families.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be signing a national emergency,\u201d Trump said Feb. 15 in remarks in the Rose Garden. \u201cIt has been signed many times before \u2026 for far less important things in some cases, in many cases. We are talking about an invasion of our country with drugs, with human traffickers, with all types of criminals and gangs.\u201d\n\nIn total, Trump will have access to roughly $8 billion that can be used to secure the southern border, said acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney in a call with reporters ahead of the president\u2019s remarks.\n\nThe announcement, which came as the president also planned to sign into law a government spending bill to avoid a second government shutdown, comes just days after a Senate Armed Services subcommittee held a marathon hearing on the deplorable state of some military housing.\n\nDuring the hearing, military families described in shocking detail living in crumbling homes, and lawmakers expressed outrage at the allegations of \u201cunacceptable\u201d conditions of privately managed housing. On the same day, a group released a survey of living conditions at U.S. bases that described black mold, lead paint, infestations, flooding, and more.\n\n\u201cHaving the president declare a national emergency in order to use [military construction] funding just days after a horrible SASC hearing on the terrible state of privatized military housing is a slap in the face to military families,\u201d said Loren DeJonge Schulman of the Center for a New American Security. \u201cThe trade-off may not be direct\u2014it\u2019s not clear what the funding might have otherwise done\u2014but it\u2019s an ugly symbol of priorities.\u201d\n\nTrump will use a legal provision that allows the president to redirect unobligated military construction funds\u2014money that has been appropriated by Congress and set aside for specific projects but not yet issued\u2014in the event of a war or national emergency.\n\nIn addition to the $3.6 billion in military construction funds, the White House has identified $1.375 billion in the appropriations bill the president plans to sign to avert the shutdown, $600 million from the Treasury Department\u2019s forfeiture funds, and roughly $2.5 billion from Pentagon funding for counterdrug activities, some of which will be reprogrammed from other Defense Department accounts, Mulvaney said.\n\nCongressional aides said as of Feb. 14 the Defense Department had just $800 million in its counterdrug coffers.\n\nTrump previously asked Congress for $5.7 billion this year to build the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\u201cWe think this is something that will give us the necessary funding to be able to execute the wall in a timely manner,\u201d Mulvaney said.\n\nThe use of the emergency provision is problematic in many ways, experts say. The $3.6 billion, which could be taken from construction projects such as hospitals, family housing, and maintenance, would not be replenished until Congress passes another defense appropriations bill, according to two congressional aides speaking on condition of anonymity. This could leave critical infrastructure improvements in limbo. It is still unclear which projects the money would come from, the aides said.\n\nA senior administration official said the projects under consideration are \u201clower priority\u201d efforts, for instance ones that \u201cmight be able to wait a couple of months into next year.\u201d He noted that the $3.6 billion is \u201cjust a small fraction\u201d of the entire military construction fund.\n\n\u201cWe are going through a filter to ensure that nothing impacts lethality, readiness on the part of the military construction budget.\u201d\n\nThe official said the White House plans to replenish this money back to military construction as part of the fiscal year 2020 budget it will submit to Congress in March.\n\n\u201cThe verdict is currently out on how this will affect military families, but coming so soon after a hearing on military housing conditions it certainly highlights one of the many potential problems with trying to shift money allocated for one thing by Congress and moving it to something else,\u201d said Andrew Boyle, who works as counsel for the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice.\n\nThere are also legal question marks surrounding the president\u2019s invocation of a national emergency. DeJonge Schulman said that any such declaration \u201cwill almost certainly be tied up in litigation right away.\u201d One wrinkle in particular that will invite a legal challenge: The provision requires that funds taken from construction money be used in support of the armed forces.\n\n\u201cThere will be legitimate question about whether building a fence along the border is in support of the armed forces,\u201d one congressional aide said. \u201cThat would be worked out in court.\u201d\n\nTrump declaring a national emergency could also prompt a political response. House Democrats are mulling a joint resolution to nullify the declaration\u2014one that would force Senate Republicans to vote on a politically divisive issue.\n\nAt any event, invoking a national emergency outside of war or high-profile disasters like the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks sets a troubling precedent, DeJonge Schulman said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) hinted that a future Democratic president could similarly use the emergency measure to implement sweeping changes in national policy without going through Congress.\n\nFor example, one statute would allow the president to suspend rules prohibiting the testing of biological and chemical weapons on unwitting people, Boyle said. Another would allow the president to shut down or take over radio stations. Still another allows the government to freeze the assets of people\u2014including Americans\u2014and prohibit them from engaging in any type of financial transactions in which a foreign national has an interest.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s concerning when any powers intended for emergency use are used in nonemergency situations in order to avoid the check of congressional legislation and power of the purse on executive action,\u201d Boyle said.\n\nHowever, Mulvaney pushed back on the concern that the move creates a potentially dangerous precedent.\n\n\u201cIt actually creates zero precedent,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is authority given to the president in law already, it\u2019s not as if he just didn\u2019t get what he wanted so he\u2019s waving a magic wand and taking a bunch of money.\u201d",

    "text": "RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) \u2014 A Republican operative, who last year rounded up votes for a GOP candidate running for Congress, conducted an illegal and well-funded ballot-harvesting operation, North Carolina's elections director said on Monday.\n\nThe director's testimony came on the first day of a hearing into whether mail-in ballots were tampered with a in race for the state's 9th congressional district seat that saw Republican Mark Harris narrowly defeat Democrat Dan McCready.\n\nThe race wasn't certified, leaving the country's only congressional election without a declared winner. The elections board is expected to either declare a winner or order a new election after the hearing.\n\n\"The evidence that we will provide today will show that a coordinated, unlawful and substantially resourced absentee ballot scheme operated in the 2018 general election\" in rural Bladen and Robeson counties, which are part of North Carolina's 9th congressional district, state elections director Kim Strach said at the start of a state elections board hearing.\n\nHarris held a slim lead over Democrat Dan McCready in unofficial results following November's election, but the state elections board refused to certify the contest after allegations of potential ballot manipulation surfaced.\n\nAn investigation targeted a political operative working for Harris' campaign named Leslie McCrae Dowless Jr . He paid local people he recruited $125 for every 50 mail-in ballots they collected in Bladen and Robeson counties and turned in to him, Strach said. That means they could have been altered before being counted.\n\nThe operation's scope allowed Dowless to collect nearly $84,000 in consulting fees over five months leading into last year's general election, said Strach, adding that in addition to reviewing financial and phone records investigators questioned 142 voters in the south-central North Carolina counties.\n\nMark Harris listens to the public evidentiary hearing on the 9th Congressional District investigation Monday, Feb. 18, 2019, at the North Carolina State Bar in Raleigh, N.C. Juli Leonard/The News & Observer via AP, Pool\n\nDowless was hired to produce votes for Harris and Bladen County Sheriff Jim McVickers, but his methods last year included paying people to visit potential voters who had received absentee ballots and getting them to hand over those ballots, whether completed or not, Dowless worker Lisa Britt testified.\n\nIt's illegal in North Carolina for anyone other than a guardian or close family member to handle a voter's ballot.\n\nBritt testified she sometimes completed unfinished ballots and handed them to Dowless, who kept them at his home and office for days or longer before they were turned in, said Britt, whose mother was formerly married to Dowless.\n\nRead more: Several Democratic candidates are spending Presidents Day campaigning in New Hampshire and Iowa\n\nWhile the congressional and sheriff's races were almost always marked by voters who turned in unsealed ballots, Britt said she would fill in down-ballot local races \u2014 favoring Republicans \u2014 to prevent local elections board workers from suspecting Dowless' activities.\n\nWhile Dowless and Harris' main campaign consultant were in constant contact, she didn't have any indication Harris knew about the operation, Britt said.\n\n\"I think Mr. Harris was completely clueless as to what was going on,\" Britt said.\n\nLisa Britt answers a question by executive director of the Board of Elections Kim Strach during the public evidentiary hearing on the 9th Congressional District investigation Monday, Feb. 18, 2019, at the North Carolina State Bar in Raleigh, N.C. Juli Leonard/The News & Observer via AP, Pool\n\nHarris received 679 mail-in ballots in Bladen and Robeson counties, compared to 652 for McCready, Strach said. But McCready's lawyers contend nearly 1,200 other mail-in ballots were sent to voters and never returned \u2014 enough to erase Harris' 905-vote lead after Election Day.\n\nStrach was expected to touch on the unreturned ballots later in the hearing lasting at least until Tuesday.\n\n\"It's not just about those that have been returned. It's potentially about those that haven't been returned,\" she said.\n\nDowless and Harris attended Monday's hearing. McCready did not.\n\nFour of the five members on the elections board \u2014 composed of three Democrats and two Republicans \u2014 would need to agree a new election is necessary.\n\nIf that doesn't happen, McCready's lawyers said state officials should send their findings to the Democrat-dominated US House and let it decide whether Harris should be seated \u2014 arguing that the US Constitution gives the House authority over the elections and qualifications of its members.\n\n___\n\nFollow Emery P.

    "description": "The recent partial government shutdown delayed preparations for the 2020 head count, including for a field test of the controversial citizenship question, internal Census Bureau documents suggest.",
    "text": "2020 Census Preparations Were Slowed By The Partial Government Shutdown\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Claire Harbage/NPR Claire Harbage/NPR\n\nWhile parts of the federal government ground to a halt for 35 days during the shutdown, Census Bureau officials have insisted that work on the upcoming 2020 census continued.\n\nPreparations for the constitutionally mandated head count were at \"at full capacity\" and were \"uninterrupted\" from Dec. 22, 2018, through Jan. 25, the Census Bureau has said, because of close to $1 billion in carryover funding from last year.\n\nBut newly released internal documents suggest that the furloughing of federal workers during the shutdown interrupted some 2020 census operations, including preparations for the bureau's first-ever field test of a controversial question about U.S. citizenship status on a 2020 census form.\n\nStarting in June, about a half million households are set to receive one of two test census forms similar to the questionnaire the bureau is planning to use next year. The question \"Is this person a citizen of the United States?\" will be included on some of the forms.\n\nThe test is designed to piggyback off of the response systems used for the American Community Survey. That's an ongoing Census Bureau survey that goes out to about one in 38 households every year.\n\nWhile workers for the 2020 census were funded during the shutdown, bureau employees who work on the American Community Survey, or ACS, were furloughed for more than a month.\n\n\"Due to the government shutdown the ACS operational systems are not being updated,\" Census Bureau officials wrote on the \"Risks and Current Issues\" page of a Jan. 15 slide deck prepared to update Deputy Secretary of Commerce Karen Dunn Kelley about the field test.\n\n\"When the furlough ends and ACS operations resume, staff resources will be diverted to restart the ACS,\" the officials continued on the same page, noting that some staffers were \"encouraged to work ahead\" on the field test for the citizenship question \"in anticipation of the competing priorities.\"\n\nThe NAACP and its local affiliates in Connecticut and Boston provided NPR with the documents. They were released to the NAACP earlier this month by the Commerce Department, which oversees the Census Bureau, as part of the settlement of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed in 2017 by the civil rights groups, which were represented by the Yale Law School Rule of Law Clinic.\n\nIn an email, a spokesperson for the bureau, Michael Cook, declined to \"extensively comment on draft or internal briefing documents that are out of context.\"\n\n\"No operational delivery milestones were affected and there was no impact to cost and/or scale of the 2020 Census operations because of staff furloughs during the partial lapse in appropriations,\" Cook said in a written statement. \"The recent partial government shutdown did not result in any change that impacted the schedule, cost, or scale of 2020 Census operations.\"\n\nAnother internal slide deck from January, however, notes that, as of Jan. 22, the furloughing of bureau employees who work on iCADE \u2014 a system for capturing data from handwritten responses on paper questionnaires for the census \u2014 was \"beginning to impact operational delivery milestones.\"\n\n\"At this time it is unknown as to whether the impact can be mitigated,\" Census Bureau officials wrote for a presentation prepared for Kelley on Jan. 30.\n\nUnderstaffing and underfunding\n\nThe NAACP has raised concerns about understaffing and inadequate funding for the census. Funding approved by lawmakers for fiscal year 2017, for example, did not match the levels the bureau has said it would need.\n\n\"We were already concerned even before the government shutdown occurred,\" says Khyla D. Craine, assistant general counsel for the NAACP. \"This is just another way of showing how the unnecessary government shutdown has impacted something that is so crucial.\"\n\nIn a separate lawsuit led by the civil rights group, a federal judge in Maryland ruled in January that the NAACP's claim that the 2020 census is underfunded can move forward.\n\nEarlier this month, President Trump signed a fiscal year 2019 spending bill that gives the Census Bureau $1 billion more than it was allocated last year.\n\nPast funding shortfalls have forced the bureau to scale back its other field tests for the 2020 census. The only test run of the upcoming head count conducted last year in Rhode Island's Providence County rolled out without a full advertising campaign and more quietly than the bureau originally planned.\n\nSome census advocates are concerned that, without a test ad campaign, the bureau is not fully prepared to conduct outreach to communities of color, immigrants and other hard-to-count groups during the 2020 census.\n\nA newly released internal Commerce Department document reveals that some inside the government had similar concerns.\n\n\"By missing the opportunity to test a full advertising campaign in the 2018 End-to-End Census Test, the advertising strategy for the 2020 Census would be untested and unproven on a population whose media consumption habits have changed dramatically since the last decennial census cycle,\" wrote Commerce Department official Michael Anderson in the internal document from 2016. The paper analyzed the impact on the census of proposed funding levels from Congress and the White House during the Obama administration.\n\nAnderson added that not being able to \"refine\" the campaign through testing \"could lead to weakness in targeted advertising to specific hard-to-count population groups \u2014 again resulting in more costs for in-person visits and less accurate counts of these population groups.\"\n\nThe Commerce Department's public affairs office did not respond to NPR's request for comment about the 2016 document.\n\nAsked whether Anderson's assessment represents the Census Bureau's position on not having an advertising campaign for last year's census test run, Cook \u2014 the bureau's spokesperson \u2014 emphasized in a written statement that the 2020 census advertising campaign is \"informed by the most robust foundational research, to date, to support a decennial census communications campaign.\"\n\n\"We will continue to conduct substantial research to inform the direction of our creative approach throughout the campaign to motivate individuals to respond to the 2020 Census, especially among those communities with historically low response rates,\" he wrote.",

Richard Shelby, Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee told Fox News Sunday he put the odds of a deal at 50-50. \"I think the next 24 hours are crucial. We could close some deals, but they've got to be good, to secure our borders,\" Shelby said.\n\nA Democratic congressional aide tells NPR talks have broken down over how many detention beds for Immigration and Customs Enforcement will be funded through the agreement. Democrats want to limit the number of beds to force the Trump administration to prioritize arresting and deporting serious criminals, not law-abiding immigrants.\n\nPresident Trump has asked for $5.7 billion to fund a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. On Sunday Trump tweeted that Democrats \"are offering very little money for the desperately needed Border Wall & now, out of the blue, want a cap on convicted violent felons to be held in detention!\"\n\nAccording to The New York Times, \"While Democrats refused to entertain the prospect of fulfilling Mr. Trump's $5.7 billion demand for a border wall, lawmakers had grown closer to accepting a number between $1.3 billion and $2 billion for physical barriers. But they also demanded the limit on ICE beds, as a way to force the agency to focus on detaining migrants with criminal records instead of people who have overstayed their visas.\"\n\nPolitico reports, \"Lawmakers are discussing the possibility of a year-long continuing resolution bill but so far discussions have not led to a proposal that both House Democrats and Senate Republicans could get on board with.\"\n\nActing White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney told NBC's Meet the Press that negotiations are \"all over the map because of the Democrats\" and that \"the White House, at the request of all the parties on the Hill, have sort of stepped back. We're still participating, we're still listening, we're still talking, but we're not leading the negotiations.\"\n\nWhen asked about funding for a border wall, Mulvaney said he \"absolutely cannot\" rule out another government shutdown.

    "text": "Trump To Declare National Emergency As Well As Sign Spending Bill, White House Says\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Guillermo Arias/AFP/Getty Images Guillermo Arias/AFP/Getty Images\n\nUpdated at 9:14 p.m. ET\n\nPresident Trump will support a border security funding compromise, averting a partial government shutdown early Saturday \u2014 but he also will declare a national emergency in order to build the wall he has pushed for along the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n\"President Trump will sign the government funding bill, and as he has stated before, he will also take other executive action \u2014 including a national emergency \u2014 to ensure we stop the national security and humanitarian crisis at the border,\" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement. \"The President is once again delivering on his promise to build the wall, protect the border, and secure our great country.\"\n\nBy Thursday evening, Congress had easily passed the bipartisan spending deal, which had been crafted by lawmakers from both the chambers. The vote was 83-16 in the Senate and 300-128 in the House, constituting veto-proof majorities.\n\nWhile the president's decision removes the threat of another partial shutdown, it also raises the stakes in his push for a trademark border wall right as the 2020 presidential campaign is heating up. Trump's move to pursue additional funding for the wall through the declaration of a national emergency is an extraordinary and unprecedented possible use of presidential power \u2014 and one almost certain to elicit efforts to limit the executive branch's expansive authority over what constitutes such an emergency and how one is to be handled.\n\nTrump had seemed somewhat hesitant to sign the breakthrough deal that congressional negotiators reached in the wake of a previous 35-day shutdown, the longest ever in U.S. history. The proposal only includes $1.375 billion for border barriers and increases other border security funding \u2014 far short of the $5.7 billion Trump had demanded to make his signature campaign promise a reality. Many influential conservatives balked at that figure, which is what triggered Trump to back off an earlier similar funding offer in December that led to the partial shutdown.\n\nBut now he will go along with the offer \u2014 by adding his own controversial terms. For some time, Trump has floated the idea of declaring a national emergency to secure the funding he desires, and it's an idea that Democrats and many within the GOP have cautioned him against, both for the potential precedent it would set and legal challenges it almost certainly will face.\n\nIn a joint statement, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said an emergency declaration \"would be a lawless act, a gross abuse of the power of the presidency and a desperate attempt to distract from the fact that President Trump broke his core promise to have Mexico pay for his wall.\"\n\n\"It is yet another demonstration of President Trump's naked contempt for the rule of law. This is not an emergency, and the president's fearmongering doesn't make it one. He couldn't convince Mexico, the American people or their elected representatives to pay for his ineffective and expensive wall, so now he's trying an end-run around Congress in a desperate attempt to put taxpayers on the hook for it. The Congress will defend our constitutional authorities,\" the Democratic leaders said.\n\nNational Security How Trump Might Get Additional Funding For A Border Wall How Trump Might Get Additional Funding For A Border Wall Listen \u00b7 3:35 3:35\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., was the first to make the announcement Thursday afternoon that Trump would back the legislative package. McConnell also said he would endorse the president's plan to declare a national emergency, even though the top Senate Republican seemed to previously warn against such a maneuver.\n\n\"And he \u2014 I would say to all my colleagues that he has indicated he's prepared to sign the bill. He will also be issuing a national emergency declaration at the same time. And I've indicated to him that I'm going to support the national emergency declaration,\" McConnell said on the Senate floor.\n\nThe $333 billion bipartisan spending package also funds a number of unrelated agencies that have become part of the overall spending fight. The bill also has restrictions on where the fencing can be built, including explicit protections for sites like a butterfly refuge in the Rio Grande Valley.\n\nMcConnell and other top Republicans had urged Trump to sign it, with Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the longest-serving Republican in the Senate, even invoking a high power after the daily morning prayer on Thursday.\n\n\"Let's all pray that the president will have wisdom to sign the bill so government doesn't shut down,\" Grassley said before leading the chamber in the Pledge of Allegiance.\n\nAt first, Democrats had celebrated the legislation as a victory over Trump's demand for $5.7 billion to build more than 200 miles of concrete wall along the U.S. border with Mexico. The final agreement includes a fraction of that funding for steel fencing that is similar to existing barriers elsewhere on the border. However, that victory was short-lived with the news of the emergency declaration, which Democrats have already indicated they would challenge in court.\n\n\"I don't believe there's any good faith negotiations to have with Republicans if they're going to support the president doing an end run around Congress,\" Pelosi said in a press conference shortly after McConnell's remarks in the Senate.\n\n\"So the precedent that the president is setting here is something that should be met with great unease and dismay by the Republicans, and of course we will respond when we review our options,\" Pelosi said, adding that \"Republicans should have some dismay about the door that they are opening, the threshold they are crossing.\"\n\nCalifornia Attorney General Xavier Becerra said earlier this month in his Spanish-language response to the State of the Union that he would sue the Trump administration the moment the president declares a national emergency to free up funds for a border wall.\n\n\"Any crisis on our border is of President Trump's own making: family separations, child detention, turning our backs on asylum seekers, and more. There is no national emergency. If Trump oversteps his authority and abandons negotiations with Congress by declaring a fabricated national emergency, we won't only call his bluff, we will do what we must to hold him accountable,\" Becerra said in a statement Thursday. \"No one is above the law.\"\n\nThere could also be a way Democrats in Congress could seek to invalidate any emergency declaration.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, Sanders dismissed any possible legal challenges to the emergency declaration.\n\n\"We are very prepared but there shouldn't be [any challenges],\" the White House press secretary said. \"The president's doing his job. Congress should do theirs.\"\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a Trump ally, said in a statement that this was the right move from the president.\n\n\"The budget deal is a down payment on the wall, provides funding for more immigration judges, and does not include a cap on detention beds for violent illegal immigrant offenders,\" Graham said. \"It's now time for President Trump to use executive power, including declaring national emergency, to build the wall.\"\n\n\"I've heard the arguments that it will be the end of Western order, and I don't believe that. I've heard the arguments that it sets a precedent, as if future presidents wouldn't be smart enough to know they have this option. The president isn't exercising any power that Congress didn't give him,\" said Sen. John Kennedy, R-La. \"I don't know how he is going to structure it. It may be there will have to be a vote of Congress. Almost surely someone will try to tie it up in court.\"\n\nPolitics Chairman Of American Conservative Union Discusses Border Security Deal Chairman Of American Conservative Union Discusses Border Security Deal Listen \u00b7 5:35 5:35\n\nOther senators, however, sounded more skeptical.\n\n\"My concerns about an emergency declaration were the precedent it would establish,\" said Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas. \"I also thought it would not be a practical solution because there would be a lawsuit filed immediately and the money would presumably be balled up associated with that litigation. I thought there were other, better alternatives.\"\n\n\"I generally don't think that's a good approach but we'll have to deal with it and see what can be done about it,\" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said of the impending national emergency declaration. \"But again I want to see what he actually does.\"\n\n\"In general I'm not for using emergency powers because I think the Constitution is very clear at very \u2014 trying to separate the powers. And if we start naming things as emergency, very quickly we lose things \u2014 sort of the checks and balances of government,\" said libertarian-leaning Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky.\n\nThe homeland security funding bill would also reduce the number of immigration detention beds from roughly 49,060 to roughly 40,000 over the course of a year. Detention beds became a major issue in the negotiations after Democrats sought to curb aggressive immigration enforcement in exchange for more overall spending on border security.\n\nThe legislation also includes a number of funding changes for programs ranging from border security to energy and environment. It includes $9.3 billion for the Environmental Protection Agency and the Land and Water Conservation Fund, $17 billion in new infrastructure funding, a $1.8 billion spending increase for the 2020 census and a 1.9 percent pay raise for federal workers.\n\nHowever, negotiators were unable to agree on a number of priorities they hoped to add on to the spending bill. Talks broke down over a measure to provide back pay for federal contractors who missed paychecks during the last shutdown, according to several aides familiar with the talks.\n\nThat failure forced them to abandon all unrelated policies, like funding for disaster aid and an extension of the Violence Against Women Act.\n\nLeaders plan to try to address those issues separately, and grants under the Violence Against Women Act will continue to be funded, according to several leadership aides.",

Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nHouse Democrats plan to file a resolution Friday seeking to block President Trump's emergency declaration aimed at securing funds for building a border wall.\n\nThe \"resolution of disapproval,\" led by Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, received the backing of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in a letter Wednesday to lawmakers in both parties.\n\n\"I write to invite all Members of Congress to cosponsor Congressman Joaquin Castro's privileged resolution to terminate this emergency declaration,\" Pelosi wrote, adding that the House will \"move swiftly to pass this bill.\"\n\n\"The President's decision to go outside the bounds of the law to try to get what he failed to achieve in the constitutional legislative process violates the Constitution and must be terminated,\" she added.\n\nThe president issued his emergency declaration after Congress failed to approve his demand for $5.7 billion to build a wall along the southwest border as part of the annual Homeland Security spending bill. A stalemate over the issue caused a partial government shutdown earlier this year.\n\nThe shutdown ended when Trump signed a spending bill allocating $1.375 billion for border fencing. The emergency declaration would allow him to divert an additional $6.7 billion in funds from other government projects to the border wall.\n\nSixteen states, led by California, have filed a lawsuit arguing that \"the President has used the pretext of a manufactured 'crisis' of unlawful immigration to declare a national emergency.\" The states say Trump's action is unconstitutional because only Congress, not the president, has the authority to control spending.\n\nApproval of the resolution is widely expected in the Democratic-controlled House. A vote by the full House is expected in mid-March. If the House passes the resolution, then the GOP-controlled Senate would be required to take it up.\n\nIt is not yet clear whether there are sufficient numbers of Republicans senators who would join Democrats in approving the resolution. One moderate, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said she would support the resolution. But with the Republicans holding a 53-47 majority in the Senate, three other Republicans would have to join Collins for the resolution to have a chance at passage.\n\nOther Republican senators have expressed their displeasure with the emergency declaration and some face tough re-election fights so they might risk bucking the president on the unpopular border wall.\n\nHowever, even if the House and Senate voted to approve the resolution, reaching a threshold of a two-thirds majority in each chamber in order to override a presidential veto is not likely.",

    "text": "The Historic Chapel At The Heart Of A Legal Fight Over The Border Wall\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Dana Cronin/NPR Dana Cronin/NPR\n\nBefore sunrise and illuminated by lantern light, the faithful gathered to pray, as they have many times before, at La Lomita chapel in Mission, Texas.\n\nThe chapel is made of simple white adobe, and Roy Rogers' song \"Blue Shadows On The Trail\" plays from a battery-operated radio in the chilly pre-dawn gloom as Rev. Roy Snipes makes his way down the aisle to preside over the Mass.\n\nThe choice of processional music is an unusual one, but this congregation expects it. Father Snipes is known around here as the cowboy priest. He normally wears his wide-brimmed hat, and on the altar with him are two of his rescue dogs.\n\nOn Friday, his prayers are politically pointed.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Dana Cronin/NPR Dana Cronin/NPR\n\nHe intones, \"Oh Lord, you made our hearts and you know us and you know our affliction and our astonishment at the arrogance of our own government desecrating the sanctuary of our homeland ... ignoring our rights as free Americans and sons and daughters of Texas, South Texas. We pray to you.\"\n\nThe local Catholic diocese is mired in a legal battle with the U.S. government over the chapel's land, which is right next to the Rio Grande River. 25 miles of President Trump's proposed border wall, funded in 2018 when Republicans still held a majority in the House, are slated to go through Hidalgo County, where Mission is located.\n\nLa Lomita \u2014 which means little hill \u2014 has been here almost since the southern border was created, following the Mexican-American War in the mid-19th century. It's part of a series of missions established by the Catholic Church to maintain a presence on the U.S. side of the new border. The town of Mission \u2014 now with a population of around 80 thousand people \u2014 grew up around it.\n\nIn last year's appropriations bill, money was allocated for \"levee fencing\" on the land at La Lomita \u2013 a massive 30-foot wall on the north side of the property, complete with access roads and cameras. After the Mass, Snipes says he believes a wall will desecrate this place. Those who came to pray here agree.\n\nThe Mass ends outside the chapel with a hymn in Spanish, and the congregation gathers around a bonfire amid the twisted mesquite trees.\n\nRene Villarreal is a 51-year-old electrical contractor and a father of five sons. He says this is more than just a spiritual place. Generations have prayed here.\n\nReligion Texas Chapel In Path Of Trump's Proposed Border Wall Texas Chapel In Path Of Trump's Proposed Border Wall Listen \u00b7 5:40 5:40\n\n\"I mean you're here in the mornings,\" Villarreal says. \"And you just wonder how many of your ancestors have been here praying for the same things we're praying, and asking our God to help us and give us the strength to go through another day.\"\n\nLike many residents here, he has deep roots on both sides of the border. People here switch easily between Spanish and English: The town of Mission is in Hidalgo County which is 92 percent Latino, and many of the residents have family in Mexico.\n\n\"Well, look around,\" says Armando O'Ca\u00f1a, mayor of Mission, who attended the service. \"Look at people just eating breakfast here... under some of these trees here in this nice park here in Mission. You know. There's nothing unusual. You know it's normal. It's a normal event. So there's no crisis here on the border.\"\n\nIt was the same message he delivered to President Trump when he met him last month during Trump's border visit. O'Ca\u00f1a says once the wall is built, it will cut off access to city services, like 911, for Mission's residents on the other side.\n\n\"That's not right,\" he says. \"How can I protect them? How can we get even water and sewer on the other side? Yeah, they say they will have some gates and all that, but you know when seconds count, you still have to go through the gate.\"\n\nThe latest legal battle over the land between the government and La Lomita took place last week. The local diocese tried and failed to stop the government from surveying the chapel land.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Dana Cronin/NPR Dana Cronin/NPR\n\nMary McCord is a senior litigator at Georgetown Law's Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection, and she's one of the lawyers representing the diocese. She says the government has the right to claim private property for public use \u2014 but La Lomita is a chapel, not just private land.\n\n\"What's different about this,\" she says, \"Is that government can't take action that substantially burdens the free exercise of religion and that is not only part of the First Amendment, but it's also part of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\"\n\nShe says the church argues that the wall is inconsistent with Catholic teachings, \"which includes this principle of universality that all people are equal and need to be treated as such, and provided with basic necessities of life. Whether it's food and shelter... and according to the teachings of the pope migration is an important piece of this.\"\n\nThe next court battle will be over the government's plan to actually seize the land and start building.\n\nDriving down the proposed path of the border wall, there's an RV park where Texans come to enjoy the warmth in the winter. There's also a riverside restaurant and a lot of farms and houses. It's peaceful. But there's also the constant presence of Customs and Border Protection, with watchtowers and helicopters, as well as sensors dotting the river bank.\n\nThe area encapsulates the debate over border security \u2014 specifically, what kind does this part of Texas need?\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Monika Evstatieva /NPR Monika Evstatieva /NPR\n\nFor businessman Monty Awbrey, the answer is clear.\n\n\"Our national security is at risk,\" he says. He runs his construction business from his ranch, where he also raises horses and cattle.\n\nHe also met with President Trump when he was down here last month. And he made quite the impression.\n\n\"When I asked President Trump to sign my name tag,\" he says, \"I asked him, you know, would be OK if I gave him a gift. And he said yes, and I just kind of reached out and started undoing my belt.\"\n\nImagine the scene: Monty Awbrey, a really big guy, digging around his pants in front of the president.\n\n\"Everybody kind of lost their head like whoa. And [Trump] looked at me like, what are you doing?\" he recounts, laughing.\n\nHe was actually going for his rodeo championship buckle, which reminds him of his late father. He wanted Trump's son Barron to have it.\n\nIt's no surprise Awbrey was invited, since he's a vocal supporter of the president's signature campaign promise.\n\nLast month, he threw a barbecue for border patrol agents working without pay during the shutdown.\n\n\"Each one of those agents I got to meet, I shook their hands and talked to them, thanked them for their service, and I asked them their opinion of the wall,\" he says. \"Out of all those 250 agents, not one of them was against it.\"\n\nHe believes walls work.\n\n\"It is a humanitarian crisis,\" he says. \"Whether the mayors or local law enforcement want to say so. They're not in the rural areas out here. They don't see what goes on, on a day to day basis. ... They've never had [migrants] walk up on their doorstep at three in the morning begging for help.\"\n\nAfter his meeting with the President, Awbrey says he got a lot of hate on social media, where he was called a racist. He says those labels don't work on the border. His wife is Latina and he speaks fluent Spanish. And he's friends with Father Snipes \u2014 he was even baptized at La Lomita six months ago, when he became a Catholic at his wife's request.\n\n\"Father Roy [Snipes] and I discussed this,\" Awbrey says. \"And he knows what side I stand on and he understands my views and I understand his as well. You know Father Roy is a very compassionate man. I love him to death and I'll do anything in the world for him.\"\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Monika Evstatieva/NPR Monika Evstatieva/NPR\n\nIt's the border way, Awbrey says. You can stand on different sides of an issue and still respect each other.\n\nCustoms and Border Protection declined to comment for this story. They did confirm that no work has begun yet on the Mission section of the border wall.\n\nBack at La Lomita chapel, the post-Mass meal is winding down. And 72-year-old Leonor Ochoa is sitting at the table enjoying the food and company.\n\n\"We live in a neighborhood where everyone shares,\" she says. \"Like right now, in this moment, we're a lot of different families, and all of us are coming together and sharing our tacos, and our lunch. We are united.\"\n\nShe says wall or no wall, that won't change.\n\nNPR's Francesca Paris produced this story for Digital.",

    "description": "In an extremely rare rebuke, a government ethics watchdog refused to certify Ross' recent financial disclosure. But he's still in office even as other Trump officials have resigned for ethical lapses.",
    "text": "'Not In Compliance': Wilbur Ross, The Trump Official Who Keeps Watchdogs Up At Night\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Alex Wong/Getty Images Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nThis story is published in partnership with The Center for Public Integrity\n\nRich businessman Wilbur Ross' promise to divest millions of dollars' worth of assets upon becoming Commerce Department secretary drew warm praise in 2017, even from Democrats.\n\nAt Ross' confirmation hearing, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, made a point of contrasting Ross' commitment to divest with the president's own decision to hold on to his business.\n\nBut two years later, Ross' string of financial disclosure inaccuracies is drawing condemnation instead of hosannas.\n\n\"I feel that essentially, he misled the committee, and a lot of my colleagues relied on those at best misleading, potentially outright deceptive\" representations, Blumenthal said in an interview this month.\n\nEven a member of the Republican Senate leadership, John Thune of South Dakota, has called for an investigation into whether Ross placed the public's interest ahead of his own.\n\nBut Ross, 81, continues to serve as commerce secretary without sanction even as Cabinet officials all around him have been felled by their ethical foibles. The saga showcases the weaknesses of a government ethics system that has long relied on political pressure as an enforcement mechanism and wasn't designed to police billionaires.\n\nRoss failed to divest assets when he said he would \u2014 despite telling ethics officials he had done so. His inaccuracies and omissions have also prompted serious questions about whether he took official actions that could affect his personal financial interests, which would violate conflict of interest law \u2014 something he has repeatedly said he hasn't done.\n\nRoss has acknowledged mistakes in his personal financial disclosures. One of his assets, a tranche of stock in investment management firm Invesco Ltd. worth between $10 million and $50 million, went up in value by seven figures during his delay divesting it, a previous Center for Public Integrity investigation found.\n\nIn a rare rebuke of a Cabinet-level official, the executive branch's ethics watchdog last week refused to certify Ross' 2018 personal financial disclosure report, which he first filed last August. Emory Rounds, the director of the Office of Government Ethics, said he would not certify it because Ross had inaccurately reported divesting BankUnited stock he in fact did not sell until October 2018. Ross' acknowledgement that he had failed to divest the stock when he said he had was first reported by the Center for Public Integrity in December. The commerce secretary \"was therefore not in compliance with his ethics agreement,\" Rounds wrote.\n\nRoss declined an interview for this article. In a statement provided via the Commerce Department before the Office of Government Ethics declined to certify his report, Ross said: \"I continue to follow the guidance of Department of Commerce ethics officials to ensure compliance with federal laws and regulations. I rectified errors once I discovered them. I remain committed to the American people and will continue to seek the guidance of ethics officials.\"\n\nAfter the OGE decision, he said in a separate statement that he was \"disappointed\" his report was not certified and that he remains \"committed to complying with my ethics agreement and adhering to the guidance of Commerce ethics officials.\"\n\nRoss is far from the only high-level Trump appointee whose personal finances and conduct have drawn scrutiny. In fact, compared with other Trump administration ethics scandals \u2014 abuse of government travel budgets, accepting improper gifts, requesting a Chick-fil-A franchise for a spouse \u2014 Ross' disclosure problems may seem arcane or obscure. His tone-deaf public statements during the shutdown drew more attention than his ethical lapses \u2014 and prompted a Saturday Night Live parody.\n\nBut Ross, it turns out, is the Trump appointee who keeps ethics watchdogs up at night.\n\n\"This record by Ross and by others of multiple misstatements on ethics forms I think demonstrates what kind of commitment to ethics this administration has, which is, essentially, contempt,\" said Kathleen Clark, a professor of government ethics law at Washington University in St. Louis.\n\nRoss' ethics issues carry echoes of Trump's own. Both have complex, opaque financial assets that are impossible to fully understand based on information in the public record. Both have come under fire for failing to divest their assets. Both have been accused of acting in their own interests, rather than those of the public.\n\n\"He has escaped sort of the more popular scrutiny because they're kind of sophisticated violations and they're a little bit wonky in terms of what the actual issue is,\" said Delaney Marsco, ethics counsel at the Campaign Legal Center, a nonprofit watchdog that filed a 115-page complaint against Ross last summer. \"But that makes them even more serious. ... This is a pattern of impropriety.\"\n\nMarsco and others say that after two years, they are still unable to confirm from public disclosure filings whether Ross has cleanly parted ways with all the assets he promised to divest.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nSix months ago, after a particularly biting scolding from government ethics officials, Ross said that \"to maintain the public trust,\" he would sell all his equity holdings and place the proceeds into U.S. Treasury securities. At the end of November, he disclosed the sale of some assets. Ross came into office as a member of Trump's own gilded tribe, billed as a billionaire business titan who earned Trump's respect when he helped him wiggle out of an ugly mess in Atlantic City, N.J., more than a quarter-century ago.\n\nClark, the law professor, said she is struck by the similarities between Ross and Trump. Said Marsco: \"The tone from the top has been, 'I'm not going to disclose my tax returns. I'm not going to divest from my company. I'm going to hire my relatives.' And of course other folks are going to do the same things. Why not? Where's the consequences?\"\n\nThe White House referred a question about what Ross' case says about the administration's commitment to ethics to the Commerce Department.\n\nIn response to a question about whether Ross' ethics issues have raised concern at the White House about his performance as commerce secretary, spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said, \"Secretary Wilbur Ross has been an advocate of the President's agenda and played a key role in growing our economy. Under Secretary Ross' leadership, the Department of Commerce has flourished.\"\n\nMembers of Congress have asked the inspector general of the Commerce Department, as well as the Department of Justice, to investigate Ross. Ross is scheduled to testify before the House Committee on Oversight and Reform next month and could be asked about his personal financial disclosure issues.\n\nHow did Ross get to this point?\n\nEven at his confirmation hearing, Ross' decision to hold on to his investments in transoceanic shipping prompted questions.\n\nBut ethics officials didn't require him to divest, and Ross at the hearing said the shipping assets didn't raise any issues. \"The research we've done suggests that there has never been a shipping case come before the Department of Commerce,\" Ross said, adding, \"I intend to be quite scrupulous about recusal [anytime] there is the slightest scintilla of doubt.\"\n\nIn March 2017, an investigation by the Center for Public Integrity found that Ross' stake in Diamond S Shipping raised complex conflict of interest concerns, given Ross' muscular role in the administration's trade policy. Most of the company's fleet sails under Chinese flags, and the company has ties to a major Chinese investment firm.\n\nLater that year, The New York Times and International Consortium of Investigative Journalists reported that a Russian energy company, Sibur, was a major client of another Ross shipping holding, Navigator Holdings, and that Russian President Vladimir Putin's then-son-in-law was a member of Sibur's board. Some ethics experts said his ownership of shipping interests potentially presented conflicts for his involvement in trade policy. In November 2017, Ross said he had sold his stakes in both Diamond S and Navigator.\n\nMeanwhile, questions about Ross' financials \u2014 and mistakes by Ross \u2014 continued to pile up.\n\nForbes' reporting raised questions about Ross' net worth and whether he had told the truth about his assets. Ross acknowledged transferring some assets into a trust to benefit his family, but he gave conflicting accounts of the timing of the transfers. Then, in a series of filings with ethics officials, Ross acknowledged that he had failed to divest assets he had promised to shed upon becoming commerce secretary until months after he was supposed to have done so.\n\nIn one such case, involving $10 million to $50 million worth of stock in Invesco Ltd., the stock rose in value by seven figures during the delay. In other cases, he said he sold some stock short, a move government ethics officials later blasted as apparently \"an ineffective attempt to remedy your actual or apparent failure to timely divest assets.\"\n\nThe failures raised questions about conflicts of interest, ethics watchdogs charge. For example, Invesco has investments in Chinese steel, and in 2017, Ross led an investigation to determine whether the U.S. should impose tariffs on Chinese steel. At the time, he still held the Invesco stock.\n\nThe Commerce Department has said Ross has kept his pledge to recuse with regard to Invesco, and as of July, no matter concerning Invesco had come up. Ross has repeatedly said the series of inaccuracies and omissions were inadvertent and maintains he hasn't violated conflict of interest law.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Amr Alfiky/NPR Amr Alfiky/NPR\n\nHis assertions haven't been enough to satisfy lawmakers.\n\n\"The breadth and the brazenness of his ethical lapses are just staggering,\" said Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who serves as ranking member of the powerful Senate Finance Committee. Wyden has called for a Department of Justice investigation into Ross. In a July letter, David J. Apol, then acting head of the Office of Government Ethics, the agency charged with monitoring ethics for the executive branch, sent Ross a sharply worded letter \"to express my concern regarding how recent actions on your part may have negatively affected the public trust.\"\n\nIn his letter, Apol bluntly warned Ross to \"devote the resources necessary to ensure that your report and all future communications with OGE are complete and accurate.\"\n\nDespite the warning, Ross failed to do so: He filed a financial disclosure form in August but has since corrected it to acknowledge he reported divesting BankUnited stock he had continued to own. The Commerce Department subsequently stressed it was only 100 shares of stock worth about $3,700 \u2014 a tiny fraction of Ross' net worth, and too small an amount to disqualify him from working on related matters. Nonetheless, it forced him to acknowledge another inaccuracy.\n\nRoss' improper reporting of the BankUnited divestiture was the last straw for federal ethics officials. In a letter explaining why he wouldn't certify Ross' 2018 report, Rounds pointed out that OGE in its July warning to Ross \"noted that even inadvertent errors could undermine the public's trust.\"\n\nBut OGE lacks enforcement authority, leaving it with few tools beyond a public scolding and the ability to refer potential investigations to entities such as the inspector general at Commerce or the Department of Justice.\n\nAfter Apol sent his letter last summer, then-Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Thune asked the Commerce inspector general to look into whether Ross had violated conflict of interest laws. Thune, who no longer serves as committee chairman, declined to be interviewed. The inspector general's office does not comment on pending matters.\n\nFormer ethics officials and watchdogs say there is no real precedent for the errors and omissions in Ross' disclosure filings.\n\n\"There seems to be a continuing pattern of either mistakes or deceptions or lies,\" said Marilyn Glynn, who was general counsel of the Office of Government Ethics, as well as acting director during part of the George W. Bush administration. \"For a guy whose business is managing money and investing money, he's awfully sloppy, and a million red lights are going off that there is something odd here.\" Said Don Fox, also a former general counsel and acting director of OGE: \"I haven't seen anything that approaches this. It's certainly incredibly careless the way that he has approached compliance with his ethics agreement.\"\n\nRoss isn't the only Cabinet member whose forms have not yet been certified: Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin submitted his on time in May, but OGE has yet to OK them. It isn't clear what is causing the delay in that case, and a Treasury spokeswoman said Mnuchin is working with OGE to have it certified.\n\nOGE has also yet to certify and publicly post two 2018 transaction reports filed by Mnuchin, showing he invested between $1.1 million and $5.25 million in a limited liability company, North Park I. Public information about North Park I is scant, though records show it was created in Delaware in August. In response to questions from the Center for Public Integrity and NPR, a Treasury spokeswoman said it is a \"personal non-investment asset owned 100 percent\" by Mnuchin. She did not directly respond to questions about what the LLC owns.\n\nQuestions about Ross' divestitures\n\nRoss' original financial disclosure form may have won praise, but it was also impenetrable \u2014 57 pages, including six pages of endnotes that were supposed to explain complexities, such as the underlying holdings of different business entities.\n\nRoss is not the first billionaire commerce secretary to have problems. His predecessor in the Obama administration, Penny Pritzker, had to amend her financial disclosure forms before her confirmation because she had understated her income by tens of millions of dollars. She also drew fire in connection with offshore tax havens.\n\nThe disclosure forms are designed for average people entering government service, said Jack Blum, a Washington lawyer and former Senate staffer who is an expert in tax evasion and money laundering. They are \"not for people who have holdings in dozens of companies which own, in turn, other companies, which have financial statements that are obscure as hell because they're all private so people can't figure anything out,\" Blum said.\n\nWatchdog groups such as the Campaign Legal Center, American Oversight, and Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington say that despite Ross' disclosures \u2014 and the series of amendments he has filed \u2014 they continue to have questions about what he has actually divested.\n\nRoss has reported putting some assets into what he, in one interview, described as a \"family trust.\" That, too, has sparked more questions about exactly which assets were put into the trust and how the trust is set up.\n\nRoss has told ethics officials that he and his wife do not have a financial interest in the trust, though it isn't entirely clear who does. In June 2018, he told CNBC that he has \"no economic interest\" in the trust and used it to divest \"illiquid\" assets \"that were very difficult to sell.\"\n\nNew level of ethics problems?\n\nFox, the former OGE head, said the question he is asked most often about Ross is how the government will hold him accountable for his ethics issues. \"And I don't always have a great answer for that.\"\n\nDuring the Bush and Obama administrations, he said, political accountability would have been the first line of defense \u2014 a call to the White House counsel's office, to say someone isn't complying with an ethics agreement.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Claire Harbage/NPR Claire Harbage/NPR\n\nWalter Shaub, the head of the Office of Government Ethics when Trump took office, stepped down in July 2017 and has since become a prominent critic of the administration's handling of ethics. \"We're seeing a level of ethics problems we just haven't seen\" in past administrations, he said, which has thrown the limitations of the ethics program \u2014 and OGE's lack of enforcement power \u2014 into stark relief.\n\nThe ethics rules, he said, were always dependent on appointees abiding by norms, and on presidents, wary of political scandal, \"pushing their own staffs to behave. And we're discovering that you can't always count on that if you have a president who doesn't care about the ethics rules.\"\n\nShaub, now at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said he is hopeful the parade of scandals will push Congress to both exercise oversight and strengthen the system. He recently testified at a House committee hearing on how anti-corruption legislation proposed by Democrats would strengthen the Office of Government Ethics by granting it subpoena power and more enforcement ability, among other things, proposals he has endorsed.\n\nDisclosure violations may seem technical, but ultimately, he said, government ethics rules are essential for the public trust.\n\n\"They enable us,\" he said, \"to have trust in the idea that the people in whom we entrust great power are using that power solely for our own benefit and not for their benefit.\"\n\nThe Center for Public Integrity is a nonpartisan, nonprofit investigative news organization in Washington, D.C.

    "text": "Fox News had a big influence on President Donald Trump's willingness to push the federal government into a shutdown, according to a new report.\n\nThe New Yorker reported on Monday that Trump was swayed by Fox News anchors and pundits during government-shutdown negotiations, and that advisers were forced to walk the president back from the brink of shutting down the government.\n\nThe effect of the Fox News hosts on shutdown negotiations first reared its head in March 2018, according to The New Yorker, when Trump suddenly threatened to veto a bipartisan spending deal just days before the federal government was set to run out of funds.\n\nWhile Trump eventually did sign the bill, the president was clearly perturbed by the large spending increase included as part of the package and the lack of wall. During a signing ceremony for the omnibus spending bill, Trump called the passage of the package a \"ridiculous situation\" and threatened to \"never sign another bill like this again.\"\n\nTrump was prepared to veto the bill, the report said, after receiving a wave of criticism from Fox News hosts, pundits, and guests about the deal's lack of funds for a wall along the US-Mexico border. But then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was able to convince Trump that a shutdown would be disastrous for the military, and the argument was enough to get Trump to sign the bill.\n\nA former top White House aide told The New Yorker that the sudden reversal and near veto \"was all Fox.\"\n\nRead more: Fox News reportedly killed its story on Trump's alleged affair with Stormy Daniels weeks before the election\n\nSimilarly, Trump reversed course on a funding bill in December 2018 after Fox News hosts and guests bashed the lack of wall funding in that deal. But in contrast to the near miss in March, Trump's change of heart actually led to a record-shattering, 35-day shutdown.\n\nPolitico reported at the time that Trump's anger over the criticism from Fox News hosts and other conservative pundits was a contributing factor to the president's decision to reject a short-term bipartisan funding bill.\n\n\"Lobbying via cable news works,\" a former senior White House official told Politico.",

The government was shut down for much of December and January, but a temporary deal to halt the shutdown was implemented in late January.\n\nReuters reports that the new agreement does not contain the $5.7 billion President Donald Trump wants for a wall on the southern US border.\n\n\"Equity markets in Asia followed Wall St's lead higher following an agreement in principle by US lawmakers to avert a fresh government shutdown, granting President Trump $1.4 billion in funding for border controls, but only for bollard fencing not an actual wall, and well below his desired $5.8 billion,\" Mike van Dulken, the head of research at Accendo Markets, wrote in an email.\n\nRead more: This is the only chart to watch ahead of the world's impending economic slowdown\n\nAlongside hopes that a fresh shutdown can be avoided, markets are buoyed by continued optimism that trade talks between Washington and Beijing will yield a positive outcome.\n\nRepresentatives from the US and China began talks in Beijing on Monday, with the aim of making progress toward a trade deal of some form before the 90-day deadline imposed at the G20 summit in Argentina late in 2018.\n\nTalks are expected to be conducted between relatively junior officials before Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer take over on Thursday and Friday.\n\nOptimism around trade and the prospect of an avoided shutdown have contributed to a substantial rally in equities around the world, with Asian and European stocks jumping Tuesday and US equities set to continue the strong start to the week they witnessed Monday.

    "text": "President Donald Trump's strongest supporters on his hardline immigration stance are already railing against a tentative border deal that lawmakers reached late Monday night, as another potential government shutdown looms just days away.\n\nA group of 17 lawmakers from the House and Senate struck a tentative agreement to provide $1.375 billion for 55 miles of steel bollard-style fencing at the US-Mexico border, multiple outlets reported. It would also fund only 40,520 detention beds maintained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement \u2014 a 17% drop from the amount currently filled.\n\nRead more: The tentative deal to avoid a 2nd shutdown would give Trump less than 25% of the money he wants for the wall\n\nBut the wall funding was a far cry from the $5.7 billion that Trump had demanded, and the agreement stipulated that only \"existing technologies\" be used for the barrier \u2014 meaning no use of concrete or Trump's border-wall prototypes will be permitted, according to Bloomberg News reporter Sahil Kapur\u200f.\n\n\"1.3 billion? That's not a \u2014 not even a wall. A barrier?\" Fox News host Sean Hannity, one of Trump's top confidants, said on his show Monday night.\n\nHe continued: \"Any Republican that supports this garbage compromise \u2014 you will have to explain. Look at this crowd, look at the country, look at CBS News. Even they say 72% of the American people want the heroin to stop, the cartels to stop, the gang members to stop, and those that wish us ill.\"\n\n'Hardly a serious attempt'\n\nPresident Donald Trump stands in front of one of his border-wall prototypes erected near San Diego, California. The bipartisan deal lawmakers tentatively reached on Monday would prohibit wall funding from being used to construct Trump's prototypes. Kevin Lamarque/Reuters\n\nIf the deal falls apart, or it Trump chooses not to approve it by Friday night, the government will run out of funding and trigger another shutdown just three weeks after the longest government shutdown in US history.\n\nBut that hasn't deterred some Republican lawmakers, who blasted the deal on Monday night and Tuesday morning. Rep. Andy Biggs, an Arizona Republican, slammed the tentative agreement as a \"bipartisan failure.\"\n\nIn a statement Tuesday morning, Biggs urged Trump instead to use executive powers to build the wall, and went after the committee for slightly lowering restrictions on ICE detention beds, arguing that the measure would prevent agents from deporting \"criminally violent illegal aliens.\"\n\n\"The American people should be outraged when they learn about the border security provisions of this deal,\" he said. \"Instead of listening to Border Patrol experts, conferees decided to chart their own path towards a political comfortable solution.\"\n\nHe wasn't the only Republican lawmaker to speak out against the agreement. Rep. Mark Meadows of North Carolina, another longtime Trump ally, tweeted Monday night that the agreement was \"hardly a serious attempt to secure our border or stop the flow of illegal immigration.\"\n\n\"Democrats applaud sending $1.8 billion to Iran under Obama but can't even find that much to secure America's border.

According to the tentative deal a bipartisan conference committee reached, the new wall funding would be used only for barriers using \"existing technologies\" like bollard fencing.
