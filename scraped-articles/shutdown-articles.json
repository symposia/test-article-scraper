    "text": "Photo: Scott Olson (Getty Images)\n\nNo one wants to wait in an hour-long security line, but it\u2019s always a possibility\u2014now more than ever. One app designed to show you wait times may help save you from the crowds.\n\nNearly a month into the U.S. government shutdown and federal workers across the country are bearing the brunt of working while unpaid. Others, under extreme financial strain, are forced to call out of work in the hopes of securing another job.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration has reported a 55% increase in their employees calling in sick, compared to this same time a year ago. And these staff shortages are resulting in inescapable long security lines for travelers.\n\nRecently, travelers departing from Hartsfield-Jason Atlanta International Airport have been warned to allow at least three hours before departure time because of long security lines. Miami International Airport temporarily closed an entire terminal because of TSA staff shortages, effectively squeezing passengers into its remaining available terminals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWorried you\u2019ll miss your upcoming flight while the shutdown remains in full effect? Check out the TSA\u2019s very own app, MyTSA.\n\nScreenshot: Josh Ocampo\n\nAvailable to download for free on the Itunes App Store and Google Play, MyTSA allows you to locate an airport and find information that will affect your flight like possible delays, weather conditions, and security line wait times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile information about delays is collected from the Federal Aviation Administration, wait times are actually crowd-sourced and collected by the app\u2019s very own users, like the Waze of airline travel.\n\nIf there isn\u2019t any information on the current wait time or you\u2019re planning your trip well in advance, TSA also uses prior data to make informed guesses about how long a security line might take on any given time and date, too. If you want to help out your fellow passengers, you can report the wait time yourself on the app\u2019s dashboard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHave any other travel related questions? You can even contact TSA directly on the app\u2019s live messenger service.\n\n\n\nPhoto: Spencer Platt (Getty Images)\n\nIf you want to be up-to-date on any delays, also be sure to download your departing airline\u2019s app, too. Usually, these apps allow you to check on important status updates or gate changes.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBetter yet, if you\u2019re in a middle seat, you can take a look at your flight\u2019s updated seat map on the app; Airlines may upgrade some passengers closer to takeoff, allowing you to swoop in and grab that much-needed window seat."

    "title": "How Your 1040 Tax Form Is Changing This Year",
    "text": "Image: Helloquence on Unsplash\n\nYour federal income taxes are going to look a little different this year, thanks to the 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs Act. Credits and deductions have changed, as has your 1040.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s not really postcard-sized, but it is different. Here\u2019s the breakdown.\n\nWhat Is a 1040?\n\nFirst up, if you\u2019re not familiar with the names attached to different documents, IRS Form 1040 is your general income tax form, on which you report your income and work out your refund.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the past, there was the standard 1040, the 1040EZ\u2014which was for less complicated returns like those filing single\u2014and the 1040A. This year, you\u2019re only going to use a redesigned 1040\u2014the 1040EZ and 1040A are no more. (That said, if you\u2019re catching up on returns for years prior to 2018, you\u2019ll still use those.)\n\nYou can download a 1040 and fill it out by hand, or use tax software that will input your information for you.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy Was It Changed?\n\nAs mentioned above, Republicans have long promoted the idea of a tax return the size of a postcard, and most Americans would likely agree that that would be preferable to the mix of forms and schedules we have to deal with now. \u201cTreasury approved a new approach that provides flexibility in how IRS will be able to manage future changes to the Form 1040 and reduce the number of 1040 forms from which taxpayers must choose, to one basic Form 1040 that all taxpayers will use,\u201d notes the IRS.\n\nThe 2017 Tax Cuts & Jobs bill did downsize your 1040, but it didn\u2019t exactly simplify things, as CNBC notes:\n\nThough the form is now \u201cpostcard-sized,\u201d filers will still need to pick through additional paperwork \u2014 known as schedules \u2014 in order to calculate their tax breaks, including the deductions for educator expenses and your health savings account contributions.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo now you have a smaller 1040 form, but six additional schedules to fill out, depending on the credits and deductions you\u2019re taking (granted, software works through the forms for most of us).\n\nWhat\u2019s Actually Different?\n\nThe main difference is rather than workout deductions and credits on your 1040, you will now do that on various Form 1040 Schedules (those with a very simple tax situation won\u2019t need to fill out any of the six schedules).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe 2018 Form 1040 uses a \u2018building block\u2019 approach so the federal tax return could be reduced to a single, simple form,\u201d says the IRS. \u201cTaxpayers can supplement this form with new numbered schedules, if needed.\u201d\n\nThe IRS notes that if you use software, you might not notice any real difference\u2014the machine will fill it in for you.\n\nSchedule 1: Additional Income and Adjustments to Income\n\nYou\u2019ll fill this out if you have additional income, \u201csuch as capital gains, unemployment compensation, prize or award money [or] gambling winnings,\u201d per the IRS. You\u2019d also include alimony income or payments, rental income, farm income, etc.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou will also use this schedule for any deduction, \u201csuch as student loan interest deduction, self-employment tax [or] educator expenses,\u201d and the health savings account deduction.\n\nSchedule 2: Tax\n\nYou need to file this form if you owe the Alternative Minimum Tax, or owe the tax on a child\u2019s unearned income.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSchedule 3: Nonrefundable Credits\n\nYou\u2019ll fill out Schedule 3 if you \u201ccan claim a nonrefundable credit other than the child tax credit or the credit for other dependents, such as the foreign tax credit, education credits [or] general business credit.\u201d\n\n\n\nSchedule 4: Other Taxes\n\nSchedule 4 will be filed if you owe \u201cself-employment tax, household employment taxes, additional tax on IRAs or other qualified retirement plans and tax-favored accounts.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSchedule 5: Other Payments and Refundable Credits\n\nYou will file Schedule 5 if you can \u201cclaim a refundable credit other than the earned income credit, American opportunity credit, or additional child tax credit.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSchedule 6: Foreign Address and Third Party Designee\n\nFinally, file Schedule 6 if you \u201chave a foreign address or a third party designee other than your paid preparer.\u201d This is where you\u2019ll list your country, province and postal code if you have a home outside the U.S., which used to be done on page 1 of the 1040.\n\n(Note: These are different than other existing schedules, which are still in use for 2018: Schedule A, Schedule B, Schedule C, Schedule D, Schedule E, Schedule F, Schedule H, Schedule J, Schedule R, Schedule SE and Schedule 8812.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat\u2019s Stayed the Same?\n\nPer the IRS, the following parts of the 1040 \u201cbasically\u201d remain unchanged:\n\nthe spaces for names and Social Security numbers,\n\nthe spaces for signatures remain on page one,\n\nthe checkboxes for selecting the Filing Status and\n\nthe checkboxes for the Presidential election campaign. The checkbox for reporting full year health care coverage or exemption is on page one of the 2018 Form 1040.\ufeff\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAgain, it\u2019s possible taxpayers who file electronically or hire someone (the vast majority of people) won\u2019t notice a difference, and those with simple tax situations will not need to worry the six schedules. The bigger change is likely to be if you decide to switch from itemizing to the larger standard deduction this year."

    "title": "What to Do Before and After Being Laid Off",
    "text": "Image: Alex Kotliarskyi on Unsplash\n\nIt\u2019s been a brutal few weeks in media, as BuzzFeed, the Huffington Post, Vice, Gannett and McClatchy laid off thousands of workers. But it\u2019s not just journalists who have been hurting recently: GM is laying off thousands of workers over the next two weeks, Sears\u2019s bankruptcy has imperiled tens of thousands of jobs, and the government shutdown left hundreds of thousands of people without a paycheck for weeks.\n\n\n\nAll of these job losses drive home the importance of having an emergency fund (or layoff fund), of course, but there are also plenty of other steps and precautions you can take before and after a layoff to help ease the financial (and psychological) pain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrepare As Best You Can\n\nYou\u2019re not always going to know when layoffs are coming, but in some cases it can be more obvious than others\u2014your company isn\u2019t doing well, you\u2019ve had a round of layoffs already, or you\u2019re given a heads up.\n\nYes, you\u2019ll want to increase your cash savings if possible, but there are other things to do as well. Tiffany Yannetta, who was laid off from Racked (which is now The Goods) about a year ago told Charlotte Cowles for the Cut that she made a checklist of important financial tasks to do before she found herself without a job.\n\nShe went to her all her doctors\u2019 appointments (in case she lost her health insurance) and did a deep dive on her debit card statements to evaluate her spending. \u201cObviously, I didn\u2019t have enough time to save anything significant, but at least I had a plan for where I could cut back on expenses,\u201d she says. She also researched industry standards for severance so that when the day arrived she knew exactly what she was going to ask for.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat last point is important. If you don\u2019t have a union to bargain a severance agreement for you, know that you can negotiate your severance package. For example, according to the Balance, you might negotiate:\n\nAdditional weeks of salary, sometimes based on your tenure at the employer\n\n\n\nPayment for unused vacation and sick days\n\n\n\nA lump sum payment to account for lack of notice of employment termination\n\n\n\nMedical or dental benefits or life insurance\n\n\n\nRetirement or 401k benefits\n\n\n\nStock options\n\n\n\nHelp to find a new job within or outside the company\n\n\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re over forty or in another protected class (race, gender, LGBT, disability, etc.) you might want to tell your employer that you\u2019re willing to give up some specific set of claims you could arguably bring against it, but that you need more than a month\u2019s salary to do so,\u201d suggests Victoria Pynchon, a negotiation consultant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdditionally, make sure that all of the paperwork for any work retirement and health insurance accounts are linked to your personal email, so that you can access them easily.\n\nBack Up Your Important Information\n\nIf your company owns your computer/cellphone, make sure you\u2019re consistently backing up any important information you need, like reports you\u2019ve worked on, contact emails, etc.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToo often your access might be shut off before you\u2019re ready when you\u2019re laid off, and you\u2019ll wish you had backups of your work. This is also a reminder not to use your work computer/email for personal communications (for example, planning a trip) that you don\u2019t want to lose access to.\n\nYou Don\u2019t Have to Sign Anything Right Away\n\nIf your company gives you a severance agreement to sign, have a lawyer or other representative look over it before you sign (in fact, the agreement will include language encouraging you to do this). Your employer shouldn\u2019t pressure you to sign anything before you\u2019ve been given some time to look over it. If you can\u2019t afford a lawyer, consider who else might be able to offer advice. \u201cOne woman who spoke to me anonymously (she signed an NDA as part of her exit package) was laid off from a start-up and sent her severance paperwork to her best friend, who worked in HR at a different company,\u201d writes Cowles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s important to take your time not only to make sure you\u2019re getting a decent severance package, but because you\u2019ll likely be signing away any of the workplace rights you have.\n\nFile for Unemployment\n\nWhile unemployment laws vary by state, typically you can only apply if you lost your job through no fault of your own. The Cut suggests asking your employer for a letter stating you were laid off without cause, which might help you secure the benefits. Then head to this site to find out how to apply in your state.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou must also be actively seeking work by making reasonable efforts to find employment,\u201d reports CNBC. \u201cJust be sure to keep a log of every place you\u2019ve sent your resume and each interview you\u2019ve had. You\u2019ll need to have it if you\u2019re summoned for an eligibility review.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, consider asking your boss for a letter of recommendation, which will help with your job search.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTake Time for Yourself\n\nYes, many of us don\u2019t have the financial security to take significant time off without pay. But when you go through something like a layoff, remember to take some time to yourself to regroup and work through your feelings. Our senses of self and worth are tied to our work, especially in America\u2014being let go can be harmful to our identity and how we perceived ourselves.\n\nIf you\u2019re able, don\u2019t jump right into looking for the next thing without reflecting on your old role. And, as Cowles suggests, remember that your old coworkers aren\u2019t the enemy\u2014talking through your situation together might be a helpful way to process your feelings.\n\nAdvertisement"

Right now, those monetary donations are as important as ever for diaper banks to be able to stay stocked to help families already in need, in case of natural disasters and in preparation for another potential government shutdown.\n\n\u201cEvery day we hear from federal workers who are having to choose between paying for housing and heating or having enough diapers for their children.\u201d Old says. \u201cThe need for support is at a critical level and will continue for some time as families try to regroup and get back on their feet.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDonate to one of these diaper bank organizations:\n\nFor more from Lifehacker, be sure to follow us on Instagram @lifehackerdotcom."

    "text": "Image: Thought Catalog on Unsplash\n\nToday marks the kickoff of tax season, and between the ongoing government shutdown and implementation of the 2017 tax law, it promises to be an interesting one (well...as interesting as tax season can get).\n\n\n\nWhether you\u2019re confused about whether to opt for the larger standard deduction or itemize deductions, or you just want to know what\u2019s going on with your Form 1040, we\u2019ve got you covered.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 2018 Tax Year Timeline\n\nHere are the important dates to keep in mind for tax season this year:\n\n\n\nJan. 28, 2019\n\nThe IRS begins processing 2018 tax returns.\n\nApril 15, 2019\n\nThe tax filing deadline for most people (April 15 is a Monday this year), as well as the deadline to file for an extension if you need to. Remember: If you think you will owe taxes, you still need to make a payment by this date to avoid late payment penalties.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is also the deadline for the first round of estimated quarterly taxes for January 1 through March 31, if you\u2019re a freelancer, and the last date you can make contributions to a Health Savings Account, IRA, Roth IRA, SEP-IRA or solo 401(k) for 2018.\n\nApril 17, 2019\n\nThe tax filing deadline for people Maine or Massachusetts \u201cbecause of the Patriots\u2019 Day holiday on April 15 in Maine and Massachusetts and the Emancipation Day holiday on April 16 in the District of Columbia.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJune 17, 2019\n\nThe second round of quarterly taxes are due, for freelance income earned between April 1 to May 31.\n\nAlso the deadline for for U.S. citizens living abroad to file returns or file for an extension.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSept. 16, 2019\n\nThe third round of quarterly taxes are due if you\u2019re freelance, for income earned between June 1 through August 31 (the final quarterly tax payment is due in January 2020).\n\nOctober 15, 2019\n\nDeadline to file a return for 2018 if you filed for an extension, and last day to file a return for 2018 electronically.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor more specific dates, check out this post.\n\nTax Brackets and Rates Are Different\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs you likely know, the income tax brackets, thresholds and rates were changed for 2018. The top marginal rate of 37 percent will apply to those with taxable income of $500,000 and higher for single filers and $600,000 and higher for married couples filing jointly, down from 39.6 percent applying to single filers with income over $418,400 and married couples with income over $470,700.\n\nYou can find the 2019 tax brackets here.\n\nWhat\u2019s Going on With Your Form 1040\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was a big push to simplify federal taxes, but the TCJA didn\u2019t really accomplish that. Still, it changed up your standard return form and added a bunch of new schedules. Here\u2019s the breakdown.\n\n\n\nTo Itemize, or Not to Itemize?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOne of the biggest questions is whether to take the standard deduction, a flat reduction in your adjusted gross income, or to itemize, which means you\u2019re picking applicable tax deductions to lower your AGI. Obviously, you\u2019ll likely want to choose whichever lowers your AGI the most, so you pay less in taxes. More on that here.\n\nHow Big Will Your Refund Be?\n\nImage: NeONBRAND on Unsplash\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause most families received a tax cut in 2018, you might be expecting a bigger refund this year. But as the Wall Street Journal explains, your mileage will vary. Writes the Journal\u2019s Richard Rubin:\n\n\n\nTax cuts and tax refunds aren\u2019t the same thing. The tax cut is the change in what people owed for 2018 compared with what they would have owed if Congress had done nothing. The refund is what happens when the IRS sends back any extra money people paid during 2018 or delivers any refundable tax credits.\n\nMany households will get a larger refund than they normally do, but others will not\u2014because they already received it via slightly larger paychecks throughout 2018. \u201cThat is because the IRS changed the default rules for calculating how much is withheld from paychecks for taxes,\u201d writes Rubin. \u201cThose changes took effect in February, though some taxpayers manually adjusted their withholding with their 2019 refunds in mind.\u201d It\u2019s possible you might owe taxes if you didn\u2019t change your withholdings last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhich Tax Software Should You Use?\n\nImage: rawpixel on Unsplash\n\nIf you earn less than $66,000 per year, you can file your state and federal taxes for free through the IRS\u2019s Free File program, a partnership between the agency and various tax preparation companies. In order to use the IRS\u2019s Free File completely for fee, then you need to go through the agency\u2019s web portal\u2014if you go through a tax preparer\u2019s site, you will likely get upsold.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you make over that, there are potentially still ways to file for free. The IRS notes that \u201cthere is Free File Fillable Forms, the electronic version of IRS paper forms which will be available when the IRS begins the filing season on Jan. 28.\u201d But there are also additional software options, including Credit Karma Tax, which is completely free for state and federal filings, and FreeTaxUSA, which offers free federal filings and $12.95 state filings. We have more information here on filing in each state.\n\nAnd if your tax situation is complicated, you experienced a major life change in the past year or, well, you\u2019re rich, consider hiring a tax preparer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow Long Will It Take to Get a Refund\n\nImage: A L L E F . V I N I C I U S \u0394 on Unsplash\n\nAs Lifehacker covered last year, the IRS \u201caims to issue all refunds within 21 days of your filing if you did so electronically, but it will take longer if you mailed in your return,\u201d usually anywhere from four to eight weeks. That said, the implementation of the new law means the IRS has had to update its systems, and those updates fell behind schedule. Coupled with the government shutdown kerfuffle, it could be a very taxing tax season. So give it a bit of time. Track your refund with the IRS2Go app or its online refund tool.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose are the basics\u2014stay tuned throughout tax season as we answer more of your specific tax questions."

    "text": "Image: rawpixel on Unsplash\n\nThis tax season promises to be an...interesting one, with the government shutdown and new tax law provisions colliding to create a perfect storm of confusion and inefficiency.\n\n\n\nWe\u2019ll get to implications of the shutdown in a later post. For now, it\u2019s important to understand how the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act changed up the credits and deductions available to tax payers. Here\u2019s what to know about tax deductions for tax year 2018. (Find info on 2018 tax credits here.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTax Deductions\n\nTax deductions lower your taxes by lowering the income you pay taxes on. So, for example, if your income is $50,000 and you take the standard deduction of $12,000 this year, you pay taxes on $38,000. (If you\u2019re really curious how your income is taxed, read this piece on marginal tax rates.)\n\nYou have the option of taking the standard deduction:\n\nStandard Deduction: The tax law raised the standard deduction to $12,000 for 2018 for individuals, and $24,000 for married couples, making it more attractive for more filers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOr itemizing your deductions. You might choose to itemize if your deductions are worth more than $12,000. For example:\n\nMortgage Interest : If you have a mortgage on a first home, second home, a home equity loan or a home equity line of credit (if the loan was used to expand/improve your home), you can deduct interest payments on the loan/loans, up to $750,000. This is down from $1 million in 2017.\n\n\n\n: If you have a mortgage on a first home, second home, a home equity loan or a home equity line of credit (if the loan was used to expand/improve your home), you can deduct interest payments on the loan/loans, up to $750,000. This is down from $1 million in 2017. State, and Local Income Taxes : You can deduct state and local taxes. But, you can only deduct up to $10,000 of state, local and property taxes combined, as stipulated by the 2017 tax law.\n\n: You can deduct state and local taxes. But, you can only deduct up to $10,000 of state, local and property taxes combined, as stipulated by the 2017 tax law. Property Taxes : You can deduct real estate taxes if you\u2019re a homeowner. But, as noted, you can deduct up to $10,000 of state, local and property taxes combined.\n\n: You can deduct real estate taxes if you\u2019re a homeowner. But, as noted, you can deduct up to $10,000 of state, local and property taxes combined. Medical Expenses : You can deduct medical expenses (like prescription costs, premiums, etc.) if those expenses have surpassed 7.5 percent of your adjusted gross income.

    "text": "Photo: rawpixel on Unsplash\n\nMany Americans rely on their tax refund to pay off bills, fund larger goals or, this year, keep them afloat as they wait for the government to reopen to be paid for doing their jobs. And while it might be tempting to take a tax refund advance, especially this year, consumer advocates warn against the practice.\n\n\n\nTaxpayers took around 1.7 million refund anticipation loans, or RALs, in 2017, an increase from 1.5 million in 2016, according to a report from the National Consumer Law Center.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the IRS has said it will pay out tax refunds as normal this year, some experts have expressed concern because of the government shutdown, which could make an advance more attractive to people who are struggling.\n\n\u201cConsumer advocates generally don\u2019t like refund-advance products, due to both high costs and the potential for scams,\u201d reports CNBC. \u201cAnd because the IRS often issues refunds quickly (by its own estimations, in less than 21 days), it\u2019s usually a better idea to steer clear.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTax preparation companies including H&R Block, Jackson-Hewitt, Liberty Tax and TurboTax offer advances based on your expected return. Those who qualify can receive the advance within 24 to 48 hours, notes Consumer Reports. If you go through one of the companies listed, you\u2019ll likely have to file your taxes with them, too.\n\nIf you need your refund ASAP and look for an advance product, know that nothing is ever free, even if the bank or financial institution bills it that way. \u201cDepending on the product and provider, there could be fees for applying for the advance, checking your credit and transferring the money to you,\u201d reports CNBC. If you\u2019re given a prepaid debit card to access the funds, that could also come with fees attached.\n\nMake sure you ask if you\u2019ll be charged fees or a penalty APR if your refund (your refund is the collateral to repay your loan) doesn\u2019t arrive when expected, particularly with the government shut down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFinally, if you\u2019re really struggling and considering an advance, check with a small local bank or credit union for short-term loans, suggests CNCBC, which may have better terms than the advances."

    "text": "Photo: Indigenous Peoples March (Facebook)\n\nThis week, social media has been set ablaze with a series of videos and images capturing a group of high school teenagers mocking a Native American man marching for indigenous rights in Washington D.C. If you\u2019re wondering what the indigenous movement is all about, here\u2019s what you need to know.\n\n\n\nWhat exactly is the Indigenous Peoples Movement?\n\nGenerally speaking, an indigenous peoples movement refers to any native population (beyond just Native American communities) seeking legal, political, and cultural recognition in a given country where that group feels underrepresented.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s also the name of a grassroots initiative, recently created by indigenous populations around the world, seeking greater representation from their respective nations. This initiative is supported by larger organizations like the Sierra Club (a group devoted to environmental causes).\n\nWhat is the Indigenous Peoples March?\n\nOn January 18, supporters of the Indigenous Peoples Movement planned to march together in Washington D.C, hoping to bring attention to issues of police brutality, corporate greed and government power (among others) affecting some indigenous nations, according to the group\u2019s statement.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRecently, Native American communities have been severely impacted by decisions made by the current presidential administration. These decisions include the construction of the Dakota Pipeline, polluting water sources for the Standing Rock Sioux community in North Dakota, and the ongoing government shutdown, affecting Native Americans who are federal workers and rely on its funding.\n\nCurrently, two Native American tribes are also suing the Trump administration over the approved construction of another pipeline, Keystone XL, that would cut through ancestral and sacred lands for the Fort Belknap Indian Community of Montana and the Rosebud Sioux Tribe of South Dakota.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Indigenous Peoples March was planned for the same day as the March for Life rally\u2014a pro-life organization.\n\nWhat does this have to do with the U.S.-Mexico wall?\n\nWithin the context of the videos capturing the confrontation, it\u2019s not obvious how this relates to the wall, but building a border would impact at least one Native American nation whose land would be cut in half.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince 2006, the Tohono O\u2019odham Nation, a nation that stretches from Arizona to Mexico, has been permitted to cross the border at three separate points. A wall would effectively stop their ability to pass back and forth.\n\n\u201cIt would be as if I walked into your home and felt like your home was not safe, but I want to build a wall right smack in the middle of your home and let me divide your family,\u201d Verlon Jose, a vice chairman of the Tohono O\u2019odham Nation told NPR. \u201cIt is putting a blockage into our way of life, into things that we\u2019ve been doing for hundreds and hundreds of years.\u201d\n\nHow can I help?\n\nIf you\u2019d like to help, you can donate directly to the Indigenous Peoples Movement on their webpage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA scholarship fund has also been set up via GoFundMe on behalf of Nathan Phillips, the Native American man at the center of discussion. All proceeds will go to the American Indian College Fund, a charity that supports scholarships for Native Americans seeking higher education."

    "title": "Antibiotics Are Failing Us. Crispr Is Our Glimmer of Hope",
    "text": "Humans and antibiotics have had a good run. These \u201cmiracle\u201d molecules have saved millions of lives and and alleviated incalculable suffering around the globe. But in the last few decades, as millions of tons of antibiotics were indiscriminately pumped into humans (and farm animals), the pace of bacterial evolution began to outstrip pharmaceutical innovation. Today, nearly every disease-causing bacteria has acquired defenses against these drugs. As the world\u2019s armory of effective medicines draws down, humans are running out of time to either change the behaviors that got us here, or come up with radically new treatments.\n\nBut breaking habits is hard, as a new study shows. According to an analysis of more than 19 million privately insured outpatients in the US, published today in The British Medical Journal, one in seven people were prescribed at least one course of pointless antibiotics in 2016. Extrapolated to the general US population, that could add up to tens of millions of unnecessary doses every year. \u201cThat\u2019s huge,\u201d says Kao-Ping Chua, a pediatrician at the University of Michigan Medical School, and a co-author of the study. \u201cDespite decades of investment in education about antibiotic stewardship, providers are still recommending drugs for illnesses that would get better on their own.\u201d\n\nIn the US, drug-resistant infections sicken more than two million people every year, and kill upwards of 23,000, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Such infections, which have doubled in the last decade, foist an extra $2.2 billion in health care costs on the US every year. Those numbers will only grow as the 26 antibiotics doctors currently count on become useless or significantly impaired, with very little coming down the pipeline to replace them. In 2018 alone, pharma giants Novartis, Sanofi and Allergan all sold off or closed up their antibiotics divisions.\n\nWhere there is hope, several years down the road, is in a totally different approach, using Crispr. Earlier this month, Janssen Pharmaceuticals\u2014a division of Johnson & Johnson\u2014announced an $818 million deal with a small Crispr startup called Locus Biosciences to develop a radical new way to rid the body of disease-causing bacteria, without causing resistance. Just as the powerful gene-editing tool has opened up new frontiers in genetic medicine, Janssen is betting it could also be the first dramatic innovation in antibiotics in decades.\n\nIt would certainly be an ironic turn of events, for all the bacteria involved.\n\nIt was bacteria, after all, that evolved Crispr systems in the first place, as a sort of primordial defense against invading viruses called bacteriophages. Locus\u2019 approach is to turn all this biology against nasty bugs like diarrhea-causing Clostridium difficile, and a species of E. coli commonly involved in urinary tract infections.\n\nLEARN MORE The WIRED Guide to Crispr\n\nThose pathogens each have certain genes that they need to function. Locus has designed Crispr systems to target those critical stretches of DNA, using a Crispr enzyme called Cas3 that shreds the DNA. Locus\u2019 scientists load the instructions for that Crispr payload; if it were conventional warfare, this would include a list of enemy strongholds to bomb and the directions for how to build each missile. Once loaded into phages and delivered to a patient, the Crispr system would only prey on the bacteria causing the infection. The company's scientists hope to avoid any possibility of evolving resistance by targeting multiple indispensable genes. \u201cWe\u2019re really building a precise way to reach into the body and take out only what we want removed,\u201d says CEO Paul Garofolo.\n\nProving that out will require human trials, which Locus plans to begin later this year for drug-resistant E. coli. That timeline, however, depends somewhat on the partial government shutdown, now stretching into its fourth week. The US Food and Drug Administration is not reviewing any applications for new drugs. This has Garofolo worried, but the recent cash infusion at least takes some of the pressure off. Under the terms of the Janssen deal, Locus is getting $20 million upfront to tailor its Crispr system to treat lung infections, with up to $798 million in potential milestone and royalty payments down the line.\n\nEven if the government shutdown ends tomorrow, it will still take years for a Crispr-based antibiotic to reach patients, if one ever does. In the meantime, researchers like Chua are evaluating other ways to help stem the tide of overprescribing. Apps that force doctors to justify their use of antibiotics before ordering them and automated emails that rank doctors\u2019 antibiotic stewardship relative to their peers have both shown promise in changing behavior.\n\nBut, says Chua, the core of medicine has not changed: It is still about a patient sitting in front of a doctor, suffering. Often the easiest thing to do is to default to writing a prescription. \u201cUnfortunately, a lot of the drivers are the culture of medicine\u2014being aggressive and not wanting to miss stuff\u2014which just feeds the cycle of expectations for patients,\u201d says Chua. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a technological fix for that.\u201d\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories"

Trump will speak before Congress Tuesday night at 9 pm EST for his annual update on these here United States. And not just Congress! You can watch too, with or without a cable subscription.\n\nFor a quick recap of the preceding drama: Trump had originally intended to give this year\u2019s State of the Union on January 29; speaker of the house Nancy Pelosi disinvited him due to the lengthy shutdown of significant parts of the federal government. Once Trump capitulated\u2014or, at least, agreed to a three-week reprieve\u2014he was welcomed back.\n\nTrump is expected to address his favorite topics, like immigration and China. But he\u2019ll also potentially discuss more future-looking initiatives around 5G and artificial intelligence. Both have been of interest to the White House, not only for their technological importance but also for their national security implications.\n\nAnd who knows! There may be some surprises in store as well. This is, after all, a president with a flair for the dramatic, as anyone who follows his Twitter feed or late-aughts WWE rivalries can attest. Stacey Abrams, who last year lost the tightly contested Georgia governor\u2019s race, will deliver the Democratic response afterwards.\n\nHow to Watch\n\nTo follow along, you can bookmark this page; we\u2019ll be hosting a live stream at the top.

If you\u2019re already living the Roku life, the Roku Channel will carry the speech for free as well.\n\nOr maybe you already have a trial for DirecTV Now or Hulu Live TV or YouTube TV or Fubo TV still going after you signed up for the Super Bowl. Use one of those!\n\nIf by now you feel like you have a pretty good handle on what Donald Trump looks like and would rather just listen, try TuneIn, which has a Roku app and will offer streams from a few sources, or NPR, which is NPR.\n\nHonestly, you\u2019d have to try pretty hard not to catch an event as widely broadcast as the State of the Union.

    "title": "The Excruciating, Impossible Science of Airport Delays",
    "text": "Friday morning began with delays at New York\u2019s LaGuardia Airport. That\u2019s not unusual\u2014New York\u2019s airports are famously balky. But this time, the cause wasn't something prosaic, like a blizzard. It was staffing. Because of the federal government shutdown, the airport didn\u2019t have enough Transportation Security Administration agents and air traffic controllers; things slowed to a ground stop.\n\nThen it started to spread\u2014Newark, Philadelphia, even the key hub of Atlanta all began to wind down. And that\u2019s terrifying. Airports are nodes on a global network, and the science that guides how that network behaves means that if one node has a problem, that problem will spread. The international air travel network exists on something of a knife-edge. It doesn\u2019t take much to knock it out of optimal flow.\n\nBasically, the delay problem is one of \"connected resources\"; planes land and have to get turned around to perform other flights, and some of the passengers on them are getting onto other flights, too. If you\u2019ve ever flown, you know all that, but what it means in practice is that small mistakes or delays at one airport get magnified as they move down the line, propagating and sometimes intensifying. \u201cThe systems operating these queues are very close to capacity,\u201d says Hamsa Balakrishnan, an aerospace engineer at MIT who studies the air transport network. \u201cBoth LaGuardia and Newark had wind-related delays today. With full staffing you might have been able to manage, but with a decrease in staffing as well you have delays, which then end up spreading to other airports as well, because of connectivity.\u201d\n\nTypically you might expect that the biggest airports in the world\u2014the ones with the most flights in and out, say, or that move the most people\u2014would have the biggest effect on overall movement across the network. But in fact, an airport\u2019s \u201cdelay propagation multiplier\u201d varies depending on all kinds of things, from how an airport is scheduled to its overall capacity, and even the weather. By one calculation, a minute of delay causes an average of 30 seconds of slowdown elsewhere in the network. But some airports are more resilient than others. The time it takes to get from one to the other has an effect. It\u2019s so complicated that it daunts even the most intrepid network modelers.\n\nAirlines try to account for all this by building slack into the schedule. They calculate the amount of time a given flight should take\u2014the \u201cscheduled block time\u201d\u2014and the amount of time the plane should have to spend on the ground, the \u201cscheduled turnaround time.\u201d But then they have a choice. \u201cThey insert buffer time in their schedules and ground operations,\u201d says Bo Zou, a transportation engineer at the University of Illinois. \u201cThey still encounter delays, and a newly formed delay for one flight will propagate to the second and third flights. Part of it will be absorbed by the buffer, but not all of it.\u201d Build too small a buffer, and the delays propagate further. Build too large a buffer and you\u2019re not using your fleet efficiently, and losing money. \u201cOne side is efficiency, the other is robustness,\u201d Zou says.\n\nAnd it changes all the time, depending on changing conditions\u2014some are predictable, like winter storms, and some are not, like government shutdowns and informal sick-outs. That\u2019s called a \u201cdynamical complex network.\u201d It has to adapt, constantly.\n\nBecause if it doesn\u2019t? According to one study, flight delays cost the US economy over $30 billion a year. It\u2019s not just lost time or flight expenses; it\u2019s whatever the people on those flights were planning on doing when they arrived. \u201cA prolonged shutdown, or even slow down, would likely affect all kinds of unforeseen things,\u201d says Lu\u00eds Bettencourt, a network scientist at the University of Chicago. \u201cThe reliability of time\u00ad-sensitive logistics will degrade, and the hub character of some of these cities will have to be bypassed, at least temporarily. A prolonged slow down would be most disastrous to large cities, their influence, and their economies.\u201d\n\nHaving shut down the shutdown, the government can now get its TSA agents and air traffic controllers back on station. That\u2019ll build some resilience back into the airports just in time for a big-ass snowstorm due to hit the midwest next week. But the overall health of the air travel network will still be precarious.\n\nThat\u2019s why researchers are working on accumulating more and more data on how it all works (or doesn\u2019t). If humans can\u2019t schedule all these flights in an efficient and robust way, maybe an algorithm can. Balakrishnan has even cofounded a startup that\u2019s trying to make it happen. \u201cThere are so many moving pieces that it\u2019s hard for a human being to come up with all possible solutions,\u201d she says. \u201cBut that\u2019s something we know how to get computers to do.\u201d If you enjoy flying on an intractable and incomprehensible network now, wait until it\u2019s run by an intractable, incomprehensible robot.\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories"

    "text": "This week, President Donald Trump signed a new executive order on artificial intelligence and the Pentagon declassified part of its AI strategy. Neither was a first attempt at a national AI strategy. In 2016, the Obama administration published a comprehensive plan on the future of AI, which never had time to gain the momentum it needed in government. The Pentagon has been researching intelligent machines for the better part of 60 years, and only recently did it come to a consensus: Our future wars will be fought in code, using data and algorithms as powerful weapons. Using AI techniques, a military can \u201cwin\u201d by destabilizing an economy rather than demolishing countrysides and city centers. From that perspective, and given China\u2019s unified march advancing artificial intelligence, China is dangerously far ahead of the West.\n\nWIRED OPINION ABOUT Amy Webb (@amywebb) is a professor at the NYU Stern School of Business and is the chief executive of the Future Today Institute, a strategic foresight and research group in Washington, DC.\n\nIn my view, we\u2019ve come to this realization too late. Regardless of what orders might be signed or what new strategies are put into action, Washington is going to have a recruitment problem: There just aren\u2019t enough incentives to lure AI talent away from high-paying jobs with great benefits into a life of public service.\n\nThe future of AI\u2014and, by extension, the future of humanity\u2014is already controlled by just nine big tech titans, who are developing the frameworks, chipsets, and networks, funding the majority of research, earning the lion\u2019s share of patents, and, in the process, mining our data in ways that aren\u2019t transparent or observable. Six are in the US, and I call them the G-MAFIA: Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, IBM, and Apple. Three are in China, and they are the BAT: Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent.\n\nThe few government agencies built for innovation\u2014the US Digital Service, the US Army\u2019s Futures Command, the Defense Innovation Board, and the Defense Innovation Unit (DIU) initiatives\u2014are brittle in their youth and subject to defunding and staff reductions as the revolving door of political appointees spins. In practical terms, there is too little strategic collaboration between the G-MAFIA and our government agencies or military offices\u2014at least not without a lucrative contract in place. While the G-MAFIA usually lobby for huge tax incentives and breaks to do business, they also must agree to the arcane, outdated procurement requirement policies of the military and government. This doesn\u2019t exactly accelerate AI in our national interest. If anything, it shines a bright light on the cultural differences between Silicon Valley and DC, and it slows down modernization.\n\nWashington and the G-MAFIA tend to view their relationship as transactional, not collaborative. During the past several years, neither lawmakers nor the White House has made an honest effort to develop the kind of relationships with G-MAFIA executives necessary for a long-term coalition on AI. The G-MAFIA, US military, and government circle around each other without ever converging in our national interest. Without collaboration, would-be researchers, scientists, and managers don\u2019t have the opportunity to meet each other, cultivate a network, and form the close relationships that typically lead to talent transfer between organizations like we typically see in other organizations.\n\nIn my own meetings at the Pentagon with Department of Defense officials, an alternative view on the future of warfare (code vs. combat) has taken too long to find widespread alignment. For example, in 2017, the DOD established an Algorithmic Warfare Cross-Functional Team to work on something called Project Maven\u2014a computer vision and deep-learning system that autonomously recognizes objects from still images and videos. The team didn\u2019t have the necessary AI capabilities, so the DOD contracted with Google for help training AI systems to analyze drone footage. But no one told the Google employees assigned to the project that they\u2019d actually been working on a military project, and that resulted in high-profile backlash. Four thousand Google employees signed a petition objecting to Project Maven. They took out a full-page ad in The New York Times, and ultimately dozens of employees resigned. Eventually, Google said that it wouldn\u2019t renew its contract with the DOD.\n\nAmazon, too, came under fire because of a Pentagon contract worth $110 billion. In October 2018, House Appropriations Committee members Tom Cole (R-Oklahoma) and Steve Womack (R-Arkansas) accused the DOD of conspiring with Amazon to tailor the contract so that no other tech giant would qualify. But that wasn\u2019t the only complaint. There was a small wave of dissent at Amazon. Some Amazon workers were outraged that the company would do any work at all with the US military, while others didn\u2019t like that Amazon\u2019s facial recognition technology was being used by law enforcement. In response, Jeff Bezos told an audience at WIRED's own 25th anniversary conference, \u201cIf big tech companies are going to turn their back on the US Department of Defense, this country is going to be in trouble.\u201d\n\nBut who would come and work on AI for the federal government or US military when the perks of Silicon Valley are spectacularly more attractive? I\u2019ve had lunch in the Navy\u2019s Executive Dining Facility in the Pentagon and on the G-MAFIA\u2019s campuses. The Navy\u2019s dining room is smartly appointed, with insignias on the plates and a trim daily menu of meal options\u2014and, of course, there is always a chance you could wind up sitting next to a three- or four-star admiral. That being said, enlisted women and men don\u2019t get to eat in the Executive Dining Facility. People who work at the Pentagon have a choice of food courts with Subway, Panda Express, and Dunkin Donuts. I had a toasted panini once at the Center Court Caf\u00e9, which was dry but edible. The food on the G-MAFIA\u2019s campuses isn\u2019t remotely comparable: organic poke bowls at Google in New York and seared diver scallops with maitake mushrooms and squid-ink rice at Google\u2019s office in LA. For free.\n\nLEARN MORE The WIRED Guide to Artificial Intelligence\n\nFood isn\u2019t the only perk within the G-MAFIA. Just after Amazon\u2019s Spheres opened in Seattle, a friend took me on a tour of what is essentially an enormous greenhouse/workspace. The Spheres are just marvelous: climate-controlled, glass-enclosed, self-contained ecosystems made up of 40,000 species of plants from 30 different countries. The air is clean and fragrant, the temperature is around 72 degrees regardless of what the weather is like outside, and there are comfortable chairs, loungers, and tables all around. There\u2019s even an enormous tree house. Amazon staff are free to work in the Spheres anytime they want. I was once called into a meeting with some senior State Department officials. It was a drab, white, windowless room with creaky old chairs, a stained whiteboard, and an electronics cabinet outfitted with a VCR player.\n\nIf recent trends hold, the G-MAFIA looks like it offers the biggest perk of all: long-term job security. During the past two decades, the government seems to have weaponized the budget, and that has resulted in a record number of shutdowns. There were three in 2018 alone, one of which was the longest in US history. If you\u2019ve ever worked for a startup or a company that\u2019s in trouble, you\u2019ve had to live with the stress of not knowing whether you\u2019ll get your next paycheck. Paradoxically, that\u2019s one reason people go into public sector work: to avoid that kind of stress. Even with the promise of back pay, it seems as if every few weeks federal workers are now bracing for the next government shutdown or recouping from the previous one.\n\nMy point is this: It\u2019s really hard to make the case for a talented computer scientist to join the government or military, given the current political climate and what the G-MAFIA offer. The opportunity cost of civic duty is far too great in the United States to attract our best and brightest to serve the nation.\n\nThe center courtyard of the Pentagon isn\u2019t going to transform into the Spheres anytime soon. But the government can allocate significant funding\u2014several billion to start\u2014for basic and advanced research in AI. It can use some of that money for better compensation packages, to build capacity among existing staff, and to fund projects allowing the tech giants and public sector to start working much more closely together. Collaboration is in the best long-term interests of the G-MAFIA too. AI is a massive field, and there is plenty of work to be done.\n\nExcerpted from The Big Nine: How the Tech Titans and Their Thinking Machines Could Warp Humanity by Amy Webb.

    "title": "If Trump Told Cohen to Lie, Impeachment Is Coming",
    "text": "As the government shutdown neared the one-month mark, the political landscape shifted under Washington\u2019s feet Thursday night, dramatically and perhaps permanently altering the path of our nation\u2019s politics. BuzzFeed\u2019s duo of Russia probe reporters posted a blockbuster report that President Donald Trump directed Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about the Trump Tower Moscow Project.\n\nThe allegation, which Buzzfeed sourced to two federal law enforcement officials, simultaneously adds new information to both the \u201ccollusion\u201d and \u201cobstruction\u201d sides of the Russia probe. The idea that the president of the United States directed his personal attorney to lie to legislators about his attempt to complete a hundred-million-dollar deal with Vladimir Putin in the midst of the presidential campaign is, in short, as big as it gets.\n\nAs Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island and a former prosecutor, laid out, the accusation at the core of the BuzzFeed report constitutes at least four potential felonies: \u201ccriminal obstruction of justice (18 U.S.C. 1505, 1512), subornation of perjury (18 U.S.C. 1622), conspiracy (18 U.S.C. 371), and likely aiding and abetting perjury (18 U.S.C. 2).\u201d Those phrases also meant something specific to students of recent political history: Suborning perjury was part of the articles of impeachment that targeted both Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton.\n\nSpecial counsel spokesperson Peter Carr took the unusual step of refuting Buzzfeed's story with what appears to be a carefully worded statement. \"BuzzFeed\u2019s description of specific statements to the Special Counsel\u2019s Office, and characterization of documents and testimony obtained by this office, regarding Michael Cohen\u2019s Congressional testimony are not accurate.\"\n\nWhile we\u2019ll be unpacking the implications of the apparent revelation for days to come, there are six aspects of the new report which, if true, make clear the scale of the political peril facing the president as of Friday morning:\n\n1. Mueller has the receipts. According to Buzzfeed, special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigators have more than Cohen\u2019s word to support the claim. In fact, the lead instead originated with documents and witnesses inside the Trump Organization, a great sign of how much visibility Mueller has into the private business world of Donald Trump pre-presidency.\n\nRemember that Trump Organization chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg received immunity from prosecutors and is cooperating. To have both your company's accountant and your personal fixer\u2014Cohen\u2014turn on you usually is criminally fatal. This report from BuzzFeed, as rich in detail as it is, probably represents just the tip of the iceberg of Mueller\u2019s knowledge. Every single indictment and court filing from Mueller has been more detailed, more knowledgeable, and better informed than we imagined. And this is just one of at least 17 investigations targeting the president's circle right now, run by at least seven different sets of prosecutors. The potential criminal liability remains enormous.\n\n2. The politics just changed in a big way. Any investigation that targets the president of the United States is more a political question than a criminal question. The ultimate judge and jury would almost certainly be Congress or the voters, either in an impeachment trial or a reelection bid.\n\nThe president's family is potentially in lots of legal trouble.\n\nThese allegations are about lying to Congress, which makes it harder for Congress to brush them away\u2014and given the new Democratic majority in the House, they\u2019re certainly not inclined to. Democrats in Congress were quick out of the gate hinting at the \u201cI\u201d word (which coincidentally also appears on the cover of the latest issue of The Atlantic). The chair of the House Judiciary Committee, where impeachment articles would begin, moved further than he has before in discussing the seriousness of the accusation.\n\nThe allegation that the president is instructing people to lie to Congress cuts to the heart of its legitimacy as a co-equal branch of government. While they\u2019ve so far seemingly ignored the fact that the president, aka Individual 1, is already an unindicted co-conspirator in Cohen\u2019s campaign finance case, lying to Congress is the kind of violation that gets even staid institutionalists squawking.\n\n3. The obstruction case could be much bigger than Comey. The BuzzFeed report also helps provide context to our evolving understanding of a potential obstruction of justice case focused on the president. Whereas we\u2019ve tended to shorthand that area of the probe as focusing on the firing of FBI director James Comey, it\u2019s quite possible that Mueller won\u2019t in the end focus on any single incident, but will instead paint a broader picture of Trump's apparent years-long effort to hide the truth of his dealings with Russia, during the campaign, the transition, and even into the White House.\n\nWe\u2019ve known for some time that Mueller was interested in the cover-up of the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting, as well. As I mentioned in December, he has already pointed us to what worries him: \u201cA specific line from the special counsel\u2019s filing in Cohen\u2019s case also jumps out: \u2018By publicly presenting this false narrative, the defendant deliberately shifted the timeline of what had occurred in hopes of limiting the investigations into possible Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election.\u2019 It\u2019s not hard to imagine that same line cut and pasted into a future obstruction case regarding Donald Trump\u2019s personal handling of a false narrative put out by the White House after reports first surfaced of the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower.\u201d\n\nIf Cohen was conspiring with the president, after the fact, to cover up the Trump Tower Moscow project, that would alter the whole timeline of an obstruction case. It would no longer hinge on Trump\u2019s thinking on the precise date in May 2017 when he fired Comey, but instead could point to a pattern of actions and behaviors over nearly three years\u2014up to present day, potentially\u2014that would be hard to explain away as constitutionally valid.\n\n4. The president's family is potentially in lots of legal trouble. The BuzzFeed report also says that Cohen kept the Trump children up to date on his plans, which was hinted at in the earlier court filings around Cohen's guilty plea concerning his lies to Congress. We've long known that unnamed \"executives\" of the Trump Organization were involved in both the campaign finance conspiracy surrounding the hush money payments to Stormy Daniels, as well as the Moscow Trump Tower project. The most likely suspects have always been Trump's children\u2014the idea, after all, that the vaunted \"Trump Organization\" is anything more in day-to-day reality than a small family business has long been a fiction. It's Donald Trump and his children. The BuzzFeed reporting now attaches names\u2014Ivanka and Donald Jr.\u2014to that suspicion and shows that the president's family and his innermost circle are almost certainly going to be wrapped up in the investigation in the days, weeks, or months ahead. That's doubly true given that the House Intelligence Committee plans to hand over additional evidence to Mueller of other witnesses it suspects lied to Congress\u2014a list that seems likely to include Donald Trump Jr.\n\nThe president has brushed away other targets of Mueller's probe as coffee boys, short-timers, or people he hardly knew. It's tougher to do that if it's your son or daughter, but not impossible given the president's only casual affiliation to the truth.\n\n5. Trump's incoming attorney general already said it's a crime. This week, US attorney general nominee William Barr appears to have already boxed himself in. While much of the questioning of Barr focused on how, when, and what he might make public from a still-theoretical \u201cMueller report,\u201d US senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota zeroed in on what Barr would consider troublesome behavior by the occupant of the White House: \u201cThe president persuading a person to commit perjury would be obstruction, is that right?\u201d Barr\u2019s answer was simple: \u201cYes.\u201d Which is to say, two days before tentative evidence emerged that Trump allegedly did just that, his presumptively incoming attorney general said that behavior would surely represent a crime.\n\nRemember, we again likely only know a fraction of the evidence Mueller could present about the president\u2019s behavior at this point.\n\n6. Trump's defense team is rattled. Lastly, the president\u2019s TV lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, tried unsuccessfully to move the goalposts of the investigation this week. After months of endlessly repeating the phrase \u201cno collusion,\u201d Giuliani tried to tell CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo that he had only meant there was no personal collusion by the president himself\u2014he can\u2019t speak for the rest of the campaign: \u201cI never said there was no collusion between the campaign, or people in the campaign. I said the president of the United States. There is not a single bit of evidence the president of the United States committed the only crime you can commit here, conspiring with the Russians to hack the DNC.\u201d\n\nMost of the umbrage at the absurdity of Giuliani\u2019s statement focused on the first half, but the second half is almost more interesting from the standpoint of how the president\u2019s potential defense is shaping up\u2014evidently, that it would only be a crime if the president actively conspired in advance with Russian intelligence to attack and leak Democratic officials\u2019 inboxes. Of course, that\u2019s absurd. There are any manner of crimes Donald Trump could have committed either before or after the DNC hack\u2014and while we haven't seen public evidence of such crimes, it certainly seems like the president\u2019s own defenders are worried evidence exists.\n\nPutting it all together, unfortunately, we\u2019re still left with this: The president should almost hope that Robert Mueller concludes he\u2019s a Russian agent, because the alternative might be even worse. As I wrote earlier this week, a lifetime ago in this investigation given Thursday\u2019s new bombshell, \u201cWe\u2019ve reached a point in the Mueller probe where there are only two scenarios left: Either the president is compromised by the Russian government and has been working covertly to cooperate with Vladimir Putin after Russia helped win him the 2016 election\u2014or Trump will go down in history as the world\u2019s most famous \u2018useful idiot,\u2019 as communists used to call those who could be co-opted to the cause without realizing it.\u201d\n\nThursday\u2019s revelations\u2014lending new weight to both the obstruction and collusion questions\u2014make clear that the answer might be, simply \u201cboth, all of the above.\u201d\n\nGarrett M.

    "title": "Trump's Wall Won't Solve a National Emergency. It Is One",
    "text": "After weeks\u2014years, really\u2014of debate over the Trump administration's proposed wall at the US-Mexico border, Congress will vote on a spending bill Thursday that includes $1.375 billion for 55 miles of border fence construction. In response, President Donald Trump signaled that he will declare a national emergency to get the wall built regardless. Doing so will create more problems than it solves.\n\nBeyond the politicization of a wall as a cure-all for immigration woes, border security experts continue to stress\u2014as they have since Trump's campaign days\u2014that a physical wall is simply not a practical or effective way to support law enforcement at the border. While human rights and privacy groups raise important concerns about alternatives like border-surveillance technologies, or the concept of a \"smart wall,\" the fact is that Democrats and Republicans in Congress largely agree on how to fund border patrol and enforcement technologies. And despite the pressures of a looming deadline that may yet again shut down the government, Capitol Hill has denied Trump the contiguous wall he has so adamantly championed.\n\n\"The wall is expensive and unnecessary given the current level of flow into the United States,\" says Alex Nowrasteh, senior immigration policy analyst at the Cato Institute. \"These government mega-construction projects usually cost at least 50 percent more than what\u2019s budgeted. We estimate that each mile of wall would cost about $36 million to construct, and it won\u2019t have a major impact on deterrence, because most of the people coming are asking for asylum.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s at the ports of entry that we can do so much more than what we\u2019re doing.\" Christopher Wilson, Wilson Center\n\nThirty years ago, illegal border crossings at the border largely consisted of Mexican men trying to get into the US to find work. The billions of dollars the US has spent to date on physical barriers were founded in that reality. But today, despite Trump's \"bad hombres\" rhetoric, the majority of those approaching or attempting to cross the border are women and children seeking asylum. That often occurs at official points of entry anyway; when it doesn't, asylum seekers still generally intend to turn themselves in quickly.\n\nChristopher Wilson, deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center, says that these days the most constructive funding is for \"border security that isn\u2019t about the wall.\"\n\n\"A lot of it needs to go to the ports of entry rather than the areas between the ports of entry,\" Wilson says. \"It\u2019s at the ports of entry that we can do so much more than what we\u2019re doing, both in terms of facilitating legal travel and trade while enhancing border security.\"\n\nWilson notes that physical barriers at the border have historically been a helpful deterrent to marijuana trafficking, but that they are less effective at slowing the flow of high-potency drugs like the synthetic opioid fentanyl. These drugs can be trafficked in much smaller quantities and smuggled through legitimate points of entry like checkpoints, on airplanes, and in the mail. Cato's Nowrasteh calls the wall proposal \"yesterday\u2019s solution to yesterday\u2019s problem\u2014at best.\"\n\nPhysical barriers also don't eliminate criminal behavior; they just relocate it. \"If we rely on the wall to stop individuals, and we don't also improve detection methods through technology and response through personnel, then we will find routes across the border displaced rather than deterred,\" says Brandon Behlendorf, a homeland security researcher at SUNY-Albany. \"You also need technology\u2014cameras, sensors, databases, et cetera\u2014and personnel agents and support staff to secure the borders.\"\n\nThe widely varied geography and topography of the US-Mexico border also calls for a variety of protective measures. There's no one-wall-fits-all solution. In remote regions, where it takes time for enforcement personnel to respond to potentially illegal activity, physical barriers\u2014like the hundreds of miles of fencing that already exists at the border\u2014are relatively effective and help buy time for enforcement response. In areas where border personnel are based or have an established presence, such physical barriers can actually inhibit security efforts, making it logistically harder for agents to see what's going on and get to the right spots quickly.\n\n\"The border is a system constantly searching for its equilibrium.\" Brandon Behlendorf, SUNY-Albany\n\nTo that end, Thursday's 1,159-page spending bill earmarks three-quarters of a billion dollars for border security technology, of which $570 million must focus on \"non-intrusive inspection equipment at ports of entry.\" Customs and Border Protection and the Department of Homeland Security have been working for years to develop an array of border-security tech tools that include body scanners, cameras, infrared sensors, and radar deployed to collectively create a sort of invisible web or dome along and across the border. Sensors are positioned on the ground, on fences, on posts, and higher up through CBP's Integrated Fixed Towers program\u2014which is working on syncing and coordinating various types of sensors. Another crucial component is aerial monitoring from manned planes and helicopters, as well as drones and sensor-equipped blimps. Thursday's bill includes about $2.5 billion to be dispensed through 2023 on border-security-related vehicles, including drones.\n\n\"It does not fund the president\u2019s wall, but it does support smart border-security initiatives that both parties have always supported, including increased security at our ports of entry and humanitarian assistance at the border,\" said Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer on the floor Thursday. \"Most importantly, it will keep our government open.\"\n\nMost of all, the months and years spent arguing about a wall could have been much better spent implementing an array of border protections to be effective, but also humane and privacy-preserving. \"As you implement new technologies along the border, there are lots of important questions about how to go about doing it,\" the Wilson Center's Wilson says. \"Like is it collecting personal data that needs to be protected? It's kind of crazy that instead of having those important discussions we\u2019re having this wild political discussion about a wall.\"\n\nAnalysts also consistently emphasize the importance of seeing border security in the larger context of geopolitics and policy decisions. \"Border security is not a stand-alone thing,\" SUNY's Behlendorf says. \"It is part of a larger immigration and border-security system, and some of the most effective solutions to border security lie outside direct efforts to secure the border. Deploying technology is important, but so is reducing immigration court backlogs and improving legitimate entry into the United States, including asylum requests. The border is a system constantly searching for its equilibrium.\"\n\nMeanwhile, by declaring a national emergency over something that is clearly not one, Trump sets a dangerous precedent and unlocks executive authority that will likely face bipartisan pushback. It's unclear, though, whether anyone has the authority to stop him.\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories"

    "title": "Cybersecurity Workers Scramble to Fix a Post-Shutdown Mess",
    "text": "Two weeks out from the longest government shutdown in United States history\u2014and with the possibility of another still looming\u2014government employees are still scrambling to mitigate impacts on federal cybersecurity defenses. And the stakes are high.\n\nFurloughed cybersecurity employees returned to expired software licenses and web encryption certificates, colleagues burned out from working on skeleton crews, and weeks-worth of unanalyzed network activity logs. The job was already hard enough without having to play catch-up.\n\n\"There's tension in the air,\" says Christopher Kennedy, chief information security officer at the network security firm AttackIQ who spent more than 10 years as a federal security contractor for agencies like the Treasury, Department of Commerce and US Marines Corps. \"As an incident responder, you just found activity that took place three weeks ago, and now you have to quarantine and clean up and fix it when three weeks of damage has already been done. The work is harder and more chaotic and maybe your toolset doesn\u2019t work because a license is expired plus maybe people's security clearances have expired. All of those things are adding together.\"\n\nEven before the shutdown, the federal government was not known for a robust, consistent security posture. In a May report, the White House's Office of Management and Budget found that 74 percent of federal agencies are in urgent need of digital defense improvements. More than half don't have the ability to catalog the software that runs on their systems, and only about 25 percent of agencies confirmed to OMB that they are prepared to identify and thoroughly assess signs of data breaches.\n\nThe effects of the shutdown extend even to agencies that were funded throughout, like the military and intelligence community, thanks to interdependencies and network connections between agencies.\n\nOne of the few public-facing impacts of the shutdown was that web encryption certificates for numerous federal websites expired during the weeks of pause. This meant that people trying to access the sites, like NASA\u2019s rocket testing portal, may have gotten warnings from their browsers that the pages were unsafe. Other sites became completely inaccessible.\n\nThe shutdown could also become a sort of black hole of accountability for cybersecurity incidents.\n\nA bigger concern, though, is that the shutdown's true impact will take time to reckon with fully. Last week, Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar and five of her colleagues sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security and the NSA with questions about how federal cybersecurity posture fared during the shutdown. \"Experts have warned that our reduced capacity for cybersecurity during shutdowns provides an opportunity for adversaries and cybercriminals,\" the senators wrote. \"We are concerned that these circumstances have left our government and citizens vulnerable to cyberattacks.\" DHS and the NSA have not yet responded to the senators' questions.\n\nDigital threats, particularly those from nation state hackers, are not just a theoretical concern for the federal government. China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia all have active espionage and offensive hacking capabilities and many were ramping up their activity in the last year anyway, before the federal shutdown potentially created an opportunity for unchecked probing and intrusion. Such a prolonged stretch of reduced oversight would be virtually irresistible to foreign adversaries.\n\nThe shutdown also undermined the government's reputation as a stable and reliable employer\u2014a crucial issue given the general dearth of qualified cybersecurity personnel nationwide and the ongoing difficulty of competing with private sector jobs. Security professionals say that the shutdown was a prime recruiting season for private firms, and that many government employees and contractors left or plan to leave for other positions. New federal employment numbers haven't been released yet.\n\n\"Government employees have been busier than ever,\" says Carlos Perez, head of research and development at the IT security firm TrustedSec. \"Many are leaving so far.\"\n\nLEARN MORE The WIRED Guide to Data Breaches\n\nAttackIQ's Kennedy notes that the shutdown could also become a sort of black hole of accountability for cybersecurity incidents that began before, during, or even months after the break\u2014a disturbing idea given ongoing issues with holding agencies to account for cybersecurity lapses.\n\nThe only potential silver lining? The risk management firm SecurityScorecard suggests that threats like spearphishing may have been less effective during the shutdown, since furloughed employees literally weren't in the office to check their email.\n\nThough government employees and contractors who were furloughed have now spent more than two weeks rebuilding from the shutdown, it will be months or even years before the full toll of the incident is understood. And if another shutdown comes next week, count on erasing whatever little progress has been made.\n\nUpdated 2-11-19, 10:30 am ET: This story incorrectly identified Christopher Kennedy as CISO at RiskIQ; he has that position at AttackIQ.\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories"

    "text": "Roger Stone\u2019s pre-dawn arrest in Florida Friday, a raid executed by FBI agents working without salary during the government shutdown, had long seemed a matter of when, not if. Special counsel Robert Mueller has been deeply interested in Stone for months, and at least nine of the political operative\u2019s associates have appeared before Mueller\u2019s grand jury, including talk-radio host Randy Credico and conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi. Stone himself has been saying for nearly a year that he expected to be indicted, as his own public statements over more than two years have placed him at the center of the question of whether the Trump campaign conspired, colluded, or cooperated with WikiLeaks or Russia to leak stolen Democratic emails during the summer and fall of 2016.\n\nWith Friday\u2019s seven-count indictment against Stone, Mueller is again edging closer to answering yes, although he notably stops short of alleging any conspiracy during the campaign. You can read the full document embedded below.\n\nThe indictment details several incriminating messages allegedly sent by Stone, some of which had previously been laid out in the aborted plea agreement with Corsi. But it also delivers four significant pieces of specific new allegations about the Trump campaign, Stone, and WikiLeaks:\n\nStone allegedly communicated directly with the Trump campaign about the Wikileaks email dumps. As the indictment lays out: \u201cAfter the July 22, 2016 release of stolen DNC emails by [Wikileaks], a senior Trump Campaign official was directed to contact STONE about any additional releases and what other damaging information [Wikileaks] had regarding the Clinton Campaign. STONE thereafter told the Trump Campaign about potential future releases of damaging material.\u201d A key\u2014and genuinely surprising\u2014phrase in that allegation is the fact that Mueller says the Trump campaign official was \u201cdirected\u201d to contact Stone, a level of specificity beyond saying simply that a Trump campaign official contacted Stone.\n\nInstead, Mueller is making clear he has specific evidence of the decision-making process inside the Trump campaign and evidence that someone\u2014who goes unnamed in the indictment but whose name Mueller surely knows\u2014directed \u201ca senior Trump Campaign official\u201d to contact Stone. There are only so many people who could \u201cdirect\u201d a senior campaign official to take an action, as opposed to some more mundane verb like \u201casked\u201d or \u201csuggested\u201d that could imply a peer or lesser official.\n\nThe Trump campaign appreciated Stone\u2019s work with WikiLeaks. Later in the indictment, Mueller says that on October 7, 2016\u2014the day the infamous Access Hollywood tape came out, and was almost immediately buried in news coverage by WikiLeaks\u2019 first dump of John Podesta\u2019s stolen emails\u2014an \u201cassociate of the high-ranking Trump Campaign official sent a text message to STONE that read \u2018well done.\u2019 In subsequent conversations with senior Trump Campaign officials, STONE claimed credit for having correctly predicted the October 7, 2016 release.\u201d It\u2019s long been an open question whether the WikiLeaks dump was coordinated to distract from the Access Hollywood tape, and while Mueller\u2019s indictment stops short of weighing in one way or another, it seems the Trump campaign certainly appreciated Stone\u2019s apparent work coordinating the distraction.\n\nStone was fishing for specific damaging information. Another key question around the Russian email dumps is how much coordination or communication had gone back and forth between the Trump side and WikiLeaks. Mueller\u2019s indictment alleges at least one specific conversation in which Stone asked Wikileaks for specific stolen emails. Through a combination of text messages and emails on September 18, 2016, Stone appears to have asked Credico, who was allegedly serving as what Mueller calls a \u201cgo-between\u201d for Stone and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, to inquire about a specific damaging article published about Hillary Clinton\u2019s time as secretary of state: \u201cPlease ask [Assange] for any State or HRC e-mail from August 10 to August 30\u2014particularly on August 20, 2011 that mention [the subject of the article] or confirm this narrative.\u201d In weighing whether a conspiracy exists, there\u2019s obviously a world of difference between being the passive recipient of knowledge and digging for specific damaging allegations to help your campaign.\n\nMueller has a new ally: A Democratic House of Representatives. Stone\u2019s indictment focuses on false statements made to the House Intelligence Committee, transcripts presumably turned over recently by new Democratic chair Adam Schiff. It also says that Stone attempted to coerce Credico to stonewall or even lie to the committee, allegedly telling him to \"do a 'Frank Pentangeli,'\" a reference to a character in Godfather II who testifies before Congress and claims not to know information that he actually does. According to Mueller's indictment, Stone even threatened Randy Credico's therapy dog, Bianca, who, as far as we know, is the only dog who has appeared before Mueller's grand jury so far, having attended Credico's testimony last fall.\n\nIn the weeks following last fall\u2019s guilty plea by Michael Cohen for lying to Congress, Schiff had said he suspected other witnesses before the House committee had lied, and that he intended to turn over those transcripts to Mueller when he assumed the chairmanship from Republican representative Devin Nunes, who had long stonewalled and undermined the House investigation. It\u2019s the first public sign that turning over those transcripts may have contributed to Mueller indictments\u2014but given the hints from Schiff, it may not be the last.\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories\n\nGarrett M.

    "title": "Trump's Missile Defense Plan Creates More Problems Than It Solves",
    "text": "The threat of a nuclear missile strike on United States soil has felt more tangible over the past few years, thanks to North Korea's intercontinental ballistic missile testing and oscillating relationships between the two countries. Against that backdrop, President Donald Trump announced plans on Thursday for the next generation of missile defense on land, sea\u2014and in space.\n\nThe Missile Defense Review describes creating capabilities to stop an array of long-range missiles, including those that are hypersonic, or travel faster than the speed of sound. The assessment also discusses more radical ideas, like capabilities that could neutralize a missile anywhere in the world during its initial ascent, space-based tracking and interception technologies, and even high-energy lasers mounted on \"airborne platforms.\"\n\nAnywhere, Any Time, Any Place\n\nAnd while Trump described a comprehensive, airtight vision of missile defense in his remarks, analysts say the administration's actual report is more of a survey of all possible avenues, from realistic, incremental next steps to unlikely moon shots.\n\n\"It would be technically unachievable, and economically ruinous if you tried.\" Laura Grego, Union of Concerned Scientists\n\n\"Our goal is simple: to ensure that we can detect and destroy any missile launched against the United States\u2014anywhere, any time, any place,\" Trump said in prepared remarks Thursday. But analysts agree that such guarantees are currently technologically impossible. In practice, the only realistic steps are those that build on existing technologies and infrastructure. Pursuing a broader array of the initiatives outlined in the report would be prohibitively expensive. Not to mention that the more the US discusses and pursues elaborate defenses, the more it may provoke rivals like China and Russia to respond by bolstering their offensive capabilities.\n\n\"My general take on this is that it\u2019s very much a continuation and consistent with the Obama administration\u2019s approach,\" says John Plumb, a senior engineer at Rand who served as the principal director for nuclear and missile defense policy at the Pentagon during the Obama administration. \"It's a cost-unconstrained review, a no-stone-unturned approach. Fully funded, this would be a tremendous amount of money. But it will not be fully funded.\"\n\nAmong the more realistic proposals: an expansion of ground-based interceptors in Alaska to protect against short-range missiles. The Obama administration brought the number of these interceptors from 30 to 44; the Trump administration suggests a new total of 60. Developing defenses against cruise missiles\u2014which enter the atmosphere for part of their flight\u2014and ultrasonic missiles, as the review suggests, are also logical evolutions. Even developing sensor arrays in space to detect and track missiles, as sci-fi as it sounds, could potentially be achieved off of existing technology.\n\nBut in thinking about the next generation of antimissile technologies, it's important to keep in mind that current missile-defense systems aren't particularly reliable, especially against long-range weapons that travel at high speed. This is why tempting ideas like laser interceptors remain so far off. The Defense Department needs to make sure today's defenses work before it can focus on tomorrow's.\n\nSticker Shock\n\nAnd then there's the cost. The US has worked to develop missile-defense capabilities in fits and starts for decades, particularly since the \"Star Wars\" antimissile proposals of the Reagan administration. Current defenses have already run up hundreds of billions of dollars in expense, and critics of this latest appraisal say that even tackling its more realistic aspects would be irresponsibly costly.\n\n\"The main significance of the review is that it changes the program from a limited, regional defense system to an unlimited, global defense system. That is simple to say\u2014it is impossible to do,\" says John Tierney, the executive director of the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation and a former member of the House of Representatives. \"The track record and history of ballistic-missile defense in the Department of Defense is one of hype and promise followed by deployment of very limited capability. I expect we\u2019re seeing that pattern repeat itself.\"\n\nAnalysts agreed that the combined cost of all the ideas described in the report would be astronomical. Laura Grego, a senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, pointed out that the US has spent more than $70 billion on ground-based interceptor systems alone already. Joe Cirincione, president of the anti-proliferation Ploughshares Fund, suggested that a ballpark for the President's proposals would be $1 trillion. \"It would be technically unachievable and economically ruinous if you tried,\" Grego told reporters on Thursday.*\n\n\"If you liked the president\u2019s border wall, wait until you see the space wall.\" Joe Cirincione, Ploughshares Fund\n\nDefense systems also cost more to establish than offensive improvements; analysts noted on Thursday that the Trump administration's report could spark an escalation with countries like China and Russia. A comprehensive report on missile defense is obviously not in itself unreasonable, especially given that the last US government report of this kind came in 2010. But analysts warn that the broad and vague nature of the report, combined with Trump's sweeping announcement, could rankle adversaries.\n\nFor example, the US's Terminal High Altitude Area Defense antimissile system on loan to South Korea has added a significant layer of tension in its conversations with North Korea and China. Meanwhile, in his 2018 State of the Union address last March, Russian president Vladimir Putin said that Russia has consistently cautioned the US against building missile-defense infrastructure that could be interpreted as shifting the balance of power in nuclear deterrence. \u201cNobody listened to us,\" he said. \"Listen now.\u201d To be clear, Russia and China have also developed and plan to expand their own antimissile technologies.\n\nThe report also comes during a historically long government shutdown, and the Trump administration has only an acting secretary of defense after James Mattis' departure several weeks ago. Congress has seemed willing in recent years to allocate funds for missile spending, including $10.3 billion that was already approved for fiscal year 2019. But Trump faces a Democrat-controlled house that may not be inclined to approve much more, especially given how unproven even existing missile-defense technology is.\n\nAll of which means that it's unclear what will come out of the Missile Defense Review. For many of the more far-fetched technologies, like space and drone interceptors, the report simply proposes more studies rather than concrete steps. But critics worry that the document's lack of specificity actually leaves room for the administration to introduce even more of what they see as costly and distracting initiatives.\n\n\"If you liked the president\u2019s border wall,\" Ploughshares Fund's Cirincione says, \"wait until you see the space wall.\"\n\nUpdated February 5, 2019 12:30pm ET to clarify cost estimates.\n\nMore Great WIRED Stories"

    "title": "It\u2019s Time to Rethink Who\u2019s Best Suited for Space Travel",
    "text": "In 1961, a college student named David Myers traveled from Washington, DC, to the US Naval School of Aviation Medicine in Florida to take part in a new experiment. \u201cI had a very limited understanding of what I was getting myself into,\u201d Myers told me recently over email. \u201cSo I was extremely curious and mildly excited that first day.\u201d Myers was one of 11 men specifically recruited by Dr. Ashton Graybiel to help test the feasibility of human spaceflight, at a time when nobody knew whether the human body could withstand a trip beyond our atmosphere. For nearly a decade, the US Navy put 11 men through countless tests. Four of the men spent 12 straight days inside a 20-foot room that rotated constantly. In another experiment, they were sent out to notoriously rough seas off the coast of Nova Scotia. On the boat, the men played cards while the researchers were so overcome with seasickness that they had to cancel the test and go home. Others were sent up in the so-called \u201cVomit Comet,\u201d an aircraft designed to simulate zero gravity. That\u2019s the test Myers is still most fond of. \u201cThis free floating was a fascinating experience,\u201d he says. \u201cNo other tests came close as my favorites.\u201d But Myers and the other men would never go to space. In fact, they would never be allowed. They were recruited for these tests for the exact reason they would never pass the NASA astronaut qualification exams: All 11 men were deaf. Rose Eveleth is an Ideas contributor at WIRED and the creator and host of Flash Forward, a podcast about possible (and not so possible) futures. Now known as the Gallaudet Eleven, Myers and his colleagues were recruited from Gallaudet College (now Gallaudet University), a school for d/Deaf students. (\u201cBig D\u201d Deaf refers to Deaf culture and community, while \u201csmall d\u201d deaf refers to people who don\u2019t identify with that community.) Ten out of the 11 men had become deaf because of spinal meningitis, an infection of the fluid in the spinal cord. The infection ultimately damaged each man\u2019s inner ear, including their vestibular system, which also happens to be the system that is mainly responsible for motion sickness. This made the men perfect test subjects for a space program that was trying to understand what might happen to people in places where the inner ear can\u2019t sense up and down. \u201cThrough their endurance and dedication, the work of the Gallaudet Eleven made substantial contributions to the understanding of motion sickness and adaptation to spaceflight,\u201d wrote Hannah Hotovy of the NASA History Division. Harry Larson, another one of the Gallaudet Eleven, put it this way: \u201cWe were different in a way they needed.\u201d It\u2019s no secret that it\u2019s incredibly difficult to become an astronaut. NASA\u2019s selection process is notoriously rigorous\u2014strict enough that it was the most plausible kind of place to set the movie Gattaca, where only the perfectly genetically engineered get to board rockets bound for space. Writer Tom Wolfe documented the space program\u2019s strenuous astronaut training program in his book The Right Stuff. The assumption has long been that this training is a necessity\u2014traveling to space is a mentally and physically grueling endeavor. We need the strongest, smartest, most adaptable among us to go. But strength comes in many forms, as do smarts. And if you want to find people who are the very best at adapting to worlds not suited for them, you\u2019ll have the best luck looking at people with disabilities, who navigate such a world every single day. Which has led disability advocates to raise the question: What actually is the right stuff?\n\n\"Crip bodies were built for space travel. Crip minds already push the outer limits,\u201d Alice Wong, founder of the Disability Visibility Project, tweeted last year. \u201cWe already master usage of breathing apparatuses and can handle challenging situations.\u201d Wong went on to coedit an issue of the literary magazine Deaf Poets Society called \u201cCrips in Space\u201d with writer and performer Sam de Leve. Take, for example, people who use ostomy bags. Right now, pooping in space is actually an important technical challenge. During takeoff, landing, and spacewalks, astronauts wear diapers. While in the space station, they use a toilet that requires a fair amount of precision and training to use. Astronauts have told all kinds of stories about rogue poop, or situations in which the toilet has backed up or generally gone awry. In 2008, NASA spent $19 million on a Russian toilet for the International Space Station. None of this would be an issue for an astronaut with an ostomy bag. \u201cI could plug into the wall and just empty the container that\u2019s been collecting,\u201d says Mallory K. Nelson, a disability design specialist who uses an ileostomy bag\u2014a pouch that connects to her intestine and collects waste. \u201cI\u2019ve moved the output location of poop, which creates a lot more flexibility in the kind of systems I can have. I could attach it to a space suit.\u201d All the various devices and ways of moving the body in space are likely more familiar to people with disabilities than to able-bodied people. Or consider movement in space. You\u2019ve certainly seen videos of astronauts zipping around the space station using their arms and legs to push off surfaces and direct their motion. This is a type of movement that people who use wheelchairs and other mobility aids are already familiar with. In fact, the various devices and ways of moving the body in space are likely more familiar to people with disabilities than to able-bodied people. \u201cWe move our bodies in so many different ways, and the disabled community has an exuberant amount of options,\u201d says Nelson, who is an amputee and who has used crutches, a wheelchair, a scooter, and a prosthetic to get around. Nelson even coined a term for this recently: transmobility, the idea that there are lots of ways to get around besides putting one foot in front of the other. Nelson also points out that most astronauts have no prior experience relying on technology for their movement and lives, whereas people with disabilities do so every day. In a space suit, for a space walk, an astronaut has to be trained in how to move their body in unison with a piece of technology. They have to get used to the idea that, if that technology should fail, they could be in grave danger. This, again, is an experience people like Nelson live with every day. \u201cI\u2019m always moving my body in motion with another object. That\u2019s all we do,\u201d Nelson says. Or take blind astronauts. In a piece for Scientific American, Sheri Wells-Jensen lays out the case for designing spaceships for blind space travelers: \u201cAfter all, in a serious accident, the first thing to go might be the lights! This generally means that the first thing a sighted astronaut must do for security is ensure visual access to the environment. He hunts for a flashlight, and if emergency lighting comes on, his eyes take a moment to adjust. Meanwhile, the blind astronaut is already heading toward the source of the problem. In the fire aboard the Russian Mir space station, in 1997, the crew struggled as smoke obscured their view. The blind astronaut, while still affected by the lack of good air, would not be bothered by either dim lighting or occluding smoke. She would accurately direct the fire extinguisher at the source of heat and noise.\u201d In the Mir fire that Wells-Jensen mentions, one of the problems that arose was the sighted astronauts\u2019 inability to locate the fire extinguisher through the smoke. Had the ship been laid out with a blind participant in mind, there would have been a nonvisual signal already built in to such a critical piece of equipment. Or consider d/Deaf astronauts once again. The Gallaudet Eleven were tapped for their immunity to motion sickness\u2014John Glenn even reportedly said he was envious of their ability to withstand the tests without getting sick\u2014but there are other reasons why bringing a d/Deaf astronaut along could be useful. \u201cStudies have shown that using sign languages confers cognitive advantages in one's visual working memory, enhancing how we see, remember, and manipulate objects in our mind,\u201d says Joseph Murray, a professor at Gallaudet University and the scholar behind the term Deaf Gain, the idea that deafness should not be considered a loss of something but, rather, a gain of a whole host of other things. \u201cThe challenge Deaf Gain offers for NASA and all workplaces is to rethink their automatic assumptions about deaf people's capabilities,\u201d Murray says. \u201cIf there is a mission need for people with advanced spatial processing skills who do not get motion sick, then there are quite a few deaf people ready and willing to serve.\u201d And it\u2019s not just on a trip to space that people with disabilities might have an advantage. Take a situation in which astronauts are going somewhere to settle: Able bodies might no longer behave the way we expect. \u201cHumans have an environmental niche on Earth, like all other creatures do, and we exploit it in different ways,\u201d says Ashley Shew, a professor at Virginia Tech. Mars, or even a space station, is nothing like that niche. \u201cThe conditions in which our bodies have grown up are so drastically different that our existence in space will be much more like being a disabled person on Earth than like being an abled person on Earth.\u201d Who better to send than those who are used to navigating environments not built for them\u2014those who experience that every day on Earth? \u201cDisabled people will fare better in space because disabled people have learned to negotiate hostile situations in ways that able bodied people are completely unaware of,\u201d Shew says. Wong agrees. \u201cThe way we communicate, function, and exist with our diverse bodyminds sets us up as ideal space explorers and ambassadors of Earth, ready to make first contact with sentient beings,\u201d she told me."

The FCC said today that it was reactivating the Equipment Authorization System, reversing a decision announced on January 2nd. Several other FCC services will remain unavailable, and the FCC isn\u2019t offering support staff for the system until after the shutdown ends.\n\nMany electronics must receive FCC certification before going to market, and a prolonged closure could theoretically push back their release. Last week, the Telecommunications Industry Association warned that phone carriers might have to slow the rollout of new 5G phones if the shutdown continued. The concern was particularly pressing because companies often announce new products around the Mobile World Congress convention, which takes place next month in Barcelona, Spain.\n\nAn industry group warned the shutdown would slow down 5G\u2019s rollout\n\nThe actual stakes of closing the system weren\u2019t clear-cut. \u201cI\u2019ve seen multiple industry groups complain that the government shutdown is going to slow down X, Y, or Z,\u201d said Jim Dunstan, general counsel at technology policy association TechFreedom, in response to questions from The Verge earlier this week. \u201cI view this as \u2018hedging bets\u2019 on the delivery of new products or services. If something gets delayed down the road, you can now blame it on the government shutdown.\u201d T-Mobile, Verizon, AT&T, and Samsung \u2014 some of the biggest companies likely to be affected by a delay \u2014 didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment from The Verge. And even the worst-case scenario paled against some other consequences of the government shutdown.\n\nThe authorization system is being reactivated today, so private Telecommunications Certification Bodies can use it to issue certifications for equipment they\u2019ve tested. These bodies still won\u2019t be able to certify products whose tests are \u201ccomplex or break new ground,\u201d since those require a consultation with FCC staff. But the TIA applauded the move. \u201cMost device approvals will be covered by today\u2019s action,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cTIA is very grateful to the Commission\u2019s leadership for recognizing the importance of this issue and taking swift action to address it.\u201d"

    "text": "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has issued an urgent call for government agencies to secure their web infrastructure in the midst of a partial government shutdown, as first reported by Cyberscoop. The department sent out an emergency directive on Tuesday afternoon, alerting government agencies to the threat and recommending agencies immediately secure their DNS records with two-factor authentication. But with much of the government still subject to the ongoing shutdown, it\u2019s unclear how quickly agencies can respond to the directive.\n\nDNS records are a central feature of the web, a kind of online phone book that connects URLs (like dhs.gov) to IP addresses (like 104.97.73.157). If an attacker can compromise those records, they can redirect the URL to an address they control, effectively hijacking the site without compromising any of the underlying infrastructure beyond the DNS entry. From there, attackers can use the hijacked site to seed malware or simply spread chaos, depending on their goals.\n\nBecause of the relative ease of the attack, DNS hijacking has been a popular tactic for politically motivated hackers. A group called the Syrian Electronic Army carried out a particularly successful campaign in 2013, hijacking The New York Times, The Guardian, and other sites. According to Cyberscoop, at least six government sites have been affected by recent DNS attacks, making the move particularly urgent.\n\nThe security problem is made worse by the ongoing government shutdown, which has hit the Department of Homeland Security particularly hard. Paychecks are still on hold for 800,000 federal workers in total, including workers from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and Citizenship and Immigration Services."

    "text": "Over two dozen technology and human rights organizations published an open letter to congressional leaders this morning requesting that they refuse to fund any \u201cinvasive surveillance technology\u201d at the southern border.\n\nA border wall was a significant part of President Trump\u2019s campaign platform, and over the past few weeks, the White House has put increasing pressure on Congress to deliver funding for the wall. Last month, the nation\u2019s longest government shutdown was put to an end after President Trump and Democrats agreed to open the government for an additional three weeks, allowing for them to discuss border funding without leaving hundreds of thousands of government employees without a paycheck.\n\n\u201cWe do not believe that additional funding is needed to further fund border technology.\u201d\n\nAfter the stop-gap spending bill was approved, members of Congress have begun to discuss a potential deal that would not include funding for an all-encompassing southern border wall, but would support the use of technology as a substitute that some critics have argued is too invasive.\n\nIn the letter, groups like Fight for the Future, the American Civil Liberties Union, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation call on congressional leaders like House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) to not include funding for solutions like facial recognition tech or the collection of immigrant biometric or genetic data.\n\n\u201cThe House Democratic Conferees Proposal for Smart, Effective Border Security calls for funding various invasive surveillance technologies that would intrude on the liberties of travelers, immigrants, and people who live near the border,\u201d the coalition wrote. \u201cGiven that funding of border enforcement is already at a historic high, we do not believe that additional funding is needed to further fund border technology.\u201d\n\nThe deadline to approve funding for the fiscal year is quickly approaching. If the White House and Congress can\u2019t agree on a solution by February 15th, the government will shut down again.\n\nHomeland Security has been expanding the use of facial recognition tech at the border since Trump took office, largely in connection with the Biometric Exit mandate. Last year, US Customs and Border Protection began to fully implement a new system that scanned drivers\u2019 faces as they left the country. The same technology is being deployed at airports for visa holders and US citizens, which is seeking to verify a visa holder exits and to spot anyone traveling with fraudulent documents. In August, the system identified a Congolese national attempting to enter the country with false documents, one of the highest-profile impostorship cases to date."

    "title": "With cybersecurity threats looming, the government shutdown is putting America at risk",
    "text": "Putting political divisions and affiliations aside, the government partially shutting down for the third time over the last year is extremely worrisome, particularly when considering its impact on the nation\u2019s cybersecurity priorities. Unlike the government, our nation\u2019s enemies don\u2019t \u201cshut down.\u201d When our nation\u2019s cyber centers are not actively monitoring and protecting our most valuable assets and critical infrastructure, threats magnify and vulnerabilities become further exposed.\n\nWhile Republicans and Democrats continue to butt heads over border security, the vital agencies tasked with properly safeguarding our nation from our adversaries are stuck in operational limbo. Without this protection in full force acting around the clock, serious extraneous threats to government agencies and private businesses can thrive. This shutdown, now into its fourth week, has crippled key U.S. agencies, most notably the Department of Homeland Security, imperiling our nation\u2019s cybersecurity defenses.\n\nConsider the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which has seen nearly 37 percent of its staff furloughed. This agency leads efforts to protect and defend critical infrastructure, as it pertains to industries as varied as energy, finance, food and agriculture, transportation and defense.\n\nAs defined in the 2001 Patriot Act, critical infrastructure is such that, \u201cthe incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.\u201d In the interest of national security, we simply cannot tolerate prolonged vulnerability in these areas.\n\nEmployees who are considered \u201cessential\u201d are still on the job, but the loss of supporting staff could prove to be costly, in both the short and long term. More immediately, the shutdown places a greater burden on the employees deemed essential enough to stick around. These employees are tasked with both longer hours and expanded responsibilities, leading to a higher risk of critical oversight and mission failure, as weary agents find themselves increasingly stretched beyond their capabilities.\n\nThe long-term effects, however, are quite frankly, far more alarming. There\u2019s a serious possibility our brightest minds in cybersecurity will consider moving to the private sector following a shutdown of this magnitude. Even ignoring that the private sector pays better, furloughed staff are likely to reconsider just how valued they are in their current roles. After the 2013 shutdown, a significant segment of the intelligence community left their posts for the relative stability of corporate America. The current shutdown bears those risks as well. A loss of critical personnel could result in institutional failure far beyond the present shutdown, leading to cascading security deterioration.\n\nThis shutdown has farther-reaching effects for the federal government to attract talent in the form of recent college grads or those interested in transitioning from the private sector. The stability of government was once viewed as a guarantee compared to the private sector, but work could incentivize workers to take their talents to the private sector.\n\nThe IRS in particular is extremely vulnerable, putting America\u2019s private sector and your average taxpayer directly in the cross-hairs. The shutdown has come at the worst time of the year, as the holidays and the post-holiday season tend to have the highest rates for cybercrime. In 2018, the IRS reported a 60 percent increase in email scams. Meanwhile, as the IRS furloughed much of its staff as well, cyber criminals are likely to ramp up their activity even more.\n\nThough the agency has stated it will recall a \u201csignificant portion\u201d of its personnel to work without pay, it has also indicated there will be a lack of support for much beyond essential service. There\u2019s no doubt cybercriminals will see this as a lucrative opportunity. With tax season on the horizon, the gap in oversight will feed directly into cyber criminals\u2019 playing the field, undoubtedly resulting in escalating financial losses due to tax identity theft and refund fraud.\n\nCyberwarfare is no longer some distant afterthought, practiced and discussed by a niche group of experts in a back room. Cyberwarfare has taken center stage on the virtual battlefield. Geopolitical adversaries such as North Korea, Russia, Iran and China rely on cyber as their most agile and dangerous weapon against the United States. These hostile nation-states salivate at the idea of a prolonged government shutdown.\n\nFrom Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election to Chinese state cybercriminals breaching Marriott Hotels, the necessity to protect our national cybersecurity has never been more explicit.\n\nIf our government doesn\u2019t resolve this dilemma quickly, America\u2019s cybersecurity will undoubtedly suffer serious deterioration, inevitably endangering the lives and safety of citizens across the nation. This issue goes far beyond partisan politics, yet needs both parties to come to a consensus immediately. Time is not on our side."

    "title": "Judge orders net neutrality lawsuit to go ahead despite shutdown",
    "text": "This week the possibility emerged that the ongoing government shutdown could delay net neutrality\u2019s day in court \u2014 but the court was not sympathetic to the FCC\u2019s request that the lawsuit be put off. Oral arguments for this major challenge to the agency\u2019s rollback of 2015\u2019s internet regulations will go ahead as planned on February 1.\n\nDuring a shutdown, federal employees \u2014 including government lawyers \u2014 must have specific authorization to continue working, since it\u2019s illegal for them to do so without pay. In this case a judge on the case must effectively make that authorization.\n\nThe FCC is among the many agencies and organizations affected by the shutdown, and many employees are stuck at home. As such it requested a postponement of an upcoming court date at which it and several companies and advocacy groups are scheduled to argue over its rollback of net neutrality.\n\nA counter-argument filed immediately by industry group INCOMPAS pointed out that during previous shutdowns, the court had not granted such requests and should stick to that precedent.\n\nThe judges of the D.C. Circuit Appeals Court appear to agree with the latter argument; the FCC\u2019s motion was denied and arguments will go forward as planned on February 1.\n\nThis is definitely not good news for the FCC. While it no doubt has its ducks in a row as far as defending its net neutrality rollback and new rules in court (it has done so before and will again), it\u2019s far from ideal that the case will take place after a prolonged absence of all the pertinent experts from their posts. Briefing the lawyers, updating arguments, responding to industry concerns \u2014 it\u2019s not easy to do when all your staff is sitting at home watching \u201cBandersnatch\u201d over and over.\n\nThe lawsuit against the FCC has lots of good points to make about the rules it has established and the process by which it approved those rules, so this is no mere formality or frivolous suit. And net neutrality champions are likely happy to hear that they may very well catch the agency flat-footed."

    "title": "VC funding of cybersecurity companies hits record $5.3B in 2018",
    "text": "2018 wasn\u2019t all bad. It turned out to be a record year for venture capital firms investing in cybersecurity companies.\n\nAccording to new data out by Strategic Cyber Ventures, a cybersecurity-focused investment firm with a portfolio of four cybersecurity companies, more than $5.3 billion was funneled into companies focused on protecting networks, systems and data across the world, despite fewer deals done during the year.\n\nThat\u2019s up from 20 percent \u2014 $4.4 billion \u2014 from 2017, and up from close to double on 2016.\n\nPart of the reason was several \u201cmega\u201d funding rounds, according to the company. Last year saw some of the big eight companies getting bigger, amassing a total of $1.3 billion in funding last year. That includes Tanium\u2019s combined $375 million investment, Anchorfree\u2019s $295 million and CrowdStrike\u2019s $200 million.\n\nAccording to the report, North America leads the rest of the world with $4 billion in VC funding, with Europe and Asia neck-and-neck at around $550 million each, but growing year-over-year.\n\nIn fact, according to the data, California \u2014 where many of the big companies have their headquarters \u2014 accounts for nearly half of all VC funding in cybersecurity in 2018. By comparison, only about $300 million went to the \u201cgovernment\u201d region \u2014 including Maryland, Virginia and Washington, DC, where many government-backed or focused companies are located.\n\n\u201cAs DC residents, we have to think there is more the city could do to entice cybersecurity companies to establish their headquarters in the city,\u201d the firm said. Virtru, an email encryption and data privacy firm, drove the only funding of cybersecurity investment in Washington, DC last year, they added.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this trend in the broader tech ecosystem as well, with many, large international funds and investment outside of the U.S.,\u201d the firm said. \u201cSimply put, amazing and valuable technology companies are being created outside of the U.S.\u201d\n\nLooking ahead, Tanium and CrowdStrike are highly anticipated to IPO this year \u2014 so long as the markets hold stable.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still unclear what the public equity markets have in store in 2019,\u201d the firm said. \u201cA few weeks in and we\u2019re already experiencing a government shutdown, trade wars with China, and expected slow down in global economic growth.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, only time will tell what 2019 has in store,\u201d the firm concluded."

    "title": "Shutdown could delay challenge of FCC\u2019s net neutrality rollback",
    "text": "Update: Unfortunately for the FCC, the judge has denied its motion to postpone.\n\nThe ongoing shutdown of the federal government has already had adverse effects on millions nationwide, and now could even delay a major legal challenge to the FCC\u2019s infamous net neutrality repeal. The agency moved yesterday to delay oral arguments scheduled for just two weeks from now.\n\nThe arguments in a consolidated lawsuit against the FCC led by the likes of Mozilla, Vimeo and industry group INCOMPAS were set to begin on February 1. But of course no one could have predicted a record-setting government shutdown (well \u2014 some might have). That has serious implications in a case taking place in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nIn a court filing, the FCC explained its position:\n\n\u2026Due to the recent lapse in funding for the FCC and the relevant component of the Department of Justice, the Commission believes that, in an abundance of caution, it should move for an extension to ensure that attorneys may fully prepare for argument consistent with the Antideficiency Act\u2026\n\nThat Act essentially prohibits the government from operating without adequate funding, which in this case includes U.S. legal counsel who would arguably be working without pay.\n\nHowever, as you can imagine, there are plenty of federal court cases that can\u2019t be delayed, and in those cases a judge can authorize the continued involvement of the federal lawyers and things will proceed. (This is all an extreme simplification, but sufficient for our purposes today.)\n\nThe FCC argues, not without reason, that arguments should be postponed; the Department of Justice did issue blanket guidance earlier that civil cases like this one should in general be put off.\n\nINCOMPAS, however, quickly filed an opposition to this idea, pointing out that the court had in previous cases denied similar requests:\n\n\u2026When federal appropriations lapsed in 2013, resulting in a \u2018shutdown\u2019 from October 1 to October 17, 2013, the court received Government motions to stay oral argument in at least sixteen cases. Every one of these motions was denied; and every time, the Government then participated in oral argument.\n\nIt\u2019s down to the judge to determine whether the case is urgent enough to authorize federal counsel to work during the shutdown. If it decides to delay, it could be weeks or months before it is rescheduled.\n\nA quick response is requested, as whichever decision the judge makes, both sides will need to be ready to accommodate it. I\u2019ll update this post if I hear a decision is reached."

After a couple of years of back and forths, the manufacturing giant says it\u2019s recommitting to plans for a plant in the upper Midwest. A statement today cited a phone call between chairman/founder Terry Gou and Donald Trump.\n\n\u201cAfter productive discussions between the White House and the company, and after a personal conversation between President Donald J. Trump and Chairman Terry Gou, Foxconn is moving forward with our planned construction of a Gen 6 fab facility, which will be at the heart of the Wisconsin Valley Science and Technology Park,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cThis campus will serve both as an advanced manufacturing facility as well as a hub of high technology innovation for the region.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, the company noted that it was reconsidering its plans for the TV plant, noting that it was more interested in hiring researchers and engineers than the manufacturing jobs that were initially noted. \u201cIn terms of TV, we have no place in the U.S.,\u201d Gou said at the time. \u201cWe can\u2019t compete.\u201d\n\nAn influx of manufacturing jobs would be a win for Trump at a vital time, as support has eroded over the country\u2019s longest government shutdown and tariffs have made for icy relations with China. As CNBC notes, state government has sweetened the deal considerably with $4 billion in tax breaks.\n\nInitial plans for the 20 million-square-foot campus, unveiled at a White House event in 2017, noted that it would bring 13,000 jobs \u2014 a nice bump as the U.S. has struggled to maintain manufacturing facilities.\n\nDetails, however, are still pretty thin.\n\n\u201cOur decision is also based on a recent comprehensive and systematic evaluation to help determine the best fit for our Wisconsin project among TFT technologies,\u201d the statement continues. \u201cWe have undertaken the evaluation while simultaneously seeking to broaden our investment across Wisconsin far beyond our original plans to ensure the company, our workforce, the local community, and the state of Wisconsin will be positioned for long-term success.\u201d"

    "title": "A new ABC documentary and podcast about Theranos features never-before-aired depositions",
    "text": "The rise and fall of Theranos, the blood-testing company whose technology never worked despite its claims otherwise, has already been covered extensively. Most notably, the two-time Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who broke open the story of Theranos\u2019s secrets and lies, John Carreyrou, went on to author a best-selling book about the saga in \u201cBad Blood.\u201d\n\nStill, with Theranos founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes continuing to face criminal charges that she knowingly defrauded investors, along with Theranos\u2019s former president and COO (and Holmes\u2019s longtime lover) Ramesh \u201cSunny\u201d Balwani, the company and the pair\u2019s trajectory remain a point of fascination for many.\n\nA new documentary produced by ABC\u2019s \u201cNightline\u201d \u2014 along with a six-part podcast series whose first episode is being released today (the others will be pushed out every Wednesday through February\u2019s end) \u2014 will undoubtedly stoke even more questions about how investors and customers like Walgreens bought the act in the first place.\n\nSo we gathered after speaking yesterday with Rebecca Jarvis, ABC News\u2019s chief business, technology and economics correspondent, who led a three-year investigation into Theranos and Holmes, a Stanford drop-out who would go on to win acclaim as the youngest self-made female billionaire in the world before everything, very slowly, crashed down around her.\n\nSome outtakes from our chat with Jarvis follow, edited lightly for length. (Note that an air date has not yet been announced for the documentary, but ABC has begun running trailers.)\n\nTC: You\u2019ve been covering this story for years. Given all that you\u2019ve seen in the depositions that \u201cNightline\u201d plans to air as part of this documentary, and everything you\u2019ve learned in your reporting, who was the worse actor in all of this, Holmes or Balwani? John Carreyrou certainly painted him as a kind of Svengali figure.\n\nRJ: Most of what we\u2019ve seen publicly to this point have been official statements, or statements made in very nurturing environments, or interviews don\u2019t explicitly look at the technology itself. When we got access to these depositions \u2014 and it\u2019s hundreds of hours of footage \u2014 we couldn\u2019t believe our eyes, watching Elizabeth Holmes\u2019s deposition. It was just remarkable, hearing her having to answer to questions in a way that she\u2019d never had to previously.\n\nAs for [the way Holmes and Balwani operated], Tyler Schultz [a former employee who later became a whistleblower] has said, for example, that he was flagging things that were wrong to Elizabeth, and after he would flag a concern, she would react with a non-response. It was Sunny who became known as the enforcer, telling Tyler to watch himself and not to continue to raise these issues.\n\nTC: Are they open about their romantic relationship in the footage being aired?\n\nRJ: Yes. We\u2019ve never heard of them speak of it before, and viewers will see them talking about this relationship.\n\nTC: What was something in the many depositions you pored over that really took your breath away?\n\nRJ: One of the things that we heard over and over again, talking with various parties, including customers of Theranos, is that Elizabeth Holmes had told them that these Theranos-manufactured devices had been deployed in hospital rooms, emergency rooms and medevac helicopters among other places, and she\u2019s asked if this is accurate, and in every single case, the answer is no.\n\nNaturally, too, this whole thing was predicated on being able to run tests on a few drops of blood, and for the first time, you see Elizabeth having to answer questions about what the devices were really capable of. A lot of what comes up is how much of this was aspiration versus reality, and the great divide between those two things."

    "title": "Orbital Sculpture Stays Flaccid Due to Government Shutdown",
    "text": "Image: Trevor Paglen/Nevada Museum of Art\n\nAn inflatable space sculpture launched to orbit in December remains unfurled, in one of the more unanticipated consequences of the ongoing government shutdown in the United States.\n\n\n\nDesigned by U.S. artist Trevor Paglen, the Orbital Reflector was launched to low Earth orbit aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on December 3, 2018, along with dozens of other cubesats. But this $1.5 million art project, which also involved the Nevada Museum of Art, Spaceflight Industries, and Global Western, is now stuck in a holding pattern thanks to the U.S. government shutdown. With the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) out of commission, Paglen cannot get the required green light to unfurl his giant space balloon, as the New York Times reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOrbital Reflector is made from a lightweight material similar to mylar. When unfurled and fully inflated, the sculpture will attain an elongated diamond-like shape, roughly the length of a football field. A highly reflective coating of titanium dioxide means the sculpture should be visible to observers on the ground. Orbital Reflector wasn\u2019t meant to exist in space for very long, and it\u2019ll eventually fall into Earth\u2019s atmosphere and burn to crisp after a few months in orbit.\n\nThe purpose of the art project, according to its designer, is to encourage us \u201cto look up at the night sky with a renewed sense of wonder, to consider our place in the universe, and to reimagine how we live together on this planet.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the planning stages, Paglen had to go through the same channels as anyone else wanting to put something into orbit, namely acquiring a license from the FCC and abiding by regulations established by International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR). But now, with Trump\u2019s record-setting government shutdown, the project is stuck. Paglen cannot trigger the unfurl-and-inflate button until he receives clearance from the FCC. As the NYT reports, Paglen is worried that this anticipated wait could damage the structure:\n\n\n\nMr. Paglen said that [after the launch and deployment], his team did extensive \u201corbital analysis\u201d to ensure a collision-free trajectory and secure F.C.C. clearance to inflate. But communication from the F.C.C. soon ceased because of the shutdown. \u201cWhat we\u2019re concerned about,\u201d Mr. Paglen said, \u201cis that every time the satellite goes into sunlight, the entire thing heats up, and then in Earth\u2019s shadow it gets really cold and contracts. If you let this process go on too long, it can damage the electronics.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not designed to live indefinitely,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cWe would really like to deploy this.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOf course I feel bad for Paglen, but I must admit I\u2019m also feeling a bit of schadenfreude. I\u2019m not a fan of this sort of thing; surely looking up at the cosmos\u2014just the way it is, without an inflated shiny tube in the way\u2014should inspire in anyone a sense of wonder and contemplation of one\u2019s place in the universe. I also don\u2019t think low Earth orbit is an appropriate place for us to be depositing art projects, and it\u2019s starting to get a bit out of hand.\n\nThe same launch that delivered Orbital Reflector, for example, also deposited artist Tavares Strachan\u2019s Eonoch sculpture-satellite. Last year we had to endure Humanity Star, a small satellite bearing the resemblance of a disco ball. And not to be outdone, a Japanese firm launched a satellite into space last week that\u2019ll be capable of generating artificial meteor showers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSure, this might seem novel and cool (I personally don\u2019t think so), but we have to consider the costs. Bright objects in low Earth orbit, in addition to potentially interfering with astronomical observations, simply add to the massive collection of debris that could collide with and damage more useful satellites. Sadly, with the price of rocket launches dropping, there\u2019s likely more of this to come.\n\n[New York Times]"

    "text": "Photo: Getty\n\nThe two main agencies that are supposed to be helping monitor robocalls\u2014the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)\u2014halted operation 25 days ago because of the government shutdown. So how is that affecting the robocall plague?\n\nThe first noticeable change, as the Washington Post reported, was when the FTC stopped running the Do Not Call list. If you go to the FTC\u2019s National Do Not Call Registry site, you\u2019ll see it simply says, \u201cDue to the government shutdown, we are unable to offer this website service at this time.\u201d This of course means it\u2019s impossible to add a new number to the list.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut that\u2019s a list that legitimate operations respect. The type of spammers that have been ramping up over the last couple years generally disregard that list.\n\nLast year, a call blocker and monitor company First Orion projected that nearly half of U.S. calls in 2019 could be scam calls. But things have been looking up. In May, the FCC administered a $120 million fine to a robocall operator\u2014the first major crackdown on such an operation. In November, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai demanded that carriers begin adopting SHAKEN (Signature-based Handling of Asserted information using toKENs) and STIR (Secure Telephone Identity Revisited)\u2014technologies that will help customers and providers filter out calls from numbers that haven\u2019t been authenticated. And carriers are finally jumping on board.\n\nBut since the government has shut down, the FTC and FCC are no longer able to make moves against illegal spam call operations.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe inactivity of these agencies doesn\u2019t seem to be having a huge effect just yet. YouMail, a company that provides a robocall blocking service and monitors robocalls, has noticed that there has not been a significant uptick in robocalls since the shutdown.\u201cSo far this month, we\u2019re seeing robocalls roll along as the same 5 billion-ish pace we saw in Q4 [of 2018],\u201d YouMail CEO Alex Quilici told Gizmodo, adding the caveat that their numbers have been adjusted for the holidays, which cause an early-month lull.\n\nQuilici doesn\u2019t expect the shutdown to affect robocalls in the immediate future. But if the FTC and FCC were closed for a while, then that would affect enforcement of regulations that have been keeping robocallers somewhat at bay.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like if you take the cops off the beat long enough, the criminals will eventually notice, and the neighborhood will start seeing more crime,\u201d Quilici said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYouMail has noticed one immediate difference in the type of scam that robocallers are using\u2014scams that mention the government shutdown. He shared one recent message that the company documented:\n\nHello. I have an important update regarding your IRS tax debt. The recent government shut down is affecting your standing with the IRS and all those some IRS operations are down billing and collections remain active. So give me a call back at this number. I love a minute of your time to talk about how we are able to help. Thanks so much.\n\nThe FCC and FTC did not respond to a request for comment because they are closed due to the government shut down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[Washington Post]"

    "title": "Thousands of Workers at FDA and FAA Head Back to Work Without Pay to Inspect Food and Planes",
    "text": "Photo: Getty Images\n\nPresident Donald Trump seems to have figured out a solution to the government shutdown: Just make everybody work for free.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s day 26 of Trump\u2019s shutdown and the president still insists that he\u2019ll keep the government closed until he gets over $5 billion for his stupid wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. But airplanes aren\u2019t being inspected by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and food isn\u2019t being inspected by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Those agencies have now ordered furloughed staff back on the job. Those staff members just won\u2019t be getting a paycheck, much like workers at the TSA and the U.S. Coast Guard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Politico, the U.S. Department of Transportation ordered over 3,800 workers from the FAA back on the job yesterday to inspect planes. One thing Politico doesn\u2019t mention? The head of the Department of Transportation is Elaine Chao, wife of Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell. Oddly enough, Senator McConnell has the power to reopen the government if he simply stood up to President Trump took up the bills that have already been passed by the Democrat-controlled House to fund agencies like the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). But McConnell has repeatedly refused to do that.\n\nThe FDA is also ordering some of its staff back to the office, with roughly 400 people being called in to work for free. Scott Gottlieb, the head of the FDA, tweeted yesterday that the vast majority of the 400 being called back are inspectors and various staff to support food inspections.\n\n\u201cAbout 150 of 400 are focused on food inspections, rest are focused on other aspects of mission including medical devices (about 100 staff), drugs (about 70 staff) and biologics (90 staff),\u201d Gottlieb tweeted.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Department of the Interior also reportedly plans to bring back some workers soon because the shutdown is starting to affect the ability of offshore oil drillers to get permits. The Trump regime doesn\u2019t care about the integrity of the national parks or the health care of Native Americans, both of which are issues overseen by Interior and are suffering tremendously. But they do want to make sure that oil in the Gulf of Mexico can be extracted without a second of delay.\n\n\u201cFailure to hold these sales would have a negative impact to the Treasury and negatively impact investment in the U.S. Offshore Gulf of Mexico,\u201d the Interior Department said, according to Bloomberg News.\n\nThe IRS is also recalling thousands of workers in an effort to get tax refunds out the door on time. The agency\u2019s revised contingency plan was published yesterday and explains that over 46,000 IRS employees would be soon back at work without a paycheck. Refunds will go out but things like audits and phone support for those with tax question won\u2019t be happening.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRoughly 420,000 of the 800,000 government workers impacted by the shutdown are currently back at work. They\u2019re just not getting paid and are increasingly turning to public support and food shelves to survive. The number of government workers with GoFundMe accounts has skyrocketed since the beginning of the shutdown. And TSA workers in every corner of the country, from Tampa to Minneapolis to Denver, are all relying on food banks to feed their families.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting harder each day to get up at that time of the morning and leave my family when I\u2019m not getting paid for it,\u201d one TSA worker in Philadelphia told the local news.\n\nThis approach to governance is perfectly in line with the Trump method of business. He wants everything but he doesn\u2019t want to pay for it. Some people always said they wanted government to be run like a business. And now we get to see that philosophy in action."

    "text": "Photo: AP\n\nA northern California beach has been invaded by strange creatures. They awkwardly waddle with their long, slinky noses hung high. About 60 of them have been lounging on the sandy shores of the Point Reyes National Seashore near San Francisco with their mini-mes. These aren\u2019t any ordinary beasts\u2014they\u2019re elephant seals.\n\nThese marine mammals, whose males can weigh up to 4,400 pounds, have been chilling on this public beach since, well, no one\u2019s quite sure because park rangers weren\u2019t there to see them arrive. The park rangers discovered the colony, which had just gained 35 new pups, on Sunday when the park reopened following the end of a government shutdown that lasted a record-breaking 35 days, according to the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUsually, elephant seals are out of sight taking refuge on a separate beach with 100-foot-tall cliffs. However, high tides and stormy weather may have attracted them to this new empty beach nearby. They trampled down a fence to reach it and called it home. With all the park employees out of work, no one was there to discourage this hunkering down.\n\nPhoto: Getty\n\nNow the park crew will have a tough time trying to move these gentle giants. So they\u2019re not. They\u2019re keeping the road closed to protect the not-so-little seal families. In the 1800s, elephant seals were believed extinct from commercial hunting. They\u2019re now protected as all marine mammals are but face threats from fishing gear and ship traffic.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPark officials are considering offering guided tours so that the public can bear witness to these extraordinary animals. That sounds a lot easier than getting the seals to move. Thank you, government shutdown, for this one delight.\n\n[San Francisco Chronicle]"

Major airports are already seeing security checkpoint closures, with many more potentially to follow. Safety inspectors and federal cyber security staff are not back on the job at pre-shutdown levels, and those not on furlough are working without pay,\u201d they wrote.\n\n\u201cLast Saturday, TSA management announced that a growing number of officers cannot come to work due to the financial toll of the shutdown,\u201d they continued. \u201cIn addition, we are not confident that system-wide analyses of safety reporting data, which is used to identify and implement corrective actions in order to reduce risks and prevent accidents is 100 percent operational due to reduced FAA resources.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrighteningly, the groups added: \u201cIn our risk averse industry, we cannot even calculate the level of risk currently at play, nor predict the point at which the entire system will break. It is unprecedented.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe statement was issued by the presidents of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA), the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), and Association of Flight Attendants-CWA (AFA).\n\nThe groups have repeatedly warned that the shutdown could accelerate the retirement plans of roughly 20 percent of the nation\u2019s air traffic controllers. Should that happen, the nation\u2019s aviation system \u201cwill be crippled,\u201d they said.\n\n\u201cSomewhere out there is a breaking point. I don\u2019t know where it is,\u201d said former TSA Administrator Peter Neffenger, speaking to a congressional panel on Thursday. \u201cI think it will be as far out as any individual can push themselves because they care about what they do.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not worried about flying right now,\u201d he added, saying that as long as there are TSA officials on the job, \u201cI know the job is being done.\u201d His main fear, he told the panel, is that eventually, federal workers won\u2019t return to their jobs.\n\nThe FAA last week recalled several thousand inspectors and engineers, which it said were now essential for life and safety since the shutdown had passed the three-week mark.\n\nThe U.S. Senate on Thursday is prepared to vote on opposing plans to reopen the government\u2014one from Republicans that includes funding for President Trump\u2019s \u201cborder wall\u201d and another by Democrats that does not.

    "text": "Photo: Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s day 34 of President Trump\u2019s government shutdown with no end in sight. And while most of the media\u2019s attention has been focused on the long lines at airport security and food that\u2019s going uninspected, there\u2019s another topic that isn\u2019t getting much coverage: the potential for rampant corruption.\n\n\n\nThere\u2019s literally never been a better time to bribe someone who works for a U.S. government agency\u2014from the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to U.S. Coast Guard service members and State Department officials overseas. The RAND Corporation has a startling new report about the potential risks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cU.S. adversaries could exploit the shutdown by trying to corrupt border agents and airport screeners who are doing their jobs but not getting paid,\u201d Ryan Consaul, a senior researcher at RAND writes. \u201cTransnational criminal organizations and drug cartels have tried to bribe officers before.\u201d\n\nConasul notes that 144 U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers were arrested between 2005 and 2012 on charges related to corruption, and that was when people were getting paid. Now that government workers are being forced to work for free, things could get much worse.\n\nWith over 800,000 federal employees not getting paid right now, many have resorted to begging for money on GoFundMe, visiting food banks, and selling personal items on Craigslist. The risk of corruption is only growing with each passing day. Otherwise morally upstanding people are more willing to break the rules to make sure that they can survive when things get really desperate. And things are really desperate at the moment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the RAND report notes, Congress passed a bill in 2010 that attempted to curtail corruption at agencies like CBP, but that law was neutered by the Republican-controlled House in 2017 in an effort to speed up hiring.\n\nFrom RAND:\n\nOne investigation was of a Border Patrol agent who worked with drug traffickers to smuggle marijuana across the Mexican border into the United States. The agent pleaded guilty to conspiracy to import marijuana and was sentenced to 20 months imprisonment and three years of supervised release. The other investigation centered on a TSA employee who was observed meeting with a known narcotics/money courier in uniform at an airport and was later found with a bag containing $130,000. The TSA employee pleaded guilty and was sentenced to a year of house arrest followed by 48 months of probation. These examples are, of course, the rarest of exceptions. Nevertheless, the financial pressures caused by the shutdown provide U.S. adversaries with an opening to possibly exploit.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe new RAND article is primarily focused on agencies like CBP, but few people seem to be talking about other risks at places like the FBI and State Department\u2014organizations that hold incredibly sensitive information, including state secrets.\n\nIf America\u2019s New Cold War adversaries like China and Russia are looking to flip government officials and turn them into spies, now\u2019s the time to strike. But they know that already. That\u2019s one of the reasons that background checks for people in government positions include credit checks. Financially strapped police officers and diplomats have more of an incentive to betray their country. And unless President Trump gives up on his stupid and unnecessary border wall those incentives are only going to get more enticing.\n\nNot only is President Trump simply a blathering idiot, he\u2019s also making Americans less safe. Good job, Mr. President. Please open the government so that people can get on with their lives. You\u2019ve done enough damage already.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n[RAND Corporation]"

    "title": "Key Data For NASA's Ice-Monitoring Satellite in Trouble Thanks to Shutdown",
    "text": "Photo: NASA/Joe MacGregor (Flickr)\n\nLast month, NASA researchers were gleefully sharing the early returns from their recently launched ice-monitoring satellite, ICESat-2, at the world\u2019s largest annual meeting of Earth scientists. This month, many of those same researchers are furloughed as a vital airborne campaign needed to calibrate the satellite faces mounting delays due to the U.S. government shutdown.\n\n\n\nScience Magazine reported last week that the spring campaign for NASA\u2019s Operation IceBridge\u2014a series of airborne flights over the Arctic and Antarctic the space agency has been conducting since 2009\u2014would likely be delayed thanks to President Trump\u2019s fictitious crisis at the U.S. southern border. Now, several scientists involved with IceBridge and ICESat-2 have told Earther that campaign, initially slated to start on March 4 and run for eight weeks, faces delays of up to a month, perhaps cutting the field season in half.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuch delays would dramatically reduce the amount of data researchers will be able to collect this spring\u2014data that\u2019s needed to continue an uninterrupted record and verify data collected during the space agency\u2019s $1 billion ICESat-2 mission.\n\n\u201cA big part of our spring campaign plan was to do that [ground-truthing],\u201d John Sonntag, mission scientist for Operation IceBridge, told Earther. (Ground-truthing is the process of checking satellite measurements against measurements taken on Earth of the same thing.) \u201cUntil we do that, the taxpayer is not getting nearly as much of a return on their $1 billion investment in the spacecraft as they should be.\u201d\n\nThe IceBridge mission was designed to bridge the data gap between ICESat, a satellite laser altimeter that measured the height of Earth\u2019s icy surfaces from 2003 until 2009, and ICESat-2, which is now collecting similar data at a much higher resolution. These missions are providing NASA with crucial intel on how ice shelves and glaciers are melting and moving in a warming world, in addition to helping pinpoint subglacial lakes and other icy features. IceBridge aircraft are outfitted with a handful of laser altimeters to carry on the ICESat records, as well as radar instruments for peering through the ice and other mapping tools.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTypically, NASA conducts a roughly 2-month-long series of spring flights over the Arctic, followed by a month-long fall campaign in the Antarctic. With ICESat-2 now up and running, this year\u2019s spring IceBridge campaign\u2014the second-to-last for the Arctic with a shorter campaign planned for the summer\u2014plays a pivotal role. The team is planning to fly many of the same tracks that ICESat-2 does, allowing researchers to check and make sure the satellite is arriving at accurate measurements across a variety of icy terrains.\n\n\u201cBy having ICESat and IceBridge measurements at the same time we know exactly how those two datasets relate to one another,\u201d Ben Smith, a glaciologist at the University of Washington who serves on both the IceBridge and ICESat-2 science teams, told Earther.\n\nAccording to Sonntag, the P-3B Orion aircraft NASA is using for this spring\u2019s campaign was on a different mission last fall, and it requires maintenance before it\u2019s ready to fly again. While NASA received an exemption last week to begin that maintenance work before the P-3B falls into disrepair, Sonntag said the agency lost \u201cthe better part of a month\u201d and it\u2019ll take time to catch up. And the integration of the actual scientific instruments needed for IceBridge, including those laser altimeters, is completely stalled due to the shutdown.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow much these delays wind up impacting the data NASA collects this spring is still unclear. Sonntag said that after the spring Arctic campaign ends, the plane is needed for a different mission, so it\u2019s unlikely (though not impossible) IceBridge will be able to make up the lost time. Eric Rignot, a glaciologist at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory and lead scientist for IceBridge\u2019s land ice team, told Earther he expects the campaign to be shortened \u201calmost by half.\u201d\n\n\u201c[I] hope the shutdown will end soon because it could also threaten our preparation for a major deployment in Antarctica in the fall,\u201d Rignot told Earther in an email, referring to the fall IceBridge campaign. \u201cThis shutdown is damaging, and the damage will get more severe if it extends. Exponentially.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a significant loss of opportunity,\u201d said Ron Kwok, a researcher at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory who serves on both the IceBridge and ICESat-2 science teams.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKwok explained that if everything continues to run smoothly with ICESat-2 (and the satellite has been performing admirably so far), having a more limited IceBridge dataset for calibration shouldn\u2019t be a big deal. \u201cBut at this stage in time, we\u2019re still working through the data quality,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we didn\u2019t have a reference dataset to go back to if we needed, it would be a significant issue.\u201d\n\nSmith wasn\u2019t ready to wave it off as a minor inconvenience, either.\n\n\u201cI like to think that we can work around anything, but it\u2019s impossible to say at this point,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s adding uncertainty where the hope was with ICESat-2 we would be decreasing uncertainty.\u201d"

    "text": "Photo: Getty / John Moore\n\nA spending bill expected to pass the House and Senate on Thursday, and then be signed by President Trump before this weekend to avert another disastrous government shutdown, contains at least $100 million earmarked for the development of surveillance technologies such as unmanned aerial drones and facial recognition systems, according to a summary of the bill released Wednesday.\n\n\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi last month criticized President Trump\u2019s proposed border wall as an \u201can immorality,\u201d senior Democrats have touted the expansion of border surveillance, eagerly juxtaposing plans for new drones, license plate readers, and infrared sensors with Trump\u2019s physical barrier of concrete or steel\u2014a useful brush with which to paint the GOP\u2019s security proposals as antiquated, obsolete, and even \u201cmedieval.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Thursday said that Trump would sign the spending bill, adding that he\u2019d also throw his support behind the president\u2019s plan to declare a national emergency in an attempt to circumvent Congress and pull funding from other sources, including the Defense Department. In January, it was widely reported that the White House was examining ways to divert disaster recovery and military construction funds, including unspent money earmarked for disaster recovery in multiple states and Puerto Rico, where nearly 3,000 people died during and in the wake of Hurricane Maria.\n\nIn a statement, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said Trump would sign the bill and take executive action, \u201cincluding a national emergency.\u201d\n\nAccording to an explanatory statement submitted Wednesday by House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey, the $100 million will provide for a range of technologies, such as fixed towers, remote video surveillance systems, mobile surveillance capabilities, and a host of \u201cground detection\u201d capabilities, including video surveillance and small unmanned aerial systems. The statement notes carryover funding totaling $200 million has been similarly allocated and will also address the \u201ccross border tunnel threat.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCollectively, these measures have been labeled by Democrats a \u201ctechnological wall\u201d or \u201csmart wall\u201d or \u201cvirtual fence.\u201d\n\nAdditional funding will go toward a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) program that the Trump administration sought to shutter two years ago in order to free up money for a physical barrier: The VIPR program\u2014or Visible Intermodal Prevention and Response\u2014a series of security check teams intended to deter terrorism by creating a highly visible law enforcement presence, first at airports, and later in the transit systems of several major U.S. cities.\n\n\u201cWe know that the border is often a testing ground for surveillance technology that is later deployed throughout the United States.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe VIPR program, which saw its funding slashed in half over the last half-decade, has long been criticized by privacy experts due to repeated incidents in which officers showed flagrant disregard for Fourth Amendment protections. In a famous example of this, a VIPR team once seized control of an Amtrak station in Savannah, Georgia, and conducted warrantless searches of every citizen in sight, passengers who were both arriving and departing the station. The 2011 incident led Amtrak\u2019s police chief to temporarily bar Transportation and Security Administration (TSA) employees from the premises.\n\nThe funding bill agreed upon by the Democrats and the GOP is said to include $55,637,000 to maintain 31 VIPR teams.\n\nThe bill further includes funding for the Silicon Valley Innovation Program, a research and development initiative headed by DHS. The program will receive $10 million to fund \u201cnew technologies that strengthen national security.\u201d The funds go to companies with fewer than 200 employees involved in research largely geared toward increasing DHS and Customs and Border Protection surveillance capabilities. At least six companies are currently developing drones with the money, including some incorporating machine learning and voice recognition.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPlanck Aerosystems out of San Diego, California, for example, is reportedly developing a \u201ca fully autonomous, truck-based, search, surveillance, and data delivery platform for DHS applications operated from a dash-mounted user interface which delivers real-time video and object detection to drivers and passengers, without the need for a dedicated pilot or extensive operator training.\u201d Another, Kiana Analytics, is said to be developing a \u201csmartphone based interview capability that includes the remote identity verification of travelers using a combination of biometric information and behavior/trend analysis from sensors available in remote ports of entry used by travelers.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, a coalition of digital- and immigrant-rights groups delivered petitions signed by thousands of Americans to Washington opposing the Democrats\u2019 plan to expand surveillance at the border as an alternative to wall construction\u2014which the White House insists it intends to do anyway without Congress\u2019 approval.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s sickening to see both Republicans and Democrats add significant funding for invasive surveillance technologies to trample on millions of people\u2019s basic rights at a mass scale,\u201d said Evan Greer, deputy director of Fight for the Future, one of the groups involved in the protest alongside Access Now, Free Press Action, Demand Progress, and RAICES, the nation\u2019s largest immigration legal services non-profit, among others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwenty-eight technology and human rights organizations wrote to congressional leaders last week asking them not to fund privacy-invasive technology, some of which may be used at internal checkpoints found in an area extending 100 miles from the actual border. The letter expressed particular concern over technology such as license plate readers, drones, and technology designed to collect biometric and DNA data on immigrants and U.S. citizens alike. The groups called instead for \u201crobust oversight of government surveillance technology already deployed at the border,\u201d saying the development or funding of any new technology should be \u201ccontingent upon independent certification\u201d that it will not adversely impact Americans\u2019 privacy rights.\n\n\u201cWe know that the border is often a testing ground for surveillance technology that is later deployed throughout the United States,\u201d the letter said. \u201cUbiquitous surveillance technology poses a serious threat to human rights and constitutional liberties.\u201d\n\nCorrection: A typo in a previous version of this article incorrectly identified House Speaker Nancy Pelosi as the \u201cWhite House Speaker,\u201d a job title that doesn\u2019t exist."

    "text": "Photo: Getty Images\n\nIf you search words like \u201cshutdown\u201d on Craigslist in any major city in the country right now, you\u2019ll likely find increasingly desperate people. Roughly 800,000 government workers and countless contractors aren\u2019t getting a paycheck right now. And the resulting classified ads one sign of the heavy toll the shutdown is taking on those stuck in the middle.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s day 28 of the partial government shutdown, and President Donald Trump is keeping his promise to keep the government closed until he gets over $5 billion for his wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. Tens of thousands of employees have been ordered back to work, but they\u2019re not getting paid. Others are just waiting. Which means that those workers appear to be doing whatever they can muster to pay their bills, including selling things on Craigslist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOur government shutdown pain is your gain!\u201d one D.C. seller on Craigslist explains.\n\n\u201cNeed some money ASAP due to Govt. Shutdown,\u201d another says in an ad for an 18-month old Microsoft Surface Pro.\n\n\u201cDue to the government shutdown, stocks dropping and bills starting to become tight, I\u2019m selling this laptop and downgrading to make life a little easier,\u201d another seller in Olympia explains.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople are selling anything and everything, and plenty of people are selling vehicles, from the federal contractor in Denver selling his restored van to a seller in Portland explaining that their SUV is \u201cpriced to sell\u201d because \u201cI just need to pay bills an[d] rent asap.\u201d\n\nMusic instruments are often seen as expendable, as you can see from this acoustic guitar in Seattle and this electric guitar for sale in Cleveland.\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t want to part with this but the shutdown has really made things difficult so my loss is your gain,\u201d one guitar seller asking for $340 for their Ibanez in New York writes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s plenty of furniture too, including couches in West Palm Beach and kitchen tables in St. Louis.\n\n\n\nScreenshot: Craigslist\n\nShane Dean lives outside of Philadelphia and has had his motorcycle since 2013. But he\u2019s recently retired from the Coast Guard, and his wife is active duty. And with 12-year-old and 9-year-old girls in the house, he\u2019s had to put his Harley Davidson up for sale.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate, but it\u2019s out of our control. We just have to make the best of it,\u201d Dean told Gizmodo over the phone.\n\n\u201cWhen the government shut down, I pretty much put it on Craigslist instantly. That\u2019s something I can get rid of that would help us out to delay the bills. A couple of them anyway.\u201d\n\nHis girls are doing alright, Dean says, but they\u2019re noticing that mom is gone. Dean\u2019s wife, like the rest of the Coast Guard, isn\u2019t getting paid right now. Despite being a branch of the military, the money for the U.S. Coast Guard falls under the Department of Homeland Security, which is being directly affected by the government shutdown.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDean isn\u2019t looking forward to the shutdown extending beyond February 1, when the U.S. Coast Guard pension stops paying out. Roughly 50,000 retired members of the Coast Guard are expected to go without their pension checks if that happens.\n\n\u201cWhat little bit of pension I do get, which is a substantial amount for paying the bills, is going to be gone,\u201d Dean said.\n\nPeople who say they\u2019re affected by the shutdown are also turning to Craigslist to offer services and handmade items to hopefully take some of the stress off in these trying times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cDue to the Federal government shutdown I am trying to earn some extra money while my Active Duty husband is not getting paid. I have made several knitting/crafting project bags,\u201d someone who says they\u2019re from a military family explains in Washington state.\n\nSome are also using Craigslist to reach out to those government contractors in need. Like this charity in Georgia that\u2019s advertising free food to anyone affected by the government shutdown.\n\nPresident Trump\u2014who, BuzzFeed News reported yesterday, allegedly directed his former lawyer Michael Cohen to lie to Congress about his plans to build a tower in Moscow\u2014is doing lasting damage to the United States with his shutdown.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo when does this shutdown end? The Atlantic has a new article based on interviews with staffers of both parties on Capitol Hill. Everyone seems to agree that the only thing that\u2019s going to stop this madness is something really terrible happening.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take a big national event to move things. I mean, we\u2019re at a standstill,\u201d one anonymous aide told the Atlantic.\n\nOne Republican staffer is even quoted as saying that they could envision the shutdown lasting well into March, when food assistance programs will run out of money and low income people will no longer be getting food stamps. The number of people soliciting for donation on GoFundMe grows by the day as well, as you can imagine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUntil President Trump and Senator Mitch McConnell finally end this, they continue to harm America\u2019s long term prospects of being a stable and prosperous country. In the meantime, people will continue to sell stuff on Craigslist just to survive.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re lucky enough that we have some stuff saved up, we have other means of borrowing money,\u201d Shane Dean tells Gizmodo. \u201cBut we just have to take it step by step until this is over.\u201d\n\nDean adds: \u201cWe\u2019re all supposed to get back pay. But I never would\u2019ve believed they\u2019d ever stop any branch of military\u2019s pay, let alone the pensions. This is unthinkable.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf you have a story that you\u2019d like to share about how the government shutdown has impacted you and your family, you can email: novak@gizmodo.com."

    "text": "Photo: Jae C. Hong (AP)\n\nAfter President Donald Trump agreed to temporarily reopen the government, the National Park Service on Friday announced that some parks that remained closed during the 35-day shutdown would once again open to welcome visitors.\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press reported that hundreds of parks will be \u201creopening on a rolling schedule,\u201d with the National Park Service also noting not all will reopen right away. The Wright Brothers National Memorial and the Virgin Islands National Park were two parks that opened over the weekend, the Associated Press said, while Yellowstone National Park\u2019s visitor centers were expected to reopen Sunday.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe appreciate the support of state and local partners nationwide who stepped up to offer support to national parks,\u201d National Park Service Deputy Director P. Daniel Smith said in a statement Friday. \u201cWe are grateful to have the dedicated men and women of the National Park Service back at work, serving the American people and welcoming visitors to their national parks.\u201d\n\nAs many of the nation\u2019s treasured sites resume operations, others are bracing to tackle the lasting effects of the longest government shutdown in U.S. history. An estimated 16,000 National Park Service were furloughed, leaving many parks horribly understaffed and unable to manage visitors and campers.\n\nSome parks left with mere skeleton crews were forced to deal with overflowing garbage and illegal behavior. Yosemite Valley resident Dakota Snider told the Associated Press earlier this month that conditions at Yosemite National Park were \u201cheartbreaking,\u201d adding that there was \u201cmore trash and human waste and disregard for the rules than I\u2019ve seen in my four years living here.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother beloved national park, Joshua Tree, has become a symbol of the potential damage faced by sites that remain open and understaffed in the wake of a government shutdown. Park visitors strung the park\u2019s namesake trees with Christmas lights and in some cases cut them down to make roads for out-of-bounds camping. As the Associated Press noted, many of these trees are \u201chundreds of years old.\u201d\n\n\u201cFully reopening the federal government will mean so much to so many,\u201d Theresa Pierno, president and CEO of the National Parks Conservation Association, said in a statement Friday. \u201cFederal employees will finally get paid and be able to return to their jobs. For rangers and other park staff, it will mean returning to our national parks, assessing the terrible damage done to them while they were open with such limited staff, and once again welcoming visitors to the places they all love. Now is when the real work begins.\u201d\n\n\n\nTrump on Friday agreed to reopen the government for three weeks during negotiations, but said that if he\u2019s unable to get approval for his border wall, \u201cthe government will either shut down again on February 15 or I will use the powers afforded to me under the law and Constitution of the United States to address this emergency.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe implore lawmakers to use this time to come to a long-term funding agreement and avoid another disaster like this,\u201d Pierno said. \u201cFederal employees, businesses, communities, and national parks deserve better.\u201d\n\n[Associated Press]"

But there\u2019s no indication that a spending bill will be signed before the month ends; a matter of apparent consternation to the FCC\u2019s defense.\n\nMore than 800,000 federal workers are currently without pay. Negotiations between the White House and members of Congress appear at a standstill.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEvery one of these motions was denied; and every time, the Government then participated in oral argument.\u201d\n\nThe Justice Department\u2019s contingency plan for the shutdown advises government attorneys to request stays in all civil cases until funding becomes available. However, no law precludes the courts from hearing cases while the shutdown persists.\n\nThe odds aren\u2019t in the FCC\u2019s favor. In a 2-1 opinion issued last week, the D.C. Circuit denied a similar request while noting it\u2019s typical for the court to do so. The judges also mused that the government always shows up and argues its cases anyway.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the 2013 shutdown, the court received 16 requests to delay oral arguments. \u201cEvery one of these motions was denied; and every time, the Government then participated in oral argument,\u201d the opinion reads.\n\nThe suit against the FCC\u2014County of Santa Clara, et al v. FCC, et al\u2014is brought by numerous pro-net neutrality parties including the Mozilla Corporation, the Open Technology Institute, Free Press, Public Knowledge, and 21 state attorneys general, among others. The case includes numerous intervenors on both sides, including several trade organizations representing America\u2019s top internet service providers.\n\nRead the FCC\u2019s motion to postpone oral argument here."

Now, GoFundMe has initiated its own relief fund to help ease the burden for workers without pay.\n\nThe company partnered with Deepak Chopra on the campaign and will distribute the funds to a number of nonprofits actively working to cover federal workers\u2019 basic needs, including #ChefsForFeds and the National Diaper Bank Network.

According to GoFundMe, the campaign\u2019s goal will be increased once its initial target is reached.\n\n\u201cI wish we did not have to start a GoFundMe to help federal workers,\u201d Solomon said in a statement. \u201cUnfortunately we do. And because we live in an imperfect world, we have a simple choice: We can feel helpless while tragedy unfolds, or we can take action.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the shutdown stretches into a month, more than 800,000 government workers who have been furloughed or forced to work without any pay have taken desperate measures to provide for themselves and their families. In addition to well over 1,000 personal GoFundMe campaigns asking for assistance while the shutdown presses on, Craigslist has also been flooded with posts by individuals selling their property to make ends meet.\n\n\u201cEmployees of the most powerful nation in the world are being forced to work without pay and line up at diaper or food banks,\u201d Solomon said. \u201cIt makes no sense.\u201d\n\nDemocrats over the weekend shot down what President Donald Trump presented as a \u201ccompromise\u201d over his demands for funding for his border wall, with Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Saturday tweeting: \u201cWhat is original in the President\u2019s proposal is not good.

    "text": "Photo: Getty Images\n\nIf you don\u2019t pick up the phone anymore because each time it seems to be one of those annoying robocallers, you\u2019re not alone. A newly released report found that 26.3 billion robocalls were made to U.S. phone numbers in 2018, up 46 percent from 18 billion in 2017. Yikes.\n\nThe report was compiled by Hiya, a spam call monitoring app. In it, it found that the average person received 10 spam calls a month, with the top area codes targeted by spammers primarily coming from Texas. Dallas (214), Fort Worth (817), and San Antonio (210) topped the list.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe data is alarming, though a November report by the Federal Trade Commission on its Do-Not-Call Registry showed an overall decrease in filed complaints in fiscal year 2018. From October 2017 to September 2018, the agency received about 5.7 million complaints, of which 3.8 million were reports of robocalls and 1.9 million regarded live callers. That\u2019s down from 7.1 million overall complaints in FY 2017, of which 4.5 million regarded robocalls. But while the overall number of complaints may have fallen, the percentage of robocall complaints did increase from about 63 percent of the total to 66 percent. And according to the FTC\u2019s updated databook for the Do Not Call Registry, the most common types of robocalls received dealt primarily with debt reduction, medical prescriptions, and imposters.\n\nMeanwhile, the Federal Communications Commission said it received more than 52,000 complaints about caller ID spoofing in 2018 alone.\n\nThe scourge of robocalls has gotten national attention and created federal pressure to fix the problem. While both the FTC and FCC were impacted by the government shutdown, a Senate bill was introduced that could hit robocallers with a $10,000 fine for every call. Plus, there\u2019s hope for 2019. In November, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai called on carriers to adopt the SHAKEN/STIR protocol, which act as a type of caller authentication.

    "title": "How Long Before Facebook's New Petition Feature is Complicit in Genocide?",
    "text": "Photo: Getty Images\n\nFacebook, a tech company that the United Nations said has been literally complicit in genocide, has a new feature that\u2019s being rolled out this week. And there\u2019s a very good chance that it\u2019s going to be abused, no matter what assurances the company provides.\n\nFacebook\u2019s new feature is called Community Actions and functions much like a petition, according to Techcrunch. Community Actions has been in limited trials and will be introduced to a wider audience today, which means that we can probably expect a full-on abusive shitshow by Wednesday. Thursday at the latest.\n\nAccording to Techcrunch:\n\n\n\nUsers can add a title, description, and image to their Community Action, and tag relevant government agencies and officials who\u2019ll be notified. The goal is to make the Community Action go viral and get people to hit the \u201cSupport\u201d button. Community Actions have their own discussion feed where people can leave comments, create fundraisers, and organize Facebook Events or Call Your Rep campaigns. Facebook displays the numbers of supporters behind a Community Action, but you\u2019ll only be able to see the names of those you\u2019re friends with or that are Pages or public figures.\n\nOne advocacy group that got in on the feature early is called Colorado Rising which has advocated for a moratorium on new oil drilling in the state. The petition is tagged with both the governor and lieutenant governor of Colorado. But what happens when opponents of the group try to shut down the petition by flagging it as abusive?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOr what happens when some Trump supporter starts a petition to have all people of Mexican descent deported from the United States? You know it\u2019s coming. We all know it\u2019s coming.\n\nFacebook\u2019s community guidelines are open to interpretation, which means that we\u2019re probably going to see some very inconsistent enforcement as this new feature descends upon the world. All we know for sure is that plenty of people will test Facebook\u2019s limits and when some of them are shut down they\u2019ll cry censorship.\n\nOf course, there will no doubt be a handful of great petitions started. But if we\u2019ve learned anything from the past few years, it\u2019s that Facebook doesn\u2019t give a shit about anything aside from making money. And the social media network makes more money when it keeps you engaged and angry. Spreading joy doesn\u2019t pay the bills.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut who knows? I\u2019ve been wrong before. But new ways to engage with the world are the last thing that we need. As we\u2019ve seen with the government shutdown, you can complain all you want. And none of those complaints matter if a man like President Trump is in power.\n\nGizmodo has reached out to Facebook for comment and will update this post if we hear back. The company isn\u2019t very fond of getting back to media outlets that are critical of the damage that Facebook has done to the world. Which might explain why they told Techcrunch about their new feature before anyone else.\n\n[Techcrunch]\n\nUpdate 12:10pm: Facebook sent Gizmodo the following statement:\n\nBuilding informed and civically engaged communities is at the core of Facebook\u2019s mission. Every day, people come together on Facebook to advocate for causes they care about, including by contacting their elected officials, launching a fundraiser, or starting a group. Through these and other tools, we have seen people marshal support for and get results on issues that matter to them. Community Action is another way for people to advocate for changes in their communities and partner with elected officials and government agencies on solutions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSure. Why not."

    "title": "The TSA Found an Average of 11 Guns a Day in Carry-On Bags Last Year",
    "text": "Photo: Getty\n\nAmericans broke a new record last year, but it\u2019s nothing to write home about. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) found 4,239 firearms in carry-on luggage in 2018, breaking the previous record that was set in 2017. That\u2019s an average of more than 11 guns per day.\n\n\n\nThe number of guns found by TSA in 2018 was up roughly 7 percent from 2017, when 3,957 were found at TSA checkpoints, as the agency notes in a press release. But the most disturbing statistic might be that 86 percent of the guns discovered last year by TSA were loaded. Even more shocking, according to the TSA, \u201cnearly 34 percent had a bullet in the chamber.\u201d Yikes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom the TSA:\n\nThe top five airports where TSA officers detected guns at checkpoints in 2018 were: Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International with 298; Dallas/Fort Worth International with 219; Phoenix Sky Harbor International with 129; Denver International with 126 and Orlando International at 123.\n\nAmericans are able to legally fly with firearms, but they must be unloaded and locked away in checked luggage. Even replica guns and toy guns are required by federal law to be in checked luggage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrying to carry a gun on a plane is considered a civil rather than criminal matter under federal regulations, and if you\u2019re caught you face fines of up to $13,000. But TSA agents don\u2019t actually seize the guns that they find. That\u2019s the job of local police.\n\n\u201cI like to call it firearm detections,\u201d TSA regional spokesperson Mark J. Howell told Gizmodo over the phone. \u201cWhen we find those firearms we shut that lane down until law enforcement comes over. They remove the firearm from the machine and remove the person from the checkpoint.\u201d\n\nWhether local law enforcement simply cite the person with the gun or arrest them is up to the state law. But either way, the gun owner is going to get slapped with a federal fine.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe collect the information from [the gun owner] and we issue the civil penalty to them in the mail afterwards,\u201d Howell says, adding that it takes about a month for those citations to go out. \u201cAny confiscation is a determination made by law enforcement.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of them you have to go to court to get [the gun] back, others get them back right there, but that determination is made by local law enforcement.\u201d\n\nThe TSA\u2019s latest release also includes a breakdown of the past decade, which is fairly depressing. Back in 2008, just 928 guns were found by TSA agents nationwide. And the numbers have gotten worse every year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2018\u20144,239\n\n\n\n2017\u20143,957\n\n\n\n2016\u20143,391\n\n\n\n2015\u20142,653\n\n\n\n2014\u20142,212\n\n\n\n2013\u20141,813\n\n\n\n2012\u20141,556\n\n\n\n2011\u20141,320\n\n\n\n2010\u20141,123\n\n\n\n2009\u2014976\n\n\n\n2008\u2014926\n\n\n\nAmericans love guns in a way that\u2019s incredibly uncommon in the developed world. And as long as they\u2019re legal\u2014remember when President Obama was supposed to take everyone\u2019s guns away?\u2014they\u2019re going to be something that air travelers will live with for some time to come.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe best you can hope for is that guns don\u2019t make it through security, like they did recently in Atlanta. A woman got through TSA with a gun at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport on January 3 of this year and made it all the way to Japan\u2019s Narita International Airport in Tokyo with the weapon, according to The Washington Post.\n\nAt first, some people speculated that it might have to do with the government shutdown, but the TSA pushed back on that suggestion, stating that \u201cthe national call out rate was higher a year ago than this year on that date.\u201d It\u2019s just really hard to catch every gun that\u2019s going through America\u2019s airports. There\u2019s at least 11 every day, and if the past decade is any guide, that number is only going to be higher in 2019."

    "text": "Photo: AP\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering exactly how warm it was in 2018, you may have to wait for the U.S. government to start functioning again.\n\n\n\nEvery year around this time, NASA and the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) release their annual checkup on Earth\u2019s climate. Independent climate nonprofit Berkeley Earth also puts out its annual report, as do British climate scientists from the UK\u2019s Met Office and the University of East Anglia. It\u2019s a convergence of climate data nerds around the world to tell the public exactly how much Earth\u2019s sweating right now and remind us that we\u2019re the ones cranking up the global thermostat.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast year\u2019s report, published January 18, revealed that 2017 was the second warmest year on record. That report came on the heels of three back-to-back warmest years on record, from 2014-16.\n\n2018 isn\u2019t expected to be a record-breaker; in all likelihood, it\u2019ll go down as the fourth warmest year on the books. But while U.S. agencies were supposed to make that official today, their reports haven\u2019t arrived. Here\u2019s what you see if you try to access NOAA\u2019s National Climatic Data Center:\n\nScreenshot: NOAA\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA NOAA spokesperson confirmed to Earther that \u201cboth the timing of the 2018 State of the Climate report and climate research are impacted as a result of the lapse in funding.\u201d\n\nRobert Rohde, lead scientist at Berkeley Earth, told Earther his organization has \u201cindirect dependencies\u201d on the NOAA and NASA datasets. He said that while some automatic data collection is still happening, other manually curated products aren\u2019t being updated, and lots of tools for data access and analysis are offline at the moment.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been able to access some but not all of what we need,\u201d Rohde said. Same goes for the UK Met Office, which also relies on NOAA data, according to reporting by the New York Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, nobody\u2019s putting out a 2018 climate report just yet.\n\nRohde characterized the report\u2019s postponement as \u201cmostly a nuisance\u201d rather than a serious problem. But it\u2019s symptomatic of the many ways in which the government shutdown continues to hamstring science, be it by preventing researchers from attending conferences or stalling funds for long-term research and monitoring projects.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBob Ellis, a marine ecologist at the Florida Fish & Wildlife Research Institute in St. Petersburg, Florida, is one of the researchers feeling the stall. He told Earther he\u2019s been waiting to hear from NOAA on whether it\u2019ll extend funds for an acoustic array that tracks the Goliath grouper, a federally protected species of fish living along the state\u2019s southwest coast. The funding decision, which will impact the upcoming field season, was supposed to come in early January, but so far it\u2019s been radio silence.\n\n\u201cIf array extension [is] not funded we can find other fish to tag, but still a frustrating and stressful time,\u201d Ellis told Earther via Twitter DM. Countless other scientists have similarly had their research thrown into disarray.\n\nDeepti Singh, a climate scientist at Washington State University\u2014Vancouver, said that the impact of the shutdown on scientific data collection like this, particularly for projects with time constraints, \u201cis likely going to be more damaging immediately and in the long-run, and a waste of tax-payer dollars that went into supporting those activites.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnother long-term impact Signh is particularly conscious of is how the suspension of government research, as well as the availability of data and online resources, will affect the scientists of the future.\n\n\u201cThis year I\u2019m teaching a class on the Science and Policy of Climate Change and wanted my students to have the most up to date information on the state of the climate system provided by their federal agencies,\u201d Singh wrote Earther in an email. \u201cThese reports are not accessible at the moment and neither is the data that they would have been using.\u201d"

    "title": "Court Rejects FCC Motion to Postpone Net Neutrality Lawsuit Over Shutdown",
    "text": "Photo: Getty / Win McNamee\n\nShutdown or no, the consolidated lawsuits facing the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) over its 2017 rules that wiped out net neutrality protections nationwide will go forward on Feb. 1, a three-judge panel in the D.C. Circuit ruled Thursday.\n\nEarlier this week, the FCC sought to postpone oral arguments in the case, which are set to begin next month. In its motion, the agency claimed that the resources needed to advance its case were hamstrung by the ongoing government shutdown, with no end in sight. With its funding held captive amid a blistering political fight, the lawyers actively defending the commission against civil suits have been immobilized on paper, prohibited from any work irrelevant to \u201cthe safety of human life or the protection of property.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo the motion to postpone was mostly procedural. That\u2019s because the D.C. federal appeals court has previously ruled that denying such motions during a shutdown effectively constitute \u201cexpress legal authorization\u201d for the relevant agency work to continue under the Antideficiency Act, the law which prohibits the government from accepting \u201cvoluntary services\u201d from federal workers during a shutdown (absent threat to life or property).\n\nDuring the 2013 shutdown, the appellate court was asked to postpone oral arguments in sixteen cases involving the government, and each time it refused. Accompanying a denial in response to a similar request last week, in which one judge dissented, two circuit judges noted: \u201cEvery one of these motions was denied; and every time, the Government then participated in oral argument.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe suit against the FCC is brought by dozens of petitioners, including companies and organization such as the Mozilla Corporation, Public Knowledge, Free Press, the Open Technology Institute at New America, and 21 state attorneys general.\n\n\u201cIn a case where consumer protections are at stake, we are glad to see the hearing proceed as planned,\u201d said Amy Keating, Mozilla\u2019s general counsel. \u201cWe are looking forward to appearing on Feb 1.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt that time, the petitioners will explain aloud before a three-judge panel why they believe the net neutrality rollback will ultimately result in harm to consumers and small businesses. In turn, The FCC will defend its decision, with support from numerous intervenors; primarily trade groups that represent AT&T, Verizon, Comcast, and other major telecoms, which have for years fought to strip the commission of its authority to regulate internet providers against the predation and discrimination of users.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInterestingly, a recent phone-tracking scandal that left some Washington lawmakers furious, and which involves nearly every major wireless carrier, could come into play. When the FCC rolled back its net neutrality rules, it also abdicated its authority to investigate and punish carriers over privacy violations involving data (as opposed to phone calls) by revoking its Title II classification under the Communications Act.\n\nWhen called for an \u201cemergency briefing\u201d by a House oversight committee this week, FCC Chairman Ajit Pai refused to appear; again, blaming the shutdown. Pai claims to have initiated an investigation into the matter roughly eight months ago. Potentially, he\u2019ll try to punt the issue over to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which the FCC says is now responsible for all data-related carrier violations.\n\nUnfortunately, as we saw with the slew of Facebook scandals last year, the FTC is itself underfunded, understaffed, and otherwise completely outgunned when it comes to facing off against the nation\u2019s largest and most powerful internet companies."

    "title": "The Wild Dunes of Indiana Are in a Fight to Survive",
    "text": "Indiana is better known for sprawling suburbs and cornfields, but near the shores of Lake Michigan, these landscapes give way to something wilder. Beaches grow increasingly grass-anchored as one travels inland, creating dunes that slope into scrub punctuated by gnarled, sandblasted trees, which eventually give way to rolling deciduous forests. Verticality defying their placement in the flat Midwest, these forests feed wetlands that sidewind through the sandy mountains.\n\nIt\u2019s this very cascade of habitats that drew Field Museum climate change ecologist Katherine Moore Powell to the Indiana Dunes\u2014an amalgam of national lakeshores and state parks\u2014two years back. While scientists often have to traverse great distances to understand ecological transitions, here Powell can study a multitude of ecosystems within a stone\u2019s throw. That includes understanding how this microcosm of Midwestern habitats\u2014a biodiversity hotspot housing 158 species of mammals, amphibians, reptiles, fish, 120 types of dragonflies, damselflies, and butterflies, and over twice as many species of birds\u2014will be impacted by rising temperatures.\n\nThe park, with help from Powell, is preparing for dramatic changes. To Powell\u2019s knowledge, this is the first time a scientist unaffiliated with the National Park Service (NPS) has helped with its ongoing, nascent efforts to prep parks for climate change\u2014potentially establishing a blueprint for more comprehensive efforts to help protected lands adapt.\n\nAccording to findings Powell and the park have made, the Dunes\u2019 growing season will kick off earlier and stretch a month longer by 2050. Rising temperatures and an increase in \u201cextreme heat days\u201d above 90 degrees Fahrenheit will stress many insects (such as bumblebees) and allow southern tree species, warm-weather grasses, and invasive reeds to encroach, potentially pushing out cold-weather boreal pines and grasses, said Powell. Precipitation has already increased by 18 percent over the last century. By 2050, it could jump another 22 percent, falling increasingly\u2014in the dead of a formerly frigid Great Lakes winter\u2014as rain.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to have floods, and droughts, sometimes right next to each other,\u201d Powell said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of this will disrupt phenology, the syncing of seasonal cycles between organisms such as plants, pollinators, and their predators. Pollinators that are sensitive to the air temperature will start to stir earlier in the year, while the budding of plants, dictated by less fickle soil temperatures, might change more slowly. And the activity of birds, dictated chiefly by the length of each day, will change even less. This will stress many organisms, including vulnerable Dunes natives like the humble Pitcher\u2019s Thistle, and any vestiges of the Karner butterfly that may still be scraping by.\n\nPhoto: Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore / National Park Service (Flickr)\n\nMost threatened are seasonal wetlands called vernal pools. These are an \u201coasis in a mosaic of land,\u201d said Powell, which, largely free of predators, act as amphibian nurseries.\n\n\n\n\u201cThey are delicate, easily harmed, and once they are gone, they are difficult to get back,\u201d she said. Nevertheless, since, viewed at the surface, they don\u2019t convey into other waterways, they are speciously classified as \u201cgeographically isolated\u201d and unprotected by the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nSo, how does this landscape roll with the warming tide?\n\nReleased last spring, the Indiana Dunes Climate Change Adaptation Plan that Powell helped develop offers a blueprint for how at least one park can make a stand through three types of initiatives: resisting climate disturbance, making habitats more resilient to change, and aiding the transition of some ecosystems.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPhoto: Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore / National Park Service (Flickr)\n\nThe report recommends the park increase monitoring of and rapid responses to extreme conditions (e.g., flooding), hire more rangers to support changes, and incorporate more data from nonprofits such as the Nature Conservancy in decision making. Planting threatened species (and better-adapted hybrid plants, when appropriate), formulating a wanted list of encroaching southern plants to root out, and mapping wildlife corridors will help make habitats more resilient. The report also recommends stockpiling seeds from receding boreal pines to retain genetic diversity, adapting prescribed burns, and artificially deepening wetlands to hold floodwaters at bay.\n\nExperts with the Indiana Department of Natural Resources couldn\u2019t be reached to answer questions about which of these interventions are already being implemented. With the U.S. government shutdown still in effect, officials with the National Lakeshore are unable to comment entirely. And while the park hasn\u2019t had to deal with the piling trash and vandalism facing many National Parks, for the Dunes, as with parks across America, the battle to rewrite protections in the face of warming doesn\u2019t pick up again after the shutdown ends.\n\n\n\nEven when the government re-opens, parks openly making climate change adaption a priority may face opposition\u2014especially under an administration that has established a precedent of quashing mentions of climate change in reports. (Although, Trump\u2019s as-of-yet unconfirmed nominee for the NPS Director has expressed a belief that climate change is a priority.)\n\nPhoto: Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore / National Park Service (Flickr)\n\nFor Powell, who has always been passionate about saturated settings\u2014before working at the Field Museum, she was an ecohydrologist studying all the dynamic ways water flows through ecosystems\u2014no grounds have tested her more than the Dunes. There, she\u2019s waded through a career record of ticks. Deer bite at tubing for her sensors, forcing her to ward them off with foil. Mice overwinter in her instruments. \u201cI would open it [the instruments] up, and they would always stare up at me all terrified, and I\u2019m like \u2018But I have to take the measurements!\u201d she said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd birds of prey, in addition to defecating all over tower sensors, often also dive bomb colleagues climbing climbing the sensory equipment.\n\n\n\nBut despite the challenges of working in such an untamed place, diversity may be the Dunes\u2019 greatest asset when it comes to facing the hotter future. \u201cIf you have a healthy, functioning system with a lot of diversity, it can withstand a lot of stresses and disturbances,\u201d Powell said.\n\nThe question for the Dunes\u2014for parks across the world\u2014is if that diversity can be maintained, allowing them roll with the punches climate change dishes out."

    "title": "Tech Genius Donald Trump to Sign Executive Order on Artificial Intelligence Today",
    "text": "Photo: White House/Flickr\n\nPresident Donald Trump reportedly plans to sign an executive order today creating something called the American AI Initiative. The executive order is apparently a symbolic nod to artificial intelligence that doesn\u2019t create any new funding but encourages the federal government to do more with AI. And we can\u2019t help but wonder, what are the odds that President Trump knows anything about what he\u2019s signing today?\n\n\n\nWe don\u2019t even mean to be snarky or mean by asking the question. But it\u2019s worth asking given the president\u2019s dangerous incompetence and complete lack of intellectual curiosity. Does President Trump, someone who regularly insists that he knows a lot about technology but has used a computer maybe twice in his entire life, have any idea what he\u2019s signing later today? Do you think Trump could describe in even the most basic terms what his new American AI Initiative seeks to accomplish? As reported by multiple news outlets, the American AI Initiative is simply a \u201cstrategy\u201d to get the federal government more involved in artificial intelligence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe executive order will seek to \u201credirect\u201d existing funding, but it\u2019s not clear where that funding will be \u201credirected\u201d from. All we know for sure is that it won\u2019t be redirected from billionaires. They already got a huge tax break in one of the largest transfers of wealth from the poor to the rich in modern history. If nothing else, the White House seems to have provided plenty of meaningless buzzwords about the AI endeavor.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re excited to be developing principles and an agenda with American values in mind,\u201d one anonymous Trump regime official told the Wall Street Journal. \u201cThat is something we\u2019re excited to share with the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis executive order is about ensuring continued America leadership in AI, which includes ensuring AI technologies reflect American values, policies, and priorities,\u201d an anonymous official told Axios.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAI is something that touches every aspect of people\u2019s lives. What this initiative attempts to do is to bring all those together under one umbrella and show the promise of this technology for the American people,\u201d an anonymous Trump regime official told Reuters.\n\nWhat does any of that mean? Your guess is as good as ours. And we expect to hear precisely as much stirring detail about it after President Trump signs the thing later today. What are the odds that Trump\u2019s aides simply said the words \u201cit\u2019s to fight China\u201d and Trump said okay before turning his attention back to Fox News? Pretty good.\n\nIf it seems like you\u2019re seeing the news of President Trump\u2019s executive order everywhere this morning, that\u2019s by design. News organizations all hit publish on their stories at midnight, presumably because the White House approached them with a news \u201cembargo.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome of the headlines that news organizations went with overnight:\n\nThe stated purpose of a news embargo is to allow news organizations time to talk with experts and get an independent opinion without rushing a story to press. Gizmodo honors embargoes all the time, especially for science coverage. But embargoes are often used for cynical, public relations purposes. And this appears to be a case of the latter. It\u2019s almost as if the White House was able to press \u201cpublish\u201d on half a dozen press releases simultaneously, all while keeping the government sources completely anonymous for some reason.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s genuinely strange that the Trump regime is able to get away with this kind of control over news in an environment where they\u2019ve ruined so much. The president has been exposed as arguably the most corrupt politician of the past 100 years as he continues to profit from his position in countless ways and his own lawyer is going to jail for something that the president instructed him to do. Not to mention that President Trump has overseen some of the most barbaric human rights violations on American soil in recent memory through his immigrant family separation policy\u2014something that Trump regime members still insist isn\u2019t an actual policy despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.\n\nTwo children have even died in government custody in recent months and countless others are enduring systematic child abuse through the country\u2019s concentration camps for asylum seekers. And yet everything is moving along like normal. The White House still issues news embargoes and media organizations still publish what the White House wants them to publish precisely when the White House wants them to publish it.\n\nAnd to make matters even more strange, congressional talks have apparently broken down and America is headed toward another government shutdown on February 15 over the president\u2019s racist border wall with Mexico.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYes, it seems like it\u2019s going to be another of those weeks. But if we\u2019re being honest with ourselves every week is one of those weeks now."

    "title": "Report: The FTC May Slam Facebook With 'Record-Setting' Fine Over User Privacy",
    "text": "Photo: Elise Amendola (AP)\n\nFederal Trade Commission staff assessing whether social media giant Facebook violated a legally binding user privacy agreement with the agency are considering slapping the company with a \u201crecord-setting fine,\u201d the Washington Post reported Friday, citing \u201cthree people familiar with the deliberations but not authorized to speak on the record.\u201d\n\n\n\nAt issue is whether Facebook violated a 2011 deal with the FTC, known as a \u201cconsent decree,\u201d that required the company to notify and obtain explicit opt-in consent from users before sharing their data beyond their selected privacy settings. It also required Facebook to notify the FTC of cases in which data was misused, as well as prohibited it from \u201cfrom making misrepresentations about the privacy or security of consumers\u2019 personal information.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn early 2018, it was revealed that Facebook had allowed an app developer working with the (extremely sketchy) Cambridge Analytica political firm to download data on millions of users, and then did very little to get it back. Former FTC Bureau of Consumer Protection director David Vladeck told the Post the incident raised \u201cserious questions about compliance.\u201d Facebook\u2019s list of scandals, many of them having to do with reckless handling of user data, has kept growing since.\n\nIn theory, the FTC could fine Facebook up to $40,000 per violation, though with tens of millions of users affected by the breach, that would run into the trillions. According to the Post, the fine under discussion is more modest but would still dwarf a prior fine of $22.5 million the FTC slapped Google with in 2012.\n\nThe FTC has not finalized any decision, the paper wrote:\n\nThe FTC\u2019s exact findings in its Facebook investigation and the total amount of the fine, which the agency\u2019s five commissioners have discussed at a private meeting in recent weeks, have not been finalized, two of the people said. Staff has briefed the commissioners about their probe, the third person said, and plan to issue a formal recommendation for a fine soon \u2014 a move that would then trigger a vote by the commissioners. Facebook also has talked with FTC staffers about the investigation, one of the people familiar with the probe said, but it is unclear whether the company would settle with the FTC by accepting a significant financial penalty.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, the Cambridge Analytica incident was not isolated but the result of site policy that was not changed until the years 2014-2015, when Facebook shut down programs allowing app developers extensive, bulk access to user data. As such, the FTC may determine that Facebook was sharing user data in violation of the consent decree as a routine business practice. According to the Post, two sources told them that additional fines could follow \u201crelated to Facebook\u2019s data-sharing agreements with smartphone and TV device-makers, banks and other major businesses and a full roster of third-party apps.\u201d\n\nNews of the possible fine was confirmed by the New York Times, which noted that FTC chair Joseph J. Simons has ordered staff not to leak details to the media and that the investigation is being slowed by the ongoing government shutdown.\n\nNothing is set in stone, and the FTC commissioners sometimes disregard the advice of staff when making decisions. But if the FTC does come down hard on Facebook, it would be a major blow: The company is already reeling from a wave of media and political criticism, while user trust has plummeted. A recent Pew Research Center survey found that users are largely confused about how Facebook categorizes them for advertising purposes, with slightly over half saying they were \u201cnot very or not at all comfortable\u201d with the conclusions Facebook had reached about their interests.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSuch a decision would also mark a significant escalation in terms of official consequences. While Facebook and government officials in the UK, where Cambridge Analytica was headquartered, have been feuding for months, the UK\u2019s Information Commissioner\u2019s Office was only able to hit the company with a $645,000 fine\u2014less than the company makes in ten minutes.\n\n[Washington Post]"

The firestorm of inquiries began after it was revealed that during an investigative sting, a Motherboard reporter was able to obtain the physical location of a phone he\u2019d planted in Queens, New York, after shelling out $300 to some shadowy figure in a back-alley deal.\n\nFifteen U.S. senators joined that chorus on Thursday by seeking a response from the Trump administration, whose regulatory chiefs have had nothing substantive to say about the story, which detailed, in part, how \u201cbounty hunters\u201d had created their own black market for Americans\u2019 location data.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA letter by the senators to the heads of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reads:\n\nLast year, multiple news reports highlighted the fact that the four major wireless carriers, AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon, sold their customers\u2019 location data to approximately seventy companies, without the explicit knowledge or consent of their customers. After significant negative press coverage, the wireless industry pledged to end these business practices.\n\nOf course, that never happened. (Of the four major carriers, only Verizon is thought to have actually ended the practice.) The letter continues (emphasis ours):\n\nA recent investigation published by Motherboard, however, demonstrated not only that the wireless carriers are still failing to protect their customers\u2019 private information, but also that location data can be purchased by stalkers, domestic abusers, and others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo be clear, the regulatory environment that allowed these dubious sales to take place is the direct result of lobbying by the major carriers themselves. Weeks after President Trump was inaugurated, telecom lobbying effectuated the rollback of landmark Obama-era privacy rules intended to protect consumers, by way of notice and consent, from this precise form of abuse. The vote to repeal the rules in early 2017 fell largely along party lines, with only 15 House Republicans siding against it.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the FCC, which has been repeatedly called on to investigate the matter, may find itself without the power to do anything about it, even if it does determine the carriers are at fault.\n\nAnd it certainly bears mentioning, this is entirely by design.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSince taking control of the commission in early 2017, FCC head Ajit Pai, a Republican, has worked tirelessly to strip the very agency he chairs of its power and its responsibility to protect consumers against the \u201cunjust or unreasonable\u201d practices of companies like T-Mobile and AT&T.\n\nPai did so first by supporting the rollback of the FCC\u2019s privacy rules\u2014where he pushed all responsibility off onto the FTC\u2014and later by leading the charge to rollback the nation\u2019s net neutrality protections, which had previously reclassified internet service as a \u201ctelecommunications service,\u201d thus granting Pai\u2019s agency the power to investigate and punish carrier for such abuse.\n\nTo put it another way, the feckless ineptitude displayed by Pai since this phone-tracking scandal first broke nine months ago is not unintentional but reflects the precise level of power major telecoms wanted him to wield and no more. This circumstance, under which virtually anyone can pay money to physically locate the owner of a mobile phone, was engineered\u2014as was the crippling of the agency that, under the former administration, would have had complete authority to pursue and punish those responsible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAll of this was done in the name of enlarging the profits of AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, and Verizon, none of which are jumping at the opportunity to accept responsibility for their malfeasance or acknowledge that Americans, who care deeply about their privacy, deserve better than an apology in the first place.\n\nPai rejected an opportunity to brief House lawmakers about the issue last week, showing precisely how seriously he\u2019s taking the matter. Pai pinned the blame on the shutdown, but as lawmakers noted, there\u2019s nothing legally stopping him from having a discussion about this with members of Congress. He told Motherboard this week: \u201cThe FCC already has been investigating this issue. Unfortunately, the investigation had to be suspended because of the partial government shutdown. It will resume once the shutdown has ended.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s also claimed that his agency has been investigating the carriers for over eight months, though there\u2019s no available evidence to support that\u2019s been happening, and a meeting on the Hill this month would have been his opportunity to prove otherwise.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmericans\u2019 only hope in the near-term is that maybe their phone companies will actually stop carelessly handling their data this time, even though they may be under no legal obligation to do so and it will almost certainly affect their profits. Then again, perhaps the FTC will aggressively take up the mantle and, maybe in a year or so, we\u2019ll see the fruit of that investigation.\n\nMaybe even Congress, which can\u2019t even keep the government funded at this point, will miraculously pass a law this year reining in the need of telecoms to constantly harm consumers by treating them like a commodity\u2014that is, if it can pass both chambers without being watered down by politicians whose pockets are lined by the very industry whose violations of the public trust are at issue.\n\nTo be fair, it\u2019s entirely possible that T-Mobile and friends violated other laws during this debacle, and there\u2019s little evidence to show that merely notifying consumers about privacy policies and seeking their consent is sufficient.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat is obvious, however, is that none of the deals these companies struck with third-parties to hawk their customers\u2019 data got approved without the strict scrutiny of legal counsel. Someone in mahogany-laden c-suite office somewhere at each of the companies surely signed off on all of this. Whether they wittingly allowed the data to find its way into the hands of \u201cbounty hunters\u201d or not, they surmised, perhaps correctly, that the liability on their end, were that to happen, would be negligible.\n\nAfter all, they worked very hard, with the help of some friends in Washington, to ensure that was the case."

    "text": "Goodbye Big Five Reporter Kashmir Hill spent six weeks blocking Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, and Apple from getting her money, data, and attention, using a custom-built VPN. Here\u2019s what happened.\n\nWeek 2: Facebook\n\n\n\nAfter Facebook\u2019s hell-year of scandal, and its unabating erosion of our privacy\u2014a topic I\u2019ve been covering for over 10 years\u2014I never thought I\u2019d miss the social network. But here I am, staring at my screen, feeling strangely alone.\n\nIn the second stage of my epic quest to thwart the world\u2019s most powerful tech giants from getting my data, my money, and my attention, I\u2019m taking on Big Blue. No Facebook. No Instagram. No WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Onavo, nor Oculus Rift. For one week, I\u2019m cutting myself off from everything Facebook-related\u2014not simply deleting apps from my phone, but using a custom tool that completely stops all my devices from communicating with Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s enormous, needy baby.\n\nOriginally, I just planned to block myself from using Facebook the same way I\u2019d blocked myself from using Amazon, by routing all my internet traffic through a virtual private network (VPN) controlled by the technologist Dhruv Mehrotra, who is prohibiting my devices from communicating with the 122,880 IP addresses controlled by Facebook. But I decide this experiment is an opportunity to do something additional, something more drastic.\n\nFacebook\u2019s misdeeds with our data have been news cycle fodder for at least a decade, but the past year has been particularly bad. The only explanation for why most of us are still members is Stockholm Syndrome. Like many people, I feel invested in Facebook: I\u2019ve been building my profile since 2007. I have party and vacation photos galore there and over 1,000 connections, including dear friends, acquaintances, colleagues, loved ones, and quite a few randos whom I added for reasons that I no longer remember. I\u2019ve written that people who aren\u2019t on Facebook \u201cmay not actually exist\u201d and are \u201csuspicious.\u201d I use Facebook to log in to other services that I use a ton such as Airbnb, Words with Friends, and Spotify.\n\n\n\nI couldn\u2019t quit Facebook, could I? And if I did, would I miss it? Would the world I\u2019ve built there miss me?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFacebook has steamrolled almost the entire planet into joining its platform, so it\u2019s amazing how damn thirsty it seems much of the time. To prepare for the Faceblock week, I sign into Facebook one last time and discover 36 notifications waiting for me.\n\n\n\n\u201cDamn! Must be some big things happening,\u201d I think, but when I click on the white bell, I discover 35 notifications about one friend\u2019s comment on a link I had shared earlier in the week. Facebook had been adding a new notification every few hours since the last time I had signed in, in what must have been a desperate attempt to get me to open its app. I\u2019m not alone in getting countless irrelevant notifications on Facebook.\n\n\n\n\n\nI feel about quitting Facebook the same way I feel about deleting my tweets, something I also don\u2019t do that I probably should: I\u2019m concerned there could be unanticipated downsides. But this is as good a time as any to find out, so I click the \u201cdelete\u201d button.\n\n\n\nTo my great surprise, my account is instantly gone. I thought Facebook would tempt me to stay with profile photos of friends who would be \u201csad\u201d without me, but my account just winks out of existence immediately with a message that I can have it back if I sign into Facebook within 30 days. (I put a reminder in my Google Calendar to reconsider this decision in 29 days, and hope that Google Calendar is not blocked when the time comes.)\n\n\n\nOf course, while I can \u201cdelete\u201d my Facebook, that doesn\u2019t delete all my information from its servers, even after 30 days. It still knows what other people share about me, from photos of me and my family, to my contact information if others upload it.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe first thing I do after the big deletion is visit Airbnb. My biggest concern is that I\u2019ll be locked out and lose years of building up a good reputation as a renter, but I soon discover to my vast relief that I can regain access by saying I forgot my password and supplying my email address. I still have my Airbnb account; it is just untethered from Facebook. Spotify too lets me back in, though my profile photo is gone and my name is replaced with an eight-digit string of numbers. I can also get into Words With Friends, my favorite time-wasting app. It looks like all these companies are planning for the eventual obsolescence of Facebook, thank god for me.\n\n\n\nThe Amazon block took out whole websites and services for me, but that\u2019s not the case with Facebook, because it doesn\u2019t control the building blocks of the internet. That\u2019s not for want of trying: Facebook has attempted to bring \u201cuniversal internet\u201d to India and other countries with internet.org, but it has faced resistance.\n\n\n\nDhruv built a counter that tells me in real time how many data packets are trying to get a tech giant; it was spinning like crazy when I was blocking Amazon, but advances far more slowly with Facebook. (Over the course of the week, my devices try to communicate with Facebook over 15,000 times compared to nearly 300,000 times for Amazon the week before.)\n\n\n\nThe vast majority of Facebook\u2019s requests are likely its attempts to track my movements around the web, via Like and Share buttons, Facebook Analytics, Facebook Ads, and Facebook Pixel. Facebook Pixel, if you haven\u2019t heard of it, is a little piece of code that a company can put on its website\u2014say, on a particular sneaker page that you look at while signed into Facebook on your work computer. Once the pixel captures you looking at the sneaker page, the shoe company can retarget you through Facebook, so you later see an ad for the same shoe when you\u2019re scrolling through Instagram on your personal phone.\n\nIn an email, a Facebook spokesperson just \u201cwanted to point out\u201d that \u201cyour experience seeing advertising across devices is common and not new to online advertising.\u201d True, but unlike Pixel, not every web tracker is on over 2 million websites.\n\nCutting Facebook out of my life is easy technically; Dhruv\u2019s IP address block works well. His only challenge is WhatsApp, which has been designed to circumvent blocks in repressive countries, and so rapidly tries to reach different servers when it detects an inability to connect. (Dhruv compares blocking that one to playing whack-a-mole.)\n\n\n\nBut psychologically, it\u2019s hard: I miss Instagram as the thing I do to waste time on my phone and to keep up with friends. I also miss, to my surprise, Facebook itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe first day of the Facebook block is Halloween, which is particularly hard because I can\u2019t post cute photos of my 1-year-old, Ellev, dressed up as Boo from Monsters Inc. (I ordered the costume on Amazon, of course, pre-block.) And I can\u2019t find out what my friends are dressed as unless I individually text or email them, which is weird. The only people who get to see my family as Boo, James P. Sullivan (me), and Mike Wazowski (my husband) are the members of my extended family with whom we trick-or-treat, the strangers we pass IRL, my in-laws due to a photo sent on a group text thread, and a couple of friends to whom I text photos apologizing for the \u201cbespoke sharing.\u201d I have to admit that the enjoyment of a holiday dedicated to dressing up is somewhat degraded when not using Facebook\u2019s apps.\n\nPhoto: Trevor Timm\n\nThe week of the block also includes the runup to Election Day. One morning, as I talk to my husband, Trevor, about filling in our mail-in ballots, I ask how he is going to vote on the proposition to end daylight saving time in California. He says his cousin wrote a convincing post about it on Facebook (we talk in links even IRL!) and I say I\u2019ll check it out before I remember I can\u2019t. Trevor summarizes it for me: The time change sucks for parents who have to force their kids to wake up an hour earlier. This is a point I wouldn\u2019t have thought of and a conversation we might not have had without Facebook, and it helps swing my vote.\n\n\n\nI know. It\u2019s crazy, right? Even with all the news about how terrible information is around elections on Facebook, I still want it as a resource! This is a shocking discovery for me. Did I turn off Facebook during the one week it actually matters to me, or do I use Facebook more than I realize?\n\nI try to fill the social media hole in my life by joining Mastodon, an open-source, decentralized Twitter-like social network. (You \u201ctoot\u201d instead of \u201ctweet,\u201d a term chosen by someone who either doesn\u2019t know the standard definition or who believes most of what people write online is noxious hot air.) I try a toot or two, but honestly, I find the idea of building yet another online social network exhausting. So after signing in a couple of times, I abandon it. Network effects are real and powerful.\n\n\n\nSarah Jeong summed up the problem well in Vice soon after Mastodon\u2019s October 2016 launch:\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou aren\u2019t on Mastodon because your friends aren\u2019t on Mastodon. Your friends aren\u2019t on Mastodon because you\u2019re not on Mastodon. And I wouldn\u2019t be on Mastodon, either, if I hadn\u2019t promised my editor to write an article about it.\n\nThis is the hold Facebook has on us: We built our networks there, and we are loathed to leave them or to start again.\n\nWith the purchases of Instagram and WhatsApp, Facebook has a stranglehold on social news and photo-sharing. By blocking them, I lose the ability to mass communicate with my social circle; I can\u2019t brag that I won a journalism award on Facebook or post a video of Ellev feeding a giraffe at the zoo on Instagram.\n\n\n\nI also lose my ability to receive news from my social circle. Spoiler: When I give in and re-enable my Facebook account weeks later, I see at the top of my Newsfeed that one of my closest friends recently gave birth. I call her to congratulate her and tell her I wouldn\u2019t have found out if I hadn\u2019t re-joined the social network. \u201cI just assume that if I post something on Facebook, everyone will know about it,\u201d she tells me.\n\nIf you give up Facebook and all the companies it owns, you\u2019re cut off from participating in your community, whatever your community may be.\n\n\n\n\u201cFacebook has too much market power,\u201d Sarah Miller tells me. \u201cIt should never have been allowed to acquire Instagram in the first place.\u201d\n\n\n\nMiller is the deputy director of the Open Markets Institute, which has spent the last year loudly calling for the tech giants to be heavily regulated if not broken up. Miller is also the spokesperson for Freedom From Facebook, an advocacy group composed of members of other advocacy groups, like an activist turducken, that has done cute stunts like fly a plane over Facebook\u2019s shareholder meeting with the sign, \u201cYou broke democracy.\u201d\n\nMiller thinks the Cambridge Analytica scandal and Facebook\u2019s notable missteps around disinformation and genocide, are symptomatic of a company run amok without serious competitors to force it to be a better gatekeeper of people\u2019s information.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFreedom From Facebook has been pushing the Federal Trade Commission to treat Facebook like a monopoly and break it up. On that count, they scored a meeting with an FTC commissioner, Joe Simons, and have filed a complaint with the agency, though it\u2019s unclear how serious the FTC is about investigating Facebook. A top official there who would otherwise be in charge of such an investigation is conflicted out, but the Washington Post reports that the agency is currently considering hitting the company with a \u201crecord-setting fine,\u201d that is, if the government shutdown ever ends.\n\nThough Miller doesn\u2019t think a fine is enough, even a historic one; she argues that the FTC should force Facebook to spin off WhatsApp, Instagram, and Messenger into their own companies, because together Facebook\u2019s companies account for \u201c77 percent of mobile social networking traffic in America.\u201d\n\n\n\n\u201cIf a company doesn\u2019t have competitors, it\u2019s not incentivized to protect consumers,\u201d Miller tells me during a phone call. \u201cIt\u2019s more than just privacy violations. We\u2019re trying to tie everything together. Will our democratic institutions stand up to these companies or let themselves be corrupted?\u201d\n\nFacebook, of course, disputes any notion that it\u2019s a monopoly. \u201cWe operate in a fiercely competitive market for services which help people connect, discover, communicate and share,\u201d a Facebook spokesperson told me. \u201cFor every service offered on Facebook and our family of apps, you can find at least three or four competing services with hundreds of millions, if not billions, of users.\u201d\n\nLate in the week, Instagram notices I haven\u2019t opened the app in a while and sends me an email prompting me to see what my friends are up to. And I realize I don\u2019t really know what people are up to. My friends now largely expect that I\u2019ll see their broadcasts on various social networks, which means they don\u2019t tell me things individually anymore, unless I see them in person.\n\n\n\nOr the alternative happens: I assume I know everything that\u2019s going on with someone because I\u2019ve been following their feed. I recently went to visit a college friend who lives across the country. We text each other every weekend with our favorite photos from the week, and I felt like we were in relatively good touch, but once I\u2019d spent a few days with her, I discovered there was ground-shaking stuff happening in her life about which I\u2019d had no clue. It made me realize just how limited many of my digital communication channels are.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s the proverbial double-edged sword: I feel both out of touch when not on these channels, but like I\u2019m worse at being in touch because they exist.\n\n\n\nFunnily enough, reading a draft of this story convinces one of my editors, who has never had Facebook or Instagram, to join the latter because he realizes he doesn\u2019t have a way to show cool things \u201cto a bunch of people I know at the same time without texting them [when] they\u2019re not really worth texting over.\u201d\n\n\n\nSo I don\u2019t know if this series will convince anyone to quit these tech giants, but it has convinced at least one person to join them.\n\nNext up: Google.\n\nThis series was supported by a grant to Dhruv Mehrotra from the Eyebeam Center for the Future of Journalism."

    "text": "What a debacle President Trump\u2019s shutdown proved to be \u2014 what a toddler\u2019s pageant of foot-stomping and incompetence, of vainglory and self-defeat. Mr. Trump tormented public servants and citizens and wounded the country, and, in conceding on Friday after holding the government hostage for 35 days, could claim to have achieved nothing.\n\nHe succeeded only in exposing the emptiness of his bully\u2019s bravado, of his \u201cI alone can fix it\u201d posturing. Once upon a time, Mr. Trump promised that Mexico would pay for a wall. He instead made all Americans pay for a partisan fantasy.\n\nMaybe you want a wall. Can you possibly argue that Mr. Trump\u2019s shutdown strategy advanced your cause? He made the right decision on Friday \u2014 to sign a bill reopening the government through Feb. 15, giving lawmakers time to reach a permanent deal. But he could have had this same outcome without a shutdown. He ultimately agreed to the sort of bill that Democrats have been pitching for weeks \u2014 one that contains not one dollar in wall funding.\n\nIn his announcement, the president struggled to obscure his failure with yet another rambling infomercial about the glory of walls. \u201cNo matter where you go, they work,\u201d he said (raising the question of how you can get there if, in fact, there\u2019s a wall in your way). He had nothing of substance to offer beyond the usual specious claims that only his wall can end the border flood of drugs, crime and migrant women who have been duct-taped and stuffed into vans by human traffickers . To repeat: Fewer border-crossing apprehensions were made in 2017 than at any time since 1971 ; drugs are overwhelmingly smuggled through established points of entry; and the only crisis at the border is a humanitarian one, of people fleeing violence and seeking asylum \u2014 again, mostly at established points of entry \u2014 under international law."

    "text": "\u201cBoth sides listened to each other, and believe that there\u2019s a way forward,\u201d said Representative Josh Gottheimer, Democrat of New Jersey, who attended the session. He called it a \u201cproductive conversation,\u201d but added, \u201cIt\u2019s critical that we reopen the government first, for our safety, our security, our economy.\u201d\n\nSarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, called the meeting \u201cconstructive,\u201d and said, \u201cThey listened to one another, and now both have a good understanding of what the other wants.\u201d\n\nAnother attendee who insisted on anonymity to describe the private discussion said neither side considered it a negotiating session, and Mr. Trump did not embrace the idea of reopening the government before the border barrier issue was settled. The president began the session with an extended talk about what he described as the crisis at the border, while lawmakers told him about the effects of the shutdown on their districts.\n\nIn the Senate, a group of Republicans and Democrats was also working to persuade the president that no progress was possible as long as the government remained shuttered. It circulated a letter that called on Mr. Trump to drop his demand for wall funding as a condition of ending the shutdown, urging him to agree to sign a three-week stopgap government funding measure to allow time to forge a \u201cbroad bipartisan agreement\u201d on border security spending.\n\n\u201cWe commit to working to advance legislation that can pass the Senate with substantial bipartisan support,\u201d said the letter, which was spearheaded by Senators Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware. \u201cDuring those three weeks, we will make our best efforts following regular order in the appropriate committees and mark up bipartisan legislation relating to your request.\u201d\n\nThe letter has support from several other Republican senators, including Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, Susan Collins of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rob Portman of Ohio, as well as centrist Democrats including Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, according to several officials familiar with it who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe the effort. But the White House was quietly lobbying against it, and proponents were having a hard time persuading Republicans to sign on."

Trevor Noah isn\u2019t surprised.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s crazy that Michael Cohen was rigging polls for Trump, while Trump was out there complaining that the polls were rigged.

    "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 A pair of measures to reopen the government \u2014 one with President Trump\u2019s border wall, the other without it \u2014 failed in the Senate on Thursday, sending lawmakers from both parties into frenzied efforts to forge a compromise that could end the nearly six-week partial shutdown.\n\nIn back-to-back votes, the Senate first blocked Mr. Trump\u2019s proposal to add $5.7 billion for his border wall to legislation to resume funding for the government, then turned back a Democratic measure that omitted the wall. Neither side was able to garner the 60 votes needed to advance its bill.\n\nBut the results undercut the president by revealing that his proposal drew less support in the Republican-controlled Senate than did the Democrats\u2019 plan, which attracted a half-dozen Republicans willing to break with Mr. Trump. And with the shutdown reaching a grim milestone on Friday as 800,000 federal workers miss a second consecutive paycheck, pressure is mounting in both parties to find a solution.\n\nIn a lunch meeting before the votes, Republican senators vented their concern to Vice President Mike Pence about the prolonged shutdown, according to two people familiar with the discussion, which grew tense at times. Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, who has previously counseled against allowing government funding to lapse, was among those arguing that it should never have occurred, they said."

Mr. Trump signed it on Friday night, restoring normal operations at a series of federal agencies until Feb. 15 and opening the way to paying the 800,000 federal workers who have been furloughed or forced to work without pay for 35 days.\n\nThe plan includes none of the money for the wall that Mr. Trump had demanded and was essentially the same approach that he rejected at the end of December and that Democrats have advocated since, meaning he won nothing concrete during the impasse.\n\nMr. Trump presented the agreement with congressional leaders as a victory anyway, and indicated in a speech in the Rose Garden that his cease-fire may only be temporary: If Republicans and Democrats cannot reach agreement on wall money by the February deadline, he said that he was ready to renew the confrontation or declare a national emergency to bypass Congress altogether."

    "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 As congressional leaders urged their colleagues to support a bipartisan border deal, President Trump said on Wednesday that he did not want to see the government shut down at midnight Friday, indicating that he was leaning toward signing the compromise legislation.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to see a shutdown. A shutdown would be a terrible thing,\u201d Mr. Trump said, later hinting that he had \u201coptions that most people don\u2019t understand\u201d to build his border wall without congressional approval.\n\nThe remarks, which were made to reporters in the Oval Office as Mr. Trump met with the president of Colombia, inched him toward embracing a bipartisan border deal that fell far short of his demands for wall funding. But without a shutdown as leverage, he appeared to have little choice but to sign it if it clears Congress.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, 17 negotiators rushed to turn the border compromise into voluminous legislation, while both Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, and Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, encouraged their troops to support it. The 1,159-page bill and a full report from negotiators were filed Wednesday minutes before midnight; the Senate is expected to vote on the measure on Thursday, followed by the House."

Nearby, the towns that rely on Yosemite tourism for their livelihoods were hurting. Mr. Yager, who runs a cleaning service, laid off most of his employees.\n\nEvery day the shutdown stretched on, Mr. Yager said, people were \u201cmore and more desperate.\u201d\n\nIt has been more than six weeks since the blustery Oval Office confrontation on Dec. 11 between Mr. Trump and Representative Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, and Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader.\n\nMr. Trump, reiterating his campaign pledge to build a border wall, had said he would take the blame for shutting down the government if Democrats rebuffed his effort. \u201cI will take the mantle,\u201d he said in a vow that was replayed on cable news countless times. \u201cI will be the one to shut it down.\u201d\n\nAnd it did shut down, in the early morning of Dec. 22. The shuttered departments included Treasury, Agriculture, Homeland Security, Interior, State, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Commerce and Justice. More than 420,000 federal employees began to work without pay; another 380,000 were furloughed to wait for a resolution from home.\n\nYet the notion of a government shutdown still felt to many like a familiar political ritual rather than a fear-inducing event, at least at first. This shutdown marked at least the 21st time in the last four decades that the government has not passed some form of a spending bill on time.\n\nIn the first days and weeks, a tangle of complications began to emerge.\n\nSheila Bailey, 73, had set her retirement for Dec. 31, after working for 34 years as a scientist at NASA\u2019s John H. Glenn Research Center in Cleveland. And indeed, the date came and went, and Ms. Bailey is spending her days at home."

    "text": "WASHINGTON \u2014 The five-week federal government shutdown took a significant economic toll, costing the United States economy $11 billion, with nearly a quarter of that total permanently lost, the Congressional Budget Office said on Monday.\n\nThe figures are the first official projection of the economic effects of the longest federal shutdown in history, and they show that its cost was nearly double the $5.7 billion request by President Trump for a border wall that fueled the impasse. That is enough to reduce first-quarter growth by about 0.4 percentage points.\n\nMuch of that spending was simply delayed, and will flow back into the economy as workers get back pay. But the report makes clear that not all the economic damage will be undone and that the effects of the shutdown will linger. With the federal government funded for just three weeks and Mr. Trump threatening to shutter the government again if his demands for a wall are not met, many workers say they are planning to spend less of their income and increase rainy-day savings.\n\nKelly Spencer, a federal contractor at the Justice Department, was planning to buy her first home this spring, but as she returned to work on Monday, she said she was shelving those plans."

    "text": "But the ideas amount to a tacit acknowledgment by Democrats that, even as they criticize Mr. Trump\u2019s tactics and demands in the shutdown fight, they have largely allowed him to define the terms of the debate on border security, and that they must be more effective in articulating their own position on the issue.\n\n\u201cPeople want to make sure that it\u2019s clear that the Democrats do stand for border security, and not allow the president to determine how we talk about it,\u201d said Representative Ro Khanna, Democrat of California. \u201cWe can\u2019t cave to his vision for a wall, because of everything that it represents, but we also want to show that we\u2019re for something.\u201d\n\nThe issue came up in a meeting of the Democratic caucus this week as Ms. Pelosi was briefing rank-and-file lawmakers about her latest broadside against Mr. Trump over the shutdown: her letter requesting that he delay or cancel his State of the Union address this month in light of the security measures that would have to be provided by federal workers who are working without pay. Mr. Trump\u2019s response was to prevent Ms. Pelosi from taking her trip on a military plane.\n\nHis letter to Ms. Pelosi announcing that step also disclosed her itinerary, which was secret given that Afghanistan was her destination. Official congressional trips are kept confidential for security reasons, particularly when they involve travel to war zones and high-ranking leaders like the speaker, who is second in line to the presidency.\n\n\u201cYou never give advance notice of going into a battle area \u2014 you just never do,\u201d Ms. Pelosi told reporters at the Capitol, adding that Mr. Trump may not have understood that because of his inexperience.\n\n\u201cThe people around him, though, should have known that,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s very dangerous.\u201d\n\nAfter Ms. Pelosi rushed to salvage the trip by making alternative travel arrangements to fly commercial instead, people close to Mr. Trump who had been briefed revealed the speaker\u2019s plans to reporters late Thursday. By dawn on Friday, said Drew Hammill, her deputy chief of staff, facing a heightened State Department threat assessment and amid concern that the administration\u2019s leaks had further compromised the safety of those involved, Ms. Pelosi canceled the trip.\n\nA White House official on Friday denied the charge, saying that there was no way for Ms. Pelosi to have kept her trip a secret and that any suggestion of a leak \u201cis a flat-out lie.\u201d"

    "text": "They have damaged rising stars of the past. Bobby Jindal was widely panned in 2009 when, as governor of Louisiana, he delivered the Republican response to Barack Obama\u2019s joint address to Congress, and Senator Marco Rubio\u2019s response in 2013 is remembered more for his sudden lunge for water than his answer to Mr. Obama.\n\nThe buildup to this year\u2019s address has been more dramatic than past years. Speaker Nancy Pelosi originally invited Mr. Trump to deliver the annual address to Congress in the House chamber this week, but she rescinded that invitation amid the government shutdown. On Monday, with the government reopen, the speaker and the president agreed to a new date, Feb. 5.\n\nMr. Schumer alternates with Ms. Pelosi each year on choosing the Democratic respondent. Last year, Ms. Pelosi selected Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III of Massachusetts, the scion of a Democratic dynasty who is among the party\u2019s most popular young figures. Without using Mr. Trump\u2019s name, Mr. Kennedy chastised the Trump administration for \u201ca rebuke of our highest American ideal\u201d and pledged to fight for the millions of immigrants brought to the country illegally as children, known as Dreamers.\n\nIn 2017, Mr. Schumer chose Steve Beshear, the former governor of Kentucky, to deliver a response to Mr. Trump\u2019s first joint address to Congress.\n\nMs. Abrams is the former minority leader of the Georgia House of Representatives whose 2018 run for governor electrified black and liberal voters and drew significant national attention and money to the state. She has founded a national organization to bring minority voters to the polls and combat voter suppression efforts."

    "text": "It was hard to see the headlines proclaiming that the north magnetic pole is speeding toward Russia and not feel a pang of anxiety. Vladimir Putin annexing the North Pole? Climate change threatening more global chaos? Malevolent cosmic rays about to burst through Earth\u2019s magnetic shield?\n\nThe stories under the headlines proved less alarming. The sudden (in cosmic terms) lurch of the north magnetic pole turned out to be a phenomenon for which humans bore no responsibility and for which responsible institutions and monitors (well, when the United States government was not shut down) had effective solutions.\n\nThe magnetic pole is the spot a compass points to as north; it is distinct from the geographic North Pole, which is where all the lines of longitude meet at the top of the world (and where Santa Claus maintains his workshop). For now, it is situated four degrees south of the geographic North Pole.\n\nThe Earth\u2019s magnetic poles, it seems, have always been on the move, and have even swapped places several times over the eons. The reason is that the molten iron deep inside our planet sloshes around, shifting the magnetic field with it. And since compasses point to the north magnetic pole wherever it happens to be at any given time, the United States and Britain collaborate in issuing an updated World Magnetic Model every five years to make sure everyone\u2019s on the same map."

I came from a pretty conservative background but I can\u2019t think of ever seeing anybody at my college putting shoe polish on their face or a sheet over their head under the theory that it would make them look cool. And Ralph Northam was in medical school! I know medical students aren\u2019t all the omni-dedicated healers we saw on \u201cE.R.\u201d But good grief.\n\nBret: I don\u2019t know if we really differ. But I think context and intention matter. Billy Crystal did \u201cblackface\u201d for a Sammy Davis Jr. impression, and I don\u2019t think Crystal is racist in any respect. Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel and Sarah Silverman, to name a few boldface names, have all done blackface. If we\u2019re going to start excommunicating people from public life for this, we\u2019re going to destroy a lot of people who almost surely intended no harm.\n\nGail: Yeah, but I don\u2019t remember Billy Crystal doing his act with a guy wearing a sheet.\n\nBret: That\u2019s true. And I think that\u2019s in a different league in terms of offensiveness. But again, I think we need to better understand the context, whether it was connected to a pattern of behavior, and whether it was ever repeated. And again, we are talking about an incident from 35 years ago followed by an admirable life without any hint of racial bias.\n\nRight now, Northam\u2019s real moral jeopardy is that he has contradicted himself and is doing a duck-and-cover move. He has a good opportunity to rise above it, first by clarifying how exactly that photo ended up on his yearbook page \u2014 and whether he\u2019s one of the people in the picture, as he now claims he isn\u2019t \u2014 and then by explaining why the casual racism of a past generation mustn\u2019t be communicated to the present.\n\nGail: I do find it hard to believe he looked at that picture and said: \u201cWho are these people? How did they get in my yearbook?\u201d He\u2019d be a gone goose now if the Legislature wasn\u2019t busy talking about trying to impeach the lieutenant governor over some terrible allegations of sexual assault.\n\nDid you know Virginia has, for all practical purposes, a one-term limit for governors? I\u2019m wondering if that has anything to do with all these crises."

So how are furloughed workers spending their free time?\n\nMany are, of course, dealing with the very serious consequences of going without pay for an extended period. But in terms of what they're doing to unwind during these tense times, Pornhub offers one possible answer.\n\nIn data released Thursday, the adult video platform reports that traffic showed an average daily increase of 5.94% during the week of Jan. 7th (the shutdown's third week) over traffic in the weeks before the shutdown, which started on Dec. 22.\n\nImage: Pornhub\n\nNow, it's important to note here that correlation doesn't equal causation. After all, it's winter and people are spending more times indoors instead of out and about and, well, people have to stay entertained somehow. No judgment here!\n\nThat said, Pornhub notes a shift with heavy increases in traffic late at night with lower traffic than usual during the morning followed by another traffic spike in the early afternoon. These patterns are similar to other events like winter storms, situations in which people might stay up later because they don't have to go to work the next day.\n\nAdditionally, Pornhub traffic in the Washington, D.C. area showed a similar spike over the same time period with an average daily increase of 6.32 percent versus pre-shutdown traffic.\n\nImage: Pornhub\n\nPornhub also notes the following categories showed the biggest increase in traffic during that measured time:\n\nOutdoor +71%\n\nThreesome +66%\n\nOld/Young +60%\n\nMake of that what you will.\n\nAs for methodology, the week of Jan. 7th was selected by Pornhub for measurement as it was likely to no longer be affected by holiday vacations while the pre-shutdown traffic averages were taken from the weeks of December 3rd through 7th and December 10th through 17th.\n\nWhether the spike in traffic continues remains to be seen, but for now there's no real end in sight for the shutdown."

    "text": "UPDATE: Jan. 25, 2019, 4:41 p.m. EST The shutdown is over (for now) so keep an eye on the accounts below as they'll crackle back to life soon.\n\nOn Dec. 22, 2018, when parts of the federal government went into shutdown mode, it caused a ripple effect that's continued to be felt by workers and the public alike, sometimes in unexpected ways.\n\nAmong the wide-ranging consequences of the shutdown has been the silence from the various National Park accounts on Instagram, which have amassed millions of followers across the various handles. The main National Park Service Instagram even has a whopping 1.3 million followers.\n\nThe National Park Service posted a message on its account on Dec. 21, 2018 that read, \"During the federal government shutdown, we will not monitor or update social media. Some National Park Service areas are accessible, however access may change without notice, and there are no NPS-provided services. For more information, visit the park\u2019s website ... \"\n\nSimilar messages were found across the various park-specific accounts.\n\nThis, of course, makes sense as the posts are handled by federal workers \u2014 park employees or a NPS employee based in Washington, D.C. \u2014 and those folks are at home like hundreds of thousands of other federal employees who aren't getting paid.\n\nThe lack of pretty photos is hardly the only troubling thing happening with the National Parks system during the shutdown. Because sections of many parks are still open to the public without any oversight, there have been problems ranging from bathrooms overflowing with waste and garbage to a horrible subset of people seemingly intent on doing damage to these invaluable natural resources.\n\nAnd that's just because of the current shutdown, never mind the deep maintenance deficit the system is still struggling with.\n\nThe Instagram accounts coming back to life won't fix many of the issues. But these accounts have been a tremendous success \u2014 and not just in the form of marketing tools that attract more visitors to the parks or fill your Insta feed up with pretty pictures.\n\nThe photos and livestreams that happen across these accounts are key tools of advocacy for the parks, be it protection of wildlife living in the parks, educating the public on everything the National Park Service and its employees do, or even promoting ecologically-friendly behavior.\n\nBy pulling in millions of people with stunning photos, the parks can then reach a much larger audience when they need to spread the word about conservation efforts or visitor tips, like what do when a bison walks up and licks your car.\n\nIf you want to keep your Instagram feed full of National Park photos, there are non-government accounts that can scratch that itch for you. Accounts like National Park Geek, Parks Project, and the National Park Foundation (the NPS's charitable partner) have been keeping the 'gram game going during the shutdown.\n\nAnd there's always getting in on the action yourself. After all, many of the parks are still open across the country, so if you live near one, consider going and capturing your own stunning photos. The shutdown helped inspire me to drag my poor dog out into the cold to visit my nearest National Park, even in the dead of winter.\n\nCuyahoga Valley National Park Image: Marcus Gilmer/Mashable\n\nHopefully, even without the activity on the Instagram accounts, love and attention can still be paid to the National Parks. Whether it's donations for upkeep, volunteering to clean up, or simply making a point to visit, maybe these accounts can still draw much-needed support and attention.\n\nYou can check out a variety of ways to help out National Parks during the shutdown at this National Park Foundation post.\n\nWhatever the case, just be sure to make yours a safe visit and pick up after yourself."

So they were still putting in their usual hours, but they were doing it without pay.\n\nFlight attendants work for private interests \u2014 they're airline employees \u2014 but they're also the ones who are most at risk as the infrastructure responsible for keeping planes in the air breaks down. There are Federal Aviation Administration rules requiring flight attendants to be present on planes of a certain size.\n\nIn other words: flight attendants may not have been furloughed, but they had what could accurately be described as a vested interest in easing the strain the shutdown placed on air traffic controllers.\n\nThe quiet finally broke on Friday. Faced with growing reports of air travel interruptions, representatives from the flight attendant and air traffic controller unions sounded an urgent alarm: fix this immediately or planes are going to start crashing.\n\nAir traffic controllers \"are making mistakes that they hadn\u2019t made in the 10, 15, 20 years .... They\u2019re making them because they\u2019re stressed out, because they don\u2019t know when this [shutdown] is going to end.\"\n\n\n\n\u2014Trish Gilbert, National Air Traffic Controllers Assoc.\n\nVia PBS pic.twitter.com/aIBN89GVWo \u2014 Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1) January 25, 2019\n\nCritical Update on Shutdown: Flight disruptions are starting. The system is unraveling as we had predicted. Watch this update and then get to your nearest congressional office to demand lawmakers open the government. https://t.co/fhLoiLnmfe #EndTheShutdown #StoptheShutdown pic.twitter.com/BBM9pynpcQ \u2014 AFA-CWA (@afa_cwa) January 25, 2019\n\nHours later, the shutdown was over. It wasn't some bargaining breakthrough brokered by President Trump's fabled acumen as a deal-maker. Rather, it was the country's month-long transformation into trembling, overstuffed pressure cooker.\n\nAs many observers pointed out in the hours that followed, the final straw broke across the back of angry, exhausted aviation workers.\n\nHere is the flight attendants' statement today. It is literally the only thing that matters. If you're crediting some rich plutocrat who derides \"the lefties\" for this shutdown ending, you're doing political analysis wrong.https://t.co/kG43aFdiIT \u2014 Heidi N. Moore (@moorehn) January 26, 2019\n\nI am so proud of the air traffic controllers, flight attendants, & workers who, through their organizing, should be credited for their role in ending the shutdown.\n\n\n\nDems only have the House (for now), so we must rely on the bravery + organizing of everyday people to push change. https://t.co/4vFzvZ1PrM \u2014 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC) January 26, 2019\n\nDems were glad to watch Trump\u2019s approval rating tank over these last weeks. Trump is not opening gov bc of Pelosi or Stone\u2019s arrest. He\u2019s opening gov because WORKERS shutdown a major US airport. Air traffic controllers, flight attendants & other WORKERS won this fight. https://t.co/f521EMFj4s \u2014 Anya Parampil (@anyaparampil) January 26, 2019\n\nThe temporary end of the shutdown isn't a victory for Nancy Pelosi or any other Democratic elected official. It's a victory for the airport workers who called in sick and threatened to go on strike. They raised the specter of airline chaos and forced Trump's hand. \u2014 Micah Uetricht \ud83c\udf39 (@micahuetricht) January 25, 2019\n\nAnyway, as a footnote to this particularly miserable chapter of American history, it seems like the union closest to taking things to the next level to stop the shutdown was the Association of Flight Attendants: https://t.co/bxNqwhI9H9 \u2014 Matt Pearce \ud83e\udd85 (@mattdpearce) January 25, 2019\n\nRelieved about the end of the shutdown today?\n\n\ud83d\udc4a THANK A #UNION \ud83d\udcaa\n\nSpecifically:\n\nThank the @afa_cwa\n\nPrez @FlyingWithSara\n\nfor mobilizing the #flightattendant force & declaring SAFETY as the urgent drive for #solidarity.https://t.co/pT35FH3yY9 \u2014 Michael DeVito Jr. (@mdevitojr) January 25, 2019\n\nTrump couldn\u2019t take another night of air traffic controllers, pilots, flight attendants on TV saying flying isn\u2019t safe because of the Trump shutdown. https://t.co/iBHTB1Z0xb \u2014 Lawrence O'Donnell (@Lawrence) January 25, 2019\n\nHere's a final word from Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants-CWA and absolute boss of this moment.\n\n.@lucymcbath, Flight Attendants Rock. That is all. \u2014 Sara Nelson (@FlyingWithSara) January 26, 2019\n\nUPDATED Jan. 26, 2019, 12:31 p.m. ET: An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified flight attendants as federal workers. Flight attendants work for the airlines, and their shutdown frustrations stem from a declining sense of safety as air traffic controllers increasingly felt the strain of absent paychecks. We apologize for the error, and have updated this story to make the distinction clearer."
